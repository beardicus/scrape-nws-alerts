<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 10 at 5:10AM PST until January 10 at 10:00PM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Snow accumulations between 2 and 6 inches, with up to 8
inches in foothill locations above 5000 feet. A few locations may
receive up to 1 foot in more persistent heavy snow bands. Winds
gusting 40-55 mph, with gusts 60-75 mph in wind prone areas,
including US-395/I-580 and foothill locations.
* WHERE...In California, Surprise Valley California. In Nevada,
Northern Washoe County and Greater Reno-Carson City-Minden Area.
* WHEN...Until 10 PM PST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous conditions
will impact the afternoon-evening commute today. Strong winds
could cause damage to trees and power lines. Sudden reductions in
visibilities of less than a 1/4 mile with whiteout conditions
possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Today`s event is forecast to be worse than
the snow event observed this past Saturday. Enhanced snow bands
accompanying a cold front will bring quick, heavy snowfall in a
short period with locally heavier amounts possible if these bands
stall. With these bands expected to pass through during the peak
school/work commute time, major travel disruptions are possible.
Very cold temperatures behind the front may lead to flash freezes
on roadways and prolonged hazardous travel conditions into the
Thursday morning commute.</description>
