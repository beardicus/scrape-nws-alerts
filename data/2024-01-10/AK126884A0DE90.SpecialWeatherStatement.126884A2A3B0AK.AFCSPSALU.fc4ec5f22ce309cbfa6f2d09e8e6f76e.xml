<description>...WINTRY MIX TO CONTINUE FOR THE KUSKOKWIM DELTA AND NUNIVAK
ISLAND THROUGH EARLY FRIDAY MORNING...
A wintry mix of light to moderate snow, occasionally mixed with
rain is expected to continue through early Friday morning for
Nunivak Island and the Kuskokwim Delta coast. Temperatures are
expected to be in the low 30s throughout the time period. Highest
snow accumulations are expected to be around Nunivak Island
(Mekoryuk) and the northern Kuskokwim Delta coast (Toksook
Bay/Newtok) with lower accumulations expected further south
(Chefornak/Kipnuk) where warmer air intrudes.
Further inland around Bethel, light freezing rain or freezing
drizzle, occasionally mixed with rain, will continue until around
midnight tonight before precipitation ends. Ice accumulations of
up to a glaze are possible. Temperatures are expected to continue
to warm overnight into the mid 30s with a transition to mostly
rain expected for Thursday. There is potential for cold air to
nudge back in for Thursday evening for another potential brief
round of rain/snow mix before ending early Friday morning.</description>
