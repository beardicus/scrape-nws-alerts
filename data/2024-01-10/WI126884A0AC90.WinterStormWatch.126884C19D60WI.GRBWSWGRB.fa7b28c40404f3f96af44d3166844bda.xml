<description>...SNOW TO IMPACT DOOR COUNTY LATE TONIGHT INTO THURSDAY MORNING...
...ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT WINTER STORM TO IMPACT THE REGION WITH HEAVY
SNOW AND STRONG WINDS FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING...
.An upper level disturbance will bring a swath of 1 to 3 inches of
snow to much of the region tonight into early Thursday.
Lake-enhancement will bring higher amounts to Door County, where
accumulations of 3 to 5 inches, locally higher, are anticipated. The
snow will result in hazardous travel conditions late tonight into
Thursday morning.
A strengthening low pressure system will track from the
mid-Mississippi Valley to the central Great Lakes from Friday
morning through midday Saturday. The strong system will bring heavy
snow and strong winds to the region. Probability of at least 6
inches of snow range from 70 to 90% across the Fox Valley and
lakeshore areas, and from 50 to 70% across parts of central and far
northeast Wisconsin. In addition, wind gusts could reach 45 mph or
higher in the Fox Valley and lakeshore areas, where near-blizzard
conditions are possible. Temperatures near to slightly above
freezing could locally reduce snowfall totals right along the Lake
Michigan shoreline.
