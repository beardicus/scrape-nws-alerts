<headline>Coastal Flood Watch issued January 10 at 4:01PM EST until January 13 at 2:00PM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY MORNING THROUGH
SATURDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Potential for 2 to locally 3 feet of inundation above
ground level in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and
shoreline.
* WHERE...Southern Queens County.
* WHEN...From Saturday morning through Saturday afternoon.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Potential for widespread moderate to
locally major flooding of vulnerable areas near the waterfront
and shoreline Saturday morning. Potential for 2 to locally 3 ft
of inundation above ground level in low lying, vulnerable
areas. This would result in numerous road closures and cause
widespread flooding of low lying property including parking
lots, parks, lawns and homes/businesses with basements near the
waterfront. Vehicles parked in vulnerable areas near the
waterfront would likely become flooded. Flooding will also
extend inland from the waterfront along tidal rivers and bays.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...Breaking waves of 8 to 12 ft along the
oceanfront may result in scattered dune erosion and localized
overwashes. Localized flooding of roadways and vulnerable
structures behind protective dunes is possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Timing of windshift of southeasterly gales
to southwesterly gales in relation to the time of high tide
Saturday morning will be key to water level forecast. This will
be refined over the next 48 hours.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
