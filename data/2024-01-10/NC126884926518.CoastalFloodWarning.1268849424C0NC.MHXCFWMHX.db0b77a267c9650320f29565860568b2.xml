<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 PM EST THIS
AFTERNOON...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EST
TONIGHT...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, 2 to 3 feet of inundation
above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of
8 to 12 feet in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Ocracoke Island and Hatteras Island.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, until 3 PM EST this
afternoon. For the High Surf Advisory, until midnight EST
tonight.
* IMPACTS...2 to 3 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in a threat of property damage. Numerous roads may be
closed. Low lying property including homes, businesses, and some
critical infrastructure may be inundated. In some areas,
battering waves will cause additional damage to property.
Moderate to significant ocean overwash is likely, mainly from
Oregon Inlet to Ocracoke. This will likely impact portions of
Highway 12, which may be impassable at times, especially around
times of high tide. High tide is around 6 AM Wednesday. Moderate
to significant beach erosion expected, along with very rough
surf.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.</instruction>
