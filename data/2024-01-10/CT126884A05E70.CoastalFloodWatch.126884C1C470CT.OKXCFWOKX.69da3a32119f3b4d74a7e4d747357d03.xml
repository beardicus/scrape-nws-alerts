<headline>Coastal Flood Watch issued January 10 at 7:12PM EST until January 13 at 2:00PM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY MORNING
THROUGH SATURDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Potential for 2 to 2 1/2 feet of inundation above
ground level possible in vulnerable areas near the waterfront.
* WHERE...Southern Middlesex and Southern New London Counties.
* WHEN...From Saturday morning through Saturday afternoon.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Potential for widespread moderate
flooding of vulnerable areas near the waterfront and
shoreline, Saturday morning. Potential for 2 to 2 1/2 ft of
inundation above ground level in low lying, vulnerable areas.
This would result in numerous road closures and cause
widespread flooding of low lying property including parking
lots, parks, lawns and homes/businesses with basements near
the waterfront. Vehicles parked in vulnerable areas near the
waterfront would likely become flooded. Flooding will also
extend inland from the waterfront along tidal rivers and bays.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...Potential for breaking waves of 3 to 5 ft
during the Saturday morning high tide. This would result in
beach erosion, and wave splashover onto shoreline roads and
properties.
* RIVERINE IMPACTS...Freshwater runoff coinciding with the
Saturday morning high tide could exacerbate street and
property flooding issues along tidal reaches of rivers in
southeastern CT.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Timing of windshift of southeasterly
gales to southwesterly gales in relation to the time of high
tide Saturday morning will be key to water level forecast.
This will be refined over the next 48 hours.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
