<description>...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 1030 AM EST THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...A portion of upstate South Carolina, including the
following county, Pickens.
* WHEN...Until 1030 AM EST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Common, deeper flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to
area streams is continuing with lesser impacts to vulnerable

boat-access areas, and golf courses.  Inundation may be several
feet deep. Other flood-prone areas will be impacted including
low-lying roadways, low-water crossings, underpasses, and parking

flooded and impassible, with deeper flows over roadways possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...

crested but remain above Minor Flood Stage following earlier
heavy rainfall.  It will take several more hours for these

streams fall back below critical levels.  Expect lingering
flooding to continue near the flea market and Concord Church
Rd along Twelvemile Creek.  Along Eighteenmile Creek,
flooding may be continuing along Bishop Branch Rd and Central
Rd.

include...
Easley, Clemson, Pickens, Central, Liberty, Norris, and Six
Mile.
