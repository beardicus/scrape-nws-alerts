<headline>Flood Watch issued January 10 at 3:38AM EST until January 10 at 12:00PM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>.Heavy rain is falling on a deep primed snowpack leading to the melt
increasing. Flows in rivers may increase quickly and reach critical
levels even after the rain moves out of the area.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall and snow melt
continues to be possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Maine, including the following areas,
Androscoggin, Central Interior Cumberland, Coastal Cumberland,
Coastal York, Interior York, Kennebec, Lincoln and Sagadahoc and
New Hampshire, including the following areas, Belknap, Coastal
Rockingham, Eastern Hillsborough, Interior Rockingham, Merrimack,
Strafford and Western And Central Hillsborough.
* WHEN...Through this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Flooding is likely to occur in poor drainage and urban
areas. Storm drains and ditches may become clogged with snow and
other debris. Rapid rises along small streams will also be
possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Heavy rainfall along with warm temperatures will cause
melting of the snowpack south of the foothills. The runoff
will be rapid due to the frozen ground conditions, supporting
the potential for flash flooding in urban areas as well as
small stream crossings. Travel across the watch area will be
impacted as numerous roads are likely to flood.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor the latest forecast and be alert for possible
Flood Warnings. Those living or commuting in areas prone to flooding
should be prepared to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
