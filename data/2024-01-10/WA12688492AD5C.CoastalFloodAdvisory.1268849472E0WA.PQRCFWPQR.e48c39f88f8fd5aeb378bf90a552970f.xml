...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM THIS

* IMPACTS...Minor flooding, up to one foot above ground level,
during high tides is expected in the low lying areas near bays,
sloughs, and the lower reaches of the coastal rivers.
Destructive waves may wash over beaches, jetties, and other
structures unexpectedly. People can be swept off rocks and
jetties and drown while observing high surf. Severe beach
erosion may destroy coastal properties and buildings. Higher
than normal water run-up is expected on beaches and low-lying
shoreline.</description>
<instruction>A Coastal Flood Advisory means that tidal overflow flooding is
expected. Coastal residents in the warned area should be alert
for rising water, and take appropriate action to protect life and
property.
A High Surf Warning means that high surf will affect beaches,
producing rip currents, sneaker waves and beach erosion. Stay
well back from the water`s edge and be alert for exceptionally
high waves.
Keep away from large logs on the beach. Water running up on the
beach can lift or roll logs which can injure or kill someone
caught in their path.</instruction>
