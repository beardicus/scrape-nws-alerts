<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 1230 PM EST THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Excessive rainfall causing slow onset flooding of several
streams, resulting isolated to scattered areas of lowland flooding.
* WHERE...portions of Rutherford County, North Carolina
* WHEN...Until 1230 PM EST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks,
greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and
parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.
A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1238 AM EST, High flows and out-of-bank conditions
continue along larger streams in Rutherford County from
earlier heavy rainfall, especially along the Second Broad and
Broad Rivers, resulting in isolated to scattered nuisance
flooding of adjacent low-lying areas from Spindale to Bostic
to Caroleen to Cliffside and Harris.  Therefore a Flood
Advisory will continue for the lower reaches of the Second
Broad and Broad Rivers until stream levels fall below
bankfull and the flood threat subsides.
