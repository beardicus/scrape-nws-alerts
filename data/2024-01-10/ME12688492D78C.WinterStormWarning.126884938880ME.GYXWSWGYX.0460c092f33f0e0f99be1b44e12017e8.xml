<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 10 at 6:47AM EST until January 10 at 11:00AM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 AM EST THIS
MORNING...
* WHAT...Heavy wet snow and sleet. Additional snow accumulations up
to one inch for a storm total of 6 to 15 inches and sleet
accumulations up to one tenth of an inch. Winds gusting as high as
55 mph.
* WHERE...Southern Somerset, Central Somerset, Northern Franklin,
Northern Oxford, and Southern Franklin Counties.
* WHEN...Until 11 AM EST this morning.
* IMPACTS...Significant snowfall with the potential for a foot plus
of snow will bring a period of impacts. Moderate snow with periods
of heavy snow will create hazardous travel conditions across the
region. Heavy wet snow will cause weighted tree limbs, leading to
snapped branches and downed trees. Widespread to numerous power
outages possible. Strong gusty winds are expected with the
snowstorm. The winds will combine with the dry snow to create
dangerous blowing and drifting of snow. Localized periods of near
zero visibility in open areas will lead to hazardous travel
conditions. Snow will change over to rain causing a period of
slushy roads that will lead to extremely slick conditions. Plan on
delaying travel to allow time for road conditions to improve. Snow
will change to a period of sleet. Visibilities and blowing snow
conditions will improve, but road conditions will remain extremely
slick due to the sleet. Avoid travel if possible. Even light
snowfall amounts can accumulate on roads and cause dangerous
driving conditions due to snow covered roads. The hazardous
conditions could impact the Wednesday morning commute. Strong
winds could cause extensive damage to trees and power lines.</description>

your vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road conditions can
