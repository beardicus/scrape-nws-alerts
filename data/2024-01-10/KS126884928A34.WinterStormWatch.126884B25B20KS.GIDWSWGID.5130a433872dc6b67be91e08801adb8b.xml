<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 10 at 3:49AM CST until January 12 at 12:00PM CST by NWS Hastings</headline>
<description>...MORE SNOW ON THE WAY, FOLLOWED BY SEVERAL DAYS OF BITTER COLD...
...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
FRIDAY MORNING...
...WIND CHILL ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT THURSDAY NIGHT TO
NOON CST FRIDAY...
...WIND CHILL WATCH IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY EVENING THROUGH TUESDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...For the Winter Storm Watch for Thursday afternoon into
Friday morning, heavy snow possible, along with blowing snow.
Total snow accumulations mainly between 3 and 7 inches possible,
accompanied by north winds gusting up to around 35 MPH. For the
Wind Chill Advisory for Thursday night into Friday morning, very
cold wind chills as low as 15 to 25 degrees below zero expected.
For the Wind Chill Watch for Friday evening through Tuesday
morning , dangerously cold wind chills as low as 25 to 40 degrees
below zero possible.
* WHERE...Portions of north central Kansas and central, east
central, and south central Nebraska.
* WHEN...For the Winter Storm Watch, from Thursday afternoon through
Friday morning. For the Wind Chill Advisory, from midnight
Thursday Night to noon CST Friday. For the Wind Chill Watch, from
Friday evening through next Tuesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous snowy
conditions could impact the Thursday evening and Friday morning
commutes. The dangerously cold wind chills could cause frostbite
on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Compared to the previous winter storm a few
days ago, this next winter storm for Thursday afternoon into
Friday morning currently carries a bit more uncertainty regarding
snow amounts and what areas are most favored to see the lower
versus higher range of snowfall possibilities. However, this will
be a drier, fluffier snow compared to the previous system, and
although wind speeds will not be as strong, blowing snow and
reduced visibility will likely be an issue. Finally, confidence is
very high in the dangerously cold wind chills between Thursday
night and next Tuesday.</description>
