<headline>Flood Advisory issued January 10 at 2:03AM EST until January 12 at 7:00AM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...The Flood Advisory is extended for the following rivers in North
Carolina...
French Broad River At Asheville affecting Buncombe County.
.A potent storm system produced 5-7 inches of rainfall across the
upper French Broad River watershed and 2-3.5 inches of rainfall
across the middle and lower French Broad River watershed from early
Tuesday morning through Tuesday evening.  This rainfall quickly
overwhelmed saturated soils and resulted in excessive runoff and
significant stream rises throughout the French Broad River valley.
This excessive flow is causing portions of the French Broad River
from Bent Creek downstream to Biltmore, Asheville, Woodfin, and
Marshall to exceed Action/Advisory Stage, causing common, nuisance
flooding of low-lying areas.
The French Broad River near Asheville crested at 9.27 feet at 6:30pm
on Tuesday and has fallen to around 8.0 feet as local flows from the
Swannanoa River and smaller tributaries have fallen well below
critical levels.  Due to very high flows upstream closer to Fletcher
and Blantyre, the river will very slowly fall below Action Stage
later on Thursday.  The Flood Advisory will remain in place until
the French Broad River falls below the Action/Advisory Stage of 6.5
feet.
...FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL FRIDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...French Broad River at Asheville.
* WHEN...Until Friday morning.
* IMPACTS...At 7.5 feet, Action stage flooding continues.  French
Broad River floodwaters continue to flood Woodfin Riverside Park,
the floodplain adjacent to Craggy Dam Reservoir, Carrier Park, and
French Broad River Park as well as other low-lying areas within
the flood plain.  Floodwaters may be approaching Amboy Rd. and
Lyman St.
At 8.0 feet, Action stage flooding continues.  The French Broad
River is beginning to flood low-lying areas near Pearson Bridge
Rd. and may be approaching industrial property.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1:00 AM EST Wednesday the stage was 8.0 feet and nearly
steady.
- The French Broad River near Asheville crested at 9.27 feet at
6:30pm on Tuesday.
- Forecast...The river is expected to fall to 2.7 feet Sunday
evening.
