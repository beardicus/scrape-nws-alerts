<headline>High Surf Advisory issued January 10 at 2:48AM PST until January 11 at 3:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 3 PM THIS AFTERNOON
TO 3 PM PST THURSDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM TO NOON PST
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 5
to 8 feet with local max sets to 9 feet. Dangerous rip
currents are likely. Surf highest on west-facing beaches. For
the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding expected.
* WHERE...Catalina and Santa Barbara Islands, Malibu Coast and
Los Angeles County Beaches.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, from 3 PM this afternoon to
3 PM PST Thursday. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 4 AM
to noon PST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely, around the time of
high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as
parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to
roads or structures is NOT expected. There is an increased
risk for ocean drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers and
surfers out to sea. Large breaking waves can cause injury,
wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats
near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Morning high tide Thursday is predicted
to be near 7.3 feet at around 820 AM.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
