<headline>High Surf Warning issued January 10 at 2:40AM PST until January 10 at 1:00PM PST by NWS Seattle</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM PST THIS
AFTERNOON...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 AM THIS
MORNING TO 1 PM PST THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking
waves around 20 feet in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood
Advisory, minor coastal flooding expected. Inundation of 2 feet
above ground level is possible along shorelines and low-lying
coastal areas around the time of high tide.
* WHERE...North Coast and Central Coast zones.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Warning, until 1 PM PST Wednesday.
For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 7 AM to 1 PM PST
Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Minor coastal flooding due to tidal overflow is
expected around high tide. This may lead to flooding of
parking lots, parks, and roads, with only isolated road
closures expected. Destructive breaking waves can sweep people
off jetties and docks, and into dangerous seas. People can be
swept off rocks, jetties, and logs and drown while observing
high surf. Life-threatening surf conditions and significant
beach erosion can be expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...High waves continuing through high tide
today and continuing onshore flow is enhancing the coastal
flooding threat.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inundation above ground level refers to the height above the Mean
Higher High Water (MHHW) level.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other waterside
infrastructure.</instruction>
