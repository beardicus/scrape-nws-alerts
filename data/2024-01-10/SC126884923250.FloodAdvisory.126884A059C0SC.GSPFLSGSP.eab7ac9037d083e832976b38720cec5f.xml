<headline>Flood Advisory issued January 10 at 2:24AM EST until January 10 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...The Flood Advisory continues for the following rivers in South
Carolina...
Saluda River above Old Easley Rd, 5 W Greenville affecting
Greenville and Pickens Counties.
.A potent storm system produced 3.5-4.5 inches of rainfall across
the upper Saluda River watershed from from early Tuesday morning
through Tuesday afternoon.  This rainfall quickly overwhelmed
saturated soils and resulted in excessive runoff and significant
stream rises for all forks of the Saluda River and associated
tributaries.  This excessive flow has caused portions of the upper
Saluda River to exceed bankfull or Action/Advisory Stage and crest
near Minor Flood Stage, causing common, nuisance flooding of
low-lying areas.
The floodwave peak is passing the Saluda River near Old Easley Rd
and the river crest is imminent around 9.9 feet.  The river will
begin a recession early Wednesday morning and fall below
Action/Advisory Stage early Wednesday night.
...FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...Saluda River above Old Easley Rd, 5 W Greenville.
* WHEN...Until this evening.
* IMPACTS...At 9.5 feet, Minor Flood Stage. Common, deeper flooding
of low-lying areas adjacent to the Saluda River is developing with
lesser impacts to vulnerable property.  More significant
floodwaters are beginning to impact low-lying areas downstream of
Saluda Dam, including the lowest elevation of residential yards
along Shop Ct, Covenant Dr, Riverview Dr, Riverview Cir, and Old
Easley Bridge Rd.  Floodwaters may be approaching River Rd near
Myers Ln.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1:45 AM EST Wednesday the stage was 9.8 feet and cresting.
- Forecast...The river is expected to fall to 3.9 feet early
Monday morning.
- Action/Advisory Stage is 8.0 feet.
