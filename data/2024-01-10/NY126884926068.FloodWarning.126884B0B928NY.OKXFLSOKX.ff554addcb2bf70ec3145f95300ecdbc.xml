Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.
Even 6 inches of fast-moving flood water can knock you off your feet

or drive through such swift water. If you come upon flood waters,
stop, turn around and go another way.
