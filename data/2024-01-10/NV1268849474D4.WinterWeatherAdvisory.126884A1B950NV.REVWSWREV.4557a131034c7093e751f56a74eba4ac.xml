<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 10 at 2:05PM PST until January 11 at 1:00AM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM PST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Snow. Snow accumulations between 2 and 4 inches, with up to
8 inches in elevations above 5000 feet. Locally heavier amounts
greater than 6 inches possible. Winds gusting 40-55 mph, with
gusts 60-75 mph in wind prone areas, including US-95 near Walker
Lake.
* WHERE...Mineral and Southern Lyon Counties.
* WHEN...Until 1 AM PST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions will impact the Wednesday evening commute. Strong winds
could cause damage to trees and power lines. Sudden reductions in
visibilities of less than a 1/4 mile with whiteout conditions
possible, including Highway 95.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Enhanced snow bands accompanying a cold front
will bring quick, heavy snowfall in a short period with locally
heavier amounts possible if these bands stall. With these bands
expected to pass through during the peak school/work commute time,
major travel disruptions are possible. Very cold temperatures
behind the front may lead to flash freezes on roadways and
prolonged hazardous travel conditions into the Thursday morning
commute.</description>

conditions for the state you are calling from can be obtained by
