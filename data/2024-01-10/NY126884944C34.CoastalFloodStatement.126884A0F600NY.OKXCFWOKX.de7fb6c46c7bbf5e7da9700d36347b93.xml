<description>...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM EST THIS
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY MORNING THROUGH
SATURDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Watch, potential for 2 to locally 3
ft of inundation above ground level in vulnerable areas near
the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...Southwest Suffolk, Southeast Suffolk and Southern
Nassau Counties.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Statement, until 11 PM EST this
evening. For the Coastal Flood Watch, from Saturday morning
through Saturday afternoon.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Potential for widespread moderate to
locally major flooding of vulnerable areas near the waterfront
and shoreline Saturday morning. Potential for 2 to locally 3 ft
of inundation above ground level in low lying, vulnerable
areas. This would result in numerous road closures and cause
widespread flooding of low lying property including parking
lots, parks, lawns and homes/businesses with basements near the
waterfront. Vehicles parked in vulnerable areas near the
waterfront would likely become flooded. Flooding will also
extend inland from the waterfront along tidal rivers and bays.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...For this evening, breaking waves of 10 to 15
ft along the oceanfront will result in beach flooding and
scattered dune erosion with this evening high tide. Overwashes
are not expected this evening. For Friday Night into Saturday,
large breaking waves of 12 to 16 ft along the oceanfront will
likely result in widespread dune erosion and damage to dune
structures. Scattered overwashes are likely, resulting in some
flooding of roadways and vulnerable structures behind protective
dunes. Isolated breaches or inundation of the barrier island is
possible where dune structures have been severely compromised by
previous storms.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Timing of windshift of southeasterly gales
to southwesterly gales in relation to the time of high tide
Saturday morning will be key to water level forecast. This will
be refined over the next 48 hours.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
