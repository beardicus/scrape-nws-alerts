<headline>Coastal Flood Statement issued January 10 at 3:51AM EST until January 10 at 7:00AM EST by NWS Tampa Bay</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 AM EST THURSDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 4
to 6 feet. For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip
currents expected. For the Coastal Flood Statement, isolated
minor coastal flooding expected.
* WHERE...Pinellas, Coastal Hillsborough, Coastal Manatee and
Coastal Sarasota Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 7 AM EST Thursday.
For the High Rip Current Risk, through Thursday morning. For
the Coastal Flood Warning, from 10 AM this morning to 7 AM EST
Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Some water on low lying roads and property. Worst
case scenario is for water levels up to 2 feet above ground
level. Some shoreline erosion will occur. Dangerous swimming
and surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.
A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in
the advisory area, producing localized beach erosion and
dangerous swimming conditions.
There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.</instruction>
