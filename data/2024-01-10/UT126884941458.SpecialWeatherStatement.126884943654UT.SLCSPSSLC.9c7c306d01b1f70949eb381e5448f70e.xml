<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WILL AFFECT NORTH CENTRAL BOX ELDER COUNTY...
At 1257 PM MST...A snow squall was along a line extending from 9
miles south of Juniper to 7 miles northeast of Park Valley...and
moving east at 50 mph.
Locations impacted include...
Snowville, Curlew Junction, and Standrod.
This includes the following highways...
Interstate 84 between mile markers 1 and 13.
Utah Route 30 between mile markers 67 and 90.
* winds in excess of 35 mph are possible with this squall.
* visibilities will drop quickly to less than a half mile in this
squall.
Rapid visibility reduction and potentially icy roads are likely to
produce hazardous driving conditions. Travel is not advised during
this snow squall. If you are traveling and encounter adverse winter
driving conditions, reduce speed and make sure headlights are on to
increase the visibility of your vehicle to those around you.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time when traveling.</description>
