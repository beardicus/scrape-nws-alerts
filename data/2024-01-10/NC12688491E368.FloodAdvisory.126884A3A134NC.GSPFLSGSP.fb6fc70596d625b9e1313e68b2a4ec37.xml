<headline>Flood Advisory issued January 10 at 12:22AM EST until January 11 at 4:49PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON EST TODAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall and high lake inflows
is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of western North Carolina, including the
following counties, Burke and Caldwell.
* WHEN...Until noon EST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of flood-prone low-lying areas
adjacent to the lake shore is developing with lesser impacts to
vulnerable property.  Lakes may be flooding yards, docks, and
lake-access areas with up to 1-2 feet of inundation.  Campgrounds
along the lake shoreline may experience floodwater inundation of
up to 1 foot.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1206 AM EST, Rainfall accumulations of 3-5 inches on
Tuesday over the headwaters of the Catawba River, Johns
River, and associated tributaries has caused high flows and
rising lake pool elevations along the upper Catawba River.
This has caused Lake Rhodhiss to exceed the full pool of
100.0 feet and the Action/Advisory Stage of 102.0 feet.
Lake Rhodhiss may approach 104.0 feet overnight tonight.
Between 103 and 104 feet, backwater effects may impact
several tributaries including Silver Creek and Lower Creek,
causing flooding of low-lying areas along the tributaries,
including at Antioch Rd.  River access points will be
flooded, including at Huffman Bridge Rd.  The Catawba River
Greenway near Morganton may be flooded as well.
The latest pool elevations for the upper Catawba River lakes
are as follows (Full Pool is 100.0 feet):
Lake James: 98.41 feet and rising slowly.
Lake Rhodhiss: 102.49 feet and rising steadily.
Lake Hickory: 98.93 feet and rising slowly.
Lookout Shoals Lake: 103.01 and rising steadily.
Forecast: Lake Rhodhiss is projected by Duke Energy to
possibly reach or exceed 104.0 feet Tuesday night as water is
moved through the Catawba River reservoir system.  No
additional rainfall will occur until Friday.  However, it
will take some time for Catawba River high flows to move
through the reservoir system.

projections, and dam releases from Duke Energy, please visit:

Valdese, Salem, Drexel, Connelly Springs, Rutherford College,
Glen Alpine, Rhodhiss, and Lake Rhodhiss.
