<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Stay away or be swept away! The banks of creeks and washes are
unstable and unsafe during any flooding event.
In hilly or mountainous terrain, there are many low water crossings
which will become dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross
flooded roads. Find an alternate route.
Remain alert for flooding even in locations not receiving rain.
Normally dry washes, slot canyons and creeks can become raging
killer currents in a matter of minutes, even from distant rainfall.</instruction>
