<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 2 AM TO 11 PM PDT WEDNESDAY
FOR DRY THUNDERSTORMS AND GUSTY OUTFLOW WINDS FOR FIRE WEATHER
ZONES 650, 651, AND 652...
The National Weather Service in Seattle has issued a Red Flag
Warning for dry thunderstorms and gusty outflow winds, which is
in effect from 2 AM to 11 PM PDT Wednesday.
* AFFECTED AREA...Fire Weather Zone 650 North Coastal Lowlands,
Fire Weather Zone 651 Central Coastal Lowlands and Fire
Weather Zone 652 West Portion of the Olympic Mountains.
* THUNDERSTORMS...Primary concern will be dry lightning strikes
over the affected areas.
* OUTFLOW WINDS...Gusty outflow winds possible in and around any
thunderstorms that develop.
* IMPACTS...Scattered lightning in dry fuels can cause multiple
fire starts. Thunderstorms can also bring sudden sharp wind
shifts on existing fires, causing rapid changes in a fire`s
rate of spread and direction of spread. Thunderstorm outflow
winds can be a threat for several hours following the start of
a new lightning-caused fire. If a fire were to begin, air
quality may diminish in the surrounding area.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either imminent or occurring now. Any fires that develop will
likely spread quickly. Outdoor burning is not recommended.</instruction>
