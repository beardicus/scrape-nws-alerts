* Impacts: Strong, gusty wind with low relative humidity and
critically dry vegetation will greatly increase the spread
potential of any new and existing fires. Lightning and high fire
danger will likely result in new fire starts. Gusty thunderstorm
winds could contribute to fire spread. Despite rainfall, initial
attack resources could be overwhelmed and holdover fires are
possible.

Alturas east along the Warners and the NW corner of the zone near
Newell.
In South Central OR Fire Zone....624. Today, the whole zone.
Wedensday, the southeast portion of the zone from Altamont east.
* Wind: Today, South 10 to 15 mph with gusts up to 25 mph. Winds
from thunderstorm outflows are likely to be erratic and 40+ mph.
Wednesday, 10 to 20 mph with gusts up to 30 mph.
* Thunderstorms: Scattered thunderstorms will continue into this
evening. storms will also become wetter today (up to half an
inch has been observed so far when multiple storms move over the
same location) and have a marginal risk (5%) of severe strength
hail or winds.
* Humidity: 9 to 13 percent.
