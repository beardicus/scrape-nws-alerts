FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONE 625...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH HAS BEEN CANCELLED FOR STRONG GUSTY WIND
WITH LOW RH AND ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE WEATHER
ZONE 625...
The National Weather Service in Medford has cancelled the Fire

new fire starts. Gusty thunderstorm winds could contribute to
fire spread. Despite rainfall, initial attack resources could be
overwhelmed and holdover fires are possible.

* Wind: South 10 to 15 mph with gusts up to 30 mph. Winds from
thunderstorm outflows are likely to be erratic and 40+ mph.
* Thunderstorms: Scattered thunderstorms will continue into this
evening. Storms will also become wetter today (up to half an inch
has been observed so far when multiple storms move over the same
location) and have a marginal risk (5%) of severe strength hail
or winds.

A Red Flag Warning does not mean there is a fire. It means that
critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now or will
shortly. These conditions promote rapid spread of fire which may
become life threatening. Evacuate if ordered to, or if a fire
threatens.
