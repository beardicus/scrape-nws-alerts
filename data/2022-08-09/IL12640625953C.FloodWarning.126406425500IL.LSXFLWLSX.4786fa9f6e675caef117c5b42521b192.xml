deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Rainfall heavier than forecast could cause river levels to rise even
higher than predicted. The National Weather Service will monitor
this developing situation and issue follow up statements as
conditions change.
