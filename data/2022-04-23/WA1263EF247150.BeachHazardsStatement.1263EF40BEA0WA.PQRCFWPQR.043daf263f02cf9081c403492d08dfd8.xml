* WHEN...From late tonight through Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...Sneaker waves can run up on the beach, lifting or

into the sea, do not swim in after them. Call 911, and keep an
eye on them until help arrives.

vigilant and aware of the ocean and surf. Always keep an eye
on the waves, and be especially watchful of children.</description>

potentially life-threatening conditions in the surf zone. Caution
should be used when in or near the water.
Remain out of the water to avoid hazardous swimming conditions.</instruction>
