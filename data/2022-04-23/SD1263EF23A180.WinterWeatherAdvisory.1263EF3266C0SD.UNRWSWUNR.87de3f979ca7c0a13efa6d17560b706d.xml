<description>...BLIZZARD TO IMPACT NORTHEAST WYOMING TO NORTHWEST SOUTH DAKOTA
THIS WEEKEND...
.An ongoing robust spring storm will bring heavy snow
accumulations and very strong winds this weekend to portions of
northeastern Wyoming and northwestern South Dakota, including the
northern Black Hills. Heavy snow of 10 to 18 inches is expected
across northeast Wyoming, along with northwest wind gusts over
60 mph. Heavy snow and wind gusts to 70 mph are expected across
northwest South Dakota. This will result in white out conditions
across these areas and the northern Foothills. The northern Black
Hills will see significant snowfall of up to 24 inches, with
locally higher amounts possible, but winds will be weaker than
across the surrounding plains. Very strong northwesterly winds and
light snow across portions of the South Dakota plains will result
in areas of reduced visibility through Saturday.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM MDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Snow. Additional snow accumulations of up to 4 inches.
Winds gusting as high as 70 mph.
* WHERE...The Southern Meade County Plains, the Northern Meade
County Plains, Ziebach County and the Pennington County
Plains. This includes the Tribal Lands of the Cheyenne River
Reservation.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM MDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. Very strong winds
could cause extensive tree damage.</description>
