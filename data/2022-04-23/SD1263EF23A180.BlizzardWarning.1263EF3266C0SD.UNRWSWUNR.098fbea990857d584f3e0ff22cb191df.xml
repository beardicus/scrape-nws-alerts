<description>...BLIZZARD TO IMPACT NORTHEAST WYOMING TO NORTHWEST SOUTH DAKOTA
THIS WEEKEND...
.An ongoing robust spring storm will bring heavy snow
accumulations and very strong winds this weekend to portions of
northeastern Wyoming and northwestern South Dakota, including the
northern Black Hills. Heavy snow of 10 to 18 inches is expected
across northeast Wyoming, along with northwest wind gusts over
60 mph. Heavy snow and wind gusts to 70 mph are expected across
northwest South Dakota. This will result in white out conditions
across these areas and the northern Foothills. The northern Black
Hills will see significant snowfall of up to 24 inches, with
locally higher amounts possible, but winds will be weaker than
across the surrounding plains. Very strong northwesterly winds and
light snow across portions of the South Dakota plains will result
in areas of reduced visibility through Saturday.
...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM MDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions. Additional snow accumulations of 5
to 13 inches. Winds gusting as high as 70 mph.
* WHERE...The Sturgis/Piedmont Foot Hills and the Northern Foot
Hills.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM MDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible.
Widespread blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility.
Very strong winds could cause extensive tree damage.</description>
<instruction>A Blizzard Warning means the combination of snow, blowing snow,
and strong winds will create dangerous whiteout conditions.
Road conditions are available on your smartphone from the
5 1 1 app for your state.</instruction>
