<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AKDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues to be possible.
* WHERE...The Yukon River at Tanana
* WHEN...Until 6 PM AKDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Ice jam flooding is possible at Tanana through this
evening. If an ice jam forms, water will rise very rapidly and
people may need to evacuate to higher ground at a moments notice.
Prepare your community now for flooding, and where possible, move
items to higher ground.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- High water levels are present in Tanana, with roughly 1 foot
of water over one of the lowest points of the road along the
river. The River Watch Team reports the breakup front moved
past Tanana Tuesday afternoon, with an approximately 120 mile
run of bank-to-bank ice chunks and pans. Bank-to-bank ice
continues to move downstream. In place ice sheets downriver
from Tanana are weakening, but there is still the possibility
of an ice jam forming. In addition, water levels will
continue rise and reach bankfull levels due to the high
volume of ice and water associated with the ice run moving
past the community.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
