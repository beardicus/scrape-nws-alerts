<description>...AREAS OF SMOKE IN CENTRAL AND NORTHEAST SOUTH DAKOTA THROUGH
THURSDAY MORNING...
Smoke, some of it dense at times, will reduce the visibility to
as low as a quarter mile across the region through tonight. This
smoke originates from Canada wildfires and will move from
northwest to southeast behind a cold front currently sweeping
through the state, and linger through tomorrow morning. Already,
reports have been streaming in of very poor visibility and a very
bad smell. The smoke is then expected to diminish throughout the
day tomorrow into the evening. Motorists should be prepared for
rapidly changing visibilities, and should use extra caution
traveling. Use low beam headlights and be extra cautious at
intersections and railroad crossings. People with a respiratory
condition should be prepared for very poor air quality over the
nest 12 to 24 hours.</description>
