<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH FRIDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues to be possible.
* WHERE...The Yukon River from Galena to Koyukuk
* WHEN...Through Friday morning.
* IMPACTS...Ice jam flooding is possible between Galena and Koyukuk
through Friday morning. If an ice jam forms, water will rise very
rapidly and people may need to evacuate to higher ground at a
moments notice. Prepare your community now for flooding, and where
possible, move items to higher ground.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Breakup continues to progress down the Yukon River, with an
estimated 150 mile heavy run of ice extending from Tanana to
the breakup front, which is upriver of Ruby as of Wednesday
evening. Given aerial ice assessments, breakup jams appear
unlikely but there is potential for high water and minor
flooding, particularly of low-lying areas from Galena to
Koyukuk as that ice moves through over the next few days.

If you live near or along the Yukon River between Galena and Koyukuk
stay alert and be prepared to take action.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
