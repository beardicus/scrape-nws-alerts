<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT FROM 10 PM CDT TONIGHT THROUGH 12 PM
CDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has issued an Air
Quality Alert for fine particle pollution. The Air Quality Index
(AQI) is expected to reach the Orange or Unhealthy for Sensitive
Groups category.
* WHERE...western Minnesota.
* WHEN...From 10 PM CDT tonight through 12 PM CDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease
(including asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults, may
experience health effects.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A band of very heavy ground-level smoke from
wildfires in northern Alberta and Saskatchewan is currently moving
southeast and stretches from southern Manitoba to eastern Montana. A
strong cold front will pull this smoke eastward into Minnesota.
Fine particle levels are expected to reach the orange AQI category, a
level considered unhealthy for sensitive groups, across west central
Minnesota. This area includes Ortonville. In the orange area,
sensitive groups should avoid prolonged time outdoors. Smoke may
linger across Minnesota beyond the expiration time and this air
quality alert may need to be extended.

<instruction>Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including
asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults, should limit
prolonged or heavy exertion.
Keep windows closed overnight to prevent smoke from getting indoors.
Reduce or eliminate activities that contribute to air pollution, such
as outdoor burning, and use of residential wood burning devices.
Reduce vehicle trips and vehicle idling as much as possible.</instruction>
