<headline>Flood Warning issued May 17 at 9:16PM CDT until May 23 at 1:00AM CDT by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in
Minnesota...
Cottonwood River Above Springfield affecting Brown County.
Cottonwood River at New Ulm affecting Brown County.
Minnesota River at New Ulm affecting Nicollet, Brown and Blue
Earth Counties.
...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in
Minnesota...
Minnesota River near Jordan affecting Sibley, Carver and Scott

Sueur Counties.
Minnesota River at Mankato affecting Nicollet and Blue Earth
Counties.
Minnesota River at Morton affecting Renville and Redwood Counties.
Minnesota River at Savage affecting Dakota, Carver, Hennepin and
Scott Counties.
.Swollen rivers continue due to rainfall over the weekend and last
week, with the gradual procession of flow down the Minnesota towards
the Mississippi River ongoing. We could end up with a few more
points in flood stage over the next few days, mainly downstream from
where the precipitation actually fell, and will be the main concern
for the forecast aside from the points already in flood stage. Some
light rainfall arrives tomorrow, but should not impact ongoing
flooding based on the amount and spread.
...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL EARLY TUESDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is occurring and moderate flooding is
forecast.
* WHERE...Minnesota River at Henderson MN19.
* WHEN...Until early Tuesday morning.

(estimated levels for spring flooding)
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 830 PM CDT Wednesday, the stage was 735.8 feet.
- Recent Activity...The maximum river stage in the 24 hours
ending at 830 PM CDT Wednesday was 735.8 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise to a crest of 736.3
feet early tomorrow afternoon. It will then fall below flood
stage Monday morning.
- Flood stage is 732.0 feet.
