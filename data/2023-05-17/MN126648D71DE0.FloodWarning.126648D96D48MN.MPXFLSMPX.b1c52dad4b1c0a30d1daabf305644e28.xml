<headline>Flood Warning issued May 17 at 9:16PM CDT until further notice by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in
Minnesota...
Cottonwood River Above Springfield affecting Brown County.
Cottonwood River at New Ulm affecting Brown County.
Minnesota River at New Ulm affecting Nicollet, Brown and Blue
Earth Counties.
...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in
Minnesota...
Minnesota River near Jordan affecting Sibley, Carver and Scott
Counties.
Minnesota River at Henderson MN19 affecting Sibley, Scott and Le
Sueur Counties.
Minnesota River at Mankato affecting Nicollet and Blue Earth
Counties.
Minnesota River at Morton affecting Renville and Redwood Counties.
Minnesota River at Savage affecting Dakota, Carver, Hennepin and
Scott Counties.
.Swollen rivers continue due to rainfall over the weekend and last
week, with the gradual procession of flow down the Minnesota towards
the Mississippi River ongoing. We could end up with a few more
points in flood stage over the next few days, mainly downstream from
where the precipitation actually fell, and will be the main concern
for the forecast aside from the points already in flood stage. Some
light rainfall arrives tomorrow, but should not impact ongoing
flooding based on the amount and spread.
...FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is occurring and minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Minnesota River at Savage.
* WHEN...Until further notice.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 900 PM CDT Wednesday, the stage was 704.7 feet.
- Recent Activity...The maximum river stage in the 24 hours
ending at 900 PM CDT Wednesday was 704.7 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise to a crest of 707.9
feet early Sunday afternoon.

708.1 feet on 05/06/1986.
