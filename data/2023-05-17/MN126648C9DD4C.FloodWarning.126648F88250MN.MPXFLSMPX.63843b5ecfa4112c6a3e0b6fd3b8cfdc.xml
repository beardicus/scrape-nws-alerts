<headline>Flood Warning issued May 17 at 10:31AM CDT until May 20 at 4:00PM CDT by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in
Minnesota...
Cottonwood River Above Springfield affecting Brown County.
Cottonwood River at New Ulm affecting Brown County.
Minnesota River at New Ulm affecting Brown, Nicollet and Blue
Earth Counties.
...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in

...The Flood Warning is cancelled for the following rivers in
Minnesota...
Minnesota River at Montevideo affecting Chippewa, Yellow Medicine
and Lac qui Parle Counties.
.Flooding continues for points along the Cottonwood River in
southwestern Minnesota as well as the main stem Minnesota River due
to the rainfall from last week and over the weekend. As the water
continues to move downstream, and barring any further significant
rainfall, we should see river levels steadily decrease over the next
couple of weeks. Some showers are possible along a cold front
tomorrow into Friday, however this should not cause any impacts to
current forecasts due to how quickly the showers move through and
the limited moisture to work with.
...FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL SATURDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is occurring and minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Minnesota River at Morton.
* WHEN...Until Saturday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...At 23.0 feet, Riverside Rd and Front Street flooded in
North Redwood.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1000 AM CDT Wednesday, the stage was 22.3 feet.
- Recent Activity...The maximum river stage in the 24 hours
ending at 1000 AM CDT Wednesday was 22.4 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise to a crest of 22.3
feet this afternoon. It will then fall below flood stage late
Friday evening.
- Flood stage is 21.0 feet.
