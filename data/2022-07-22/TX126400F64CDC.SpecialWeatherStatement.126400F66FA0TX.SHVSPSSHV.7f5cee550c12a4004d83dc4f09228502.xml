<instruction>If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.
Torrential rainfall is also occurring with these storms and may lead

roadways.
Frequent cloud to ground lightning is occurring with these storms.
Lightning can strike 10 miles away from a thunderstorm. Seek a safe
shelter inside a building or vehicle.
These storms may intensify, so be certain to monitor local radio
