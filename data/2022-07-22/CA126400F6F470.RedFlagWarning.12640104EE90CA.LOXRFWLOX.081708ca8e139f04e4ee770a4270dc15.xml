<headline>Red Flag Warning issued July 22 at 2:40PM PDT until July 23 at 6:00AM PDT by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM PDT SATURDAY FOR GUSTY
NORTHWEST WINDS AND VERY LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR THE LOS
ANGELES COUNTY MOUNTAINS FROM THE I-5 CORRIDOR TO LAKE HUGHES...
.A warm and very dry air mass will continue to impact interior
areas of southern California through tonight, which combined with
locally gusty northwest winds will lead to critical fire weather
conditions through tonight over the northern Los Angeles County
Mountains, mainly from the Interstate 5 Corridor to Lake Hughes.
While currently not in the Red Flag Warning area, other fire
weather concern areas through tonight include the Ventura county
mountains, Antelope Valley, and western portions of the Santa Ynez
mountains and adjacent foothills where brief critical fire
weather conditions are expected. If any new fire ignitions occur,
this environment will create extreme and dangerous fire behavior.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM PDT SATURDAY FOR
GUSTY NORTHWEST WINDS AND VERY LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR THE LOS
ANGELES COUNTY MOUNTAINS FROM THE I-5 CORRIDOR TO LAKE HUGHES...
* Winds...Northwest 15 to 30 mph with gusts to 40 mph. Isolated
gusts to 45 mph.
* Relative Humidity...6 to 12 percent. Poor overnight recoveries
12-20 percent.
* Impacts...If fire ignition occurs, conditions are favorable for
rapid fire spread and extreme fire behavior which would
threaten life and property.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now....or will shortly. A combination of
gusty winds, warm temperatures, very low relative humidity, and
very dry fuels can contribute to rapid fire spread and extreme
fire behavior. Use extreme caution with potential fire ignition
sources.</instruction>
