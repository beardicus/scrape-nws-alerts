<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON PDT WEDNESDAY FOR KLAMATH
AND LAKE COUNTIES...
The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality has issued an Air
Pollution Advisory...in effect until noon PDT Wednesday.
Wildfires burning in the region, particularly the Cedar Creek Fire in
the High Cascades near Oakridge and Highway 58, combined with
forecast weather conditions, will cause air quality levels to
fluctuate such that they`re likely to be at unhealthy levels, at
times, across Klamath and Lake counties.
More specifically, poor air quality north through east of Klamath
Falls this Monday afternoon is likely to be most hazardous to health
today through Tuesday morning, with the worst air quality forecast
to be across northern portions of Klamath and Lake counties. Tuesday
afternoon through Wednesday morning air quality is likely to be more
variable as some smoke arrives from the Mosquito Fire in California
during the day, followed by another round of smoke from the northwest
from the Cedar Creek Fire Tuesday night into Wednesday morning.
Members of sensitive groups may experience health effects. The
general public is not likely to be affected.
