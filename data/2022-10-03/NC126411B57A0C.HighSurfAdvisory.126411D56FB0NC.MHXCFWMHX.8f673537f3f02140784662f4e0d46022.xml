<headline>High Surf Advisory issued October 03 at 9:55AM EDT until October 05 at 7:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EDT
WEDNESDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EDT
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, 2 to 4 feet of
inundation above ground level expected in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways. For the High Surf Advisory,
large breaking waves of 7 to 10 feet expected in the surf
zone. For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents
and large breaking waves expected in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Northern Outer Banks and Hatteras Island (soundside
and oceanside).
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, from noon Monday to 7 PM
EDT Wednesday. For the High Surf Advisory, from 8 AM Monday to
7 PM EDT Wednesday. For the Beach Hazards Statement, from
Monday morning through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...Up to 2 to 4 feet of inundation above ground level
is possible in some ocean and soundside areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways resulting in a threat to life and
property. Significant flooding will extend inland from the
waterfront causing flooding of some homes and businesses. Some
roads will be impassable at times, including portions of
Highway 12, especially around the times of high tide for
several high tide cycles. Large 7 to 10 foot breaking surf
will create dangerous swimming and surfing conditions,
localized beach erosion, and ocean overwash. Rip currents can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper
water. Dangerous shore break can throw a swimmer or surfer
head first into the bottom causing neck and back injuries.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most likely time for strong rip
currents to occur is a couple hours either side of low tide,
which will occur around 7:30 AM this morning.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
