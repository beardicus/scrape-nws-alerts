<description>...Strong Storm Moving to the Eastern Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea
Wednesday Through Friday...
A strong storm will develop in the Sea of Ohkotsk tonight and
move to Chukotsk Peninsula Wednesday, then to Wrangel Island by
Thursday morning. The storm will continue northeast into the
Arctic Ocean on Friday.
Strong southerly to southwesterly winds are expected to accompany
this storm moving into the Eastern Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea
Wednesday afternoon and evening with the weather front moving to
the coast early Thursday morning. Behind the front winds will turn
more westerly.
This storm will bring a high surf and and erosion to south and
west facing shores from the Bering Strait to Norton Sound
Wednesday night through Friday. In addition, elevated water
levels may bring the risk of minor coastal flooding in low lying
areas in the same area and also at Deering on the northern Seward
Peninsula.
There is a higher threat of coastal flooding and significant
erosion from the Bering Strait north to Utqiagvik and Coastal
Flood Watches have been issued for this area.
