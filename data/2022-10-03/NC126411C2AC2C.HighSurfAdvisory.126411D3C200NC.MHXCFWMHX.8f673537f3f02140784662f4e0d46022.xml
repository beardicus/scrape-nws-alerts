<headline>High Surf Advisory issued October 03 at 8:03PM EDT until October 05 at 8:00AM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH TUESDAY
EVENING NORTH OF CAPE HATTERAS...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT
TUESDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM EDT
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, 2 to 3 feet of inundation
above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 7
to 10 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards Statement,
dangerous rip currents, large breaking waves, and strong
longshore currents in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Northern Outer Banks and Hatteras Island.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, until 8 PM EDT Tuesday.
For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 AM EDT Wednesday. For the
Beach Hazards Statement, through Tuesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Up to 2 to 3 feet of inundation above ground level
remains possible in some ocean and soundside areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways resulting in a threat to life and
property. Significant flooding will extend inland from the
waterfront causing flooding of some homes and businesses. Some
roads will be impassable at times, including portions of Highway
12, especially around the times of high tide for at least a
couple more high tide cycles. Dangerous swimming and surfing
conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep
even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
Dangerous shore break can throw a swimmer or surfer head first
into the bottom causing neck and back injuries. Strong longshore
currents will create dangerous swimming conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most likely time for strong rip
currents to occur is a couple hours either side of low tide,
which will occur around 9:00 AM Tuesday.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
