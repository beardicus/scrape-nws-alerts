<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 PM EDT TUESDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT TUESDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH TUESDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, one to two feet of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking
waves of 8 to 12 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards
Statement, a high risk for rip currents.
* WHERE...Eastern Currituck County, including the Northern Outer
Banks.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, until 2 PM EDT Tuesday.
For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT Tuesday. For the
Beach Hazards Statement, through Tuesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Widespread flooding of vulnerable areas will result in
an elevated threat of property damage to homes and businesses
near the waterfront and shoreline. Water will be 1 to 2 feet
above ground level in some areas resulting in a sufficient depth
to close numerous roads and threaten homes and businesses.
Flooding will extend inland from the waterfront along tidal
rivers and bays resulting in some road closures and flooding of
vehicles. Large breaking surf will create dangerous swimming and
surfing conditions, beach erosion, and ocean overwash.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
