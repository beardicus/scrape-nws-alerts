<description>...AIR QUALITY HEALTH ADVISORY FOR WILDFIRE SMOKE FROM 800 AM
THURSDAY UNTIL 900 AM FRIDAY...
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has
issued the following...
WHAT...Air Quality Health Advisory for Wildfire Smoke.
WHERE...southern Garfield and northern Mesa Counties. Locations
include, but are not limited to, Parachute and De Beque.
WHEN...800 AM Thursday June 29 to 900 AM Friday June 30
IMPACTS...Dry and windy conditions are expected to continue on
Thursday and may once again intensify behavior of the Spring Creek
wildfire. On Thursday afternoon and evening, smoke will mainly be
transported to areas east and northeast of the fire with brief
periods of moderate to heavy smoke possible in Rulison, Rifle,
Antlers and Silt. However, heavier smoke will be possible late
Thursday night through early Friday morning as the smoke drains to
lower elevations. The heaviest smoke impacts early Friday morning
will be most likely along the Interstate 70 corridor between
Parachute and De Beque.
HEALTH INFORMATION...Public Health Recommendations: If smoke is
thick or becomes thick in your neighborhood you may want to remain
indoors. This is especially true for those with heart disease,
respiratory illnesses, the very young, and the elderly. Consider
limiting outdoor activity when moderate to heavy smoke is present.
Consider relocating temporarily if smoke is present indoors and is
making you ill. If visibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in
your neighborhood, smoke has reached levels that are unhealthy.</description>
