<description>...Air Quality Alert for Thursday June 29th and Friday June 30th...
The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy
has declared Thursday June 29th and Friday June 30th to be Action
Days for elevated levels of fine particulate and ozone. Air quality
is expected to range from the Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups to
Unhealthy level with some hourly concentrations in the Very Unhealthy
range.
The Action Day is in effect for the following Michigan counties...
Muskegon, Ottawa, Kent, Allegan, and Van Buren.
Smoke originating from wildfires in Canada is currently impacting
PM2.5 and ozone concentrations at the surface and will continue
through Friday June 30th.
Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including
asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults, should limit
prolonged and heavy exertion.
Reduce or eliminate activities that contribute to air pollution, such
as outdoor burning, and use of residential wood burning devices.
Reduce vehicle trips and vehicle idling as much as possible.
Keep windows closed overnight to keep smoke from getting indoors and,
if possible, run central air conditioning with MERV-13 or higher rated
filters.
