especially susceptible to winds of this magnitude and may be
overturned. For your protection move to an interior room on the
lowest floor of a building. These storms have the potential to cause
serious injury and significant property damage.
Continuous cloud to ground lightning is occurring with these storms.

flash flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flooded roadways.</instruction>
