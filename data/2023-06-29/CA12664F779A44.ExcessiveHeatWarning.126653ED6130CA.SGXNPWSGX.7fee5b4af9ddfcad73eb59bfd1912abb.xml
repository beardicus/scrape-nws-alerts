PDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Dangerously hot conditions with afternoon high
temperatures of 112 to 117 degrees expected.
* WHERE...Coachella Valley, San Diego County Deserts and San
Gorgonio Pass Near Banning.
* WHEN...From 11 AM Saturday to 8 PM PDT Monday.

<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances. This is especially true during warm or
hot weather when car interiors can reach lethal temperatures in a
matter of minutes.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible, reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear light weight and loose fitting clothing when
possible and drink plenty of water.</instruction>
