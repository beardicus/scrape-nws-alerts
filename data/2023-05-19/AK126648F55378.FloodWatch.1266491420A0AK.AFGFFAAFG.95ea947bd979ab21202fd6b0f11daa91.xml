<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues to be possible.
* WHERE...For the Yukon River, from the mouth of the Nowitna River
to Nulato, including Galena and Koyukuk
* WHEN...Through Sunday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of low lying areas along the Yukon River is now
occurring near the Nowitna River area behind a large ice jam.
Flooding of low lying areas is expected to move downstream
sometime between tonight and Sunday when the ice jam lets loose.
Water could rise very rapidly as a surge of water and ice moves
downstream. Ice could move onshore near the river bank. Flooding
is possible at Galena and Koyukuk sometime between late tonight
through Sunday. Fish camps and cabins along the Yukon River from
the mouth of the Nowitna River to Nulato could become flooded and
sea damage from ice. Ruby and Nulato are not expected to flood due
to their elevation above the river.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- On Friday afternoon, an ice jam remains in place on the Yukon
River 20 miles upstream of Ruby. The ice jam is about 40
miles long with ice tightly packed together. Extensive
flooding has now formed a large lake along and upstream of
the ice jam. The ice is now getting wet and weakening under
the sun, and the jam is expected to let loose sometime
between tonight and Sunday. When the jam releases, a surge of
high water and ice will move rapidly downriver and could
flood many low areas near the river and push ice up over the
bank, including at Galena and Koyukuk. It is estimated that
when the jam breaks it will take 6 to 8 hours for the high
water to reach Galena, and another 3 to 4 hours for the high
water to reach Koyukuk. This means high water could reach
Galena sometime between late tonight and Sunday.

- If you live near or along the Yukon River between the Nowitna
and Koyukuk Rivers stay alert and be prepared to take action.</description>
<instruction>Those living in areas prone to flooding should prepare now for
possible ice jam flooding. Move valuables to higher ground and
prepare to evacuate on short notice. If flooding develops, water
will rise very fast.</instruction>
