<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT CDT TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Small stream flooding caused by excessive rainfall
continues.
* WHERE...A portion of south central Texas, including the following
county, Llano.
* WHEN...Until midnight CDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
Rises in small streams and normally dry arroyos. Dangerous flows
over low-water crossings.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 832 PM CDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms. This will cause small stream flooding. Between
1 and 3 inches of rain have fallen, with highest amounts
indicated over the San Fernando Creek Basin between Castell
and Valley Spring.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are expected
over the area. This additional rain will likely result in
minor flooding, and there is a chance that a flash flood
warning will be needed if enough rain falls before 10 pm.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Llano, Castell, Valley Spring, Baby Head and Field Creek.
