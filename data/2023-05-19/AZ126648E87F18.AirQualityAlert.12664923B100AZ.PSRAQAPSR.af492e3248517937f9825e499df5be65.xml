<description>...OZONE HIGH POLLUTION ADVISORY FOR PINAL COUNTY SUNDAY AND MONDAY...
The Pinal County Department of Air Quality has issued an Ozone High
Pollution Advisory for Pinal County including Apache Junction, Casa
Grande, Coolidge, and Florence on Sunday and Monday.
This means that forecast weather conditions combined with existing
ozone levels are expected to result in local maximum 8-hour ozone
concentrations that pose a health risk. Adverse health effects
increase as air quality deteriorates.
Ozone is an air contaminant which can cause breathing difficulties
for children, older adults, as well as persons with respiratory
problems. A decrease in physical activity is recommended.
You are urged to car pool, telecommute or use mass transit.
The use of gasoline-powered equipment should be reduced or done late
in the day.
