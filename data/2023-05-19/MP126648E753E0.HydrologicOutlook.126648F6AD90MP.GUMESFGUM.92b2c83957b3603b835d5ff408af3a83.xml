<headline>Hydrologic Outlook issued May 19 at 6:40PM ChST  by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL POSSIBLE MONDAY THROUGH wednesday...
This Hydrologic Outlook is for Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan in
the Mariana Islands.
A tropical disturbance continues to slowly develop well south-
southeast of Guam/southwest of Chuuk. This system is forecast to
continue to organize over the next 12 to 36 hours, eventually
turning north-northwest toward Guam. We have high confidence that
a significant tropical cyclone will move through the Marianas in
the coming week. What track it`ll take and at what strength
remains to be seen, as model variability is high right now.
Regardless of strength and track, a very high likelihood for heavy
rainfall exists.
Timing: Monday through Wednesday
Locations: All of the Mariana Islands
Amounts: At least 5 to 9 inches of rainfall.
Note: All locations may see locally higher rainfall totals.
Urban and small stream flooding is possible early next week as the
system moves through the region.
Closely monitor this developing situation in the event watches,
advisories, or warnings are needed. Forecasts will change in the
coming days as this situation evolves.
Ensure nearby storm drains are not clogged, especially for low-
lying or flood-prone areas.</description>
