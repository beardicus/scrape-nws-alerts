<description>...UNSEASONABLE HEAT THIS WEEKEND WITH FLOODING CONCERNS ACROSS
AREA WATERWAYS DUE TO EXCESSIVE SNOWMELT AND RUNOFF...
...THUNDERSTORM CHANCES INCREASING THROUGH THE WEEKEND...
Heat:
* Highs will warm 15-20 degrees above average this weekend,
similar to typical readings during late June. This translates to
around 90 degrees across western Nevada valleys and mid to upper
70s for Sierra valleys. The warmest days are most likely on
today and Saturday, with record highs possible and potential
for moderate heat risks to sensitive individuals in warmer
western Nevada valleys.
Snowmelt and River Rises:
* Increasing heat will continue accelerating snowmelt this week.
If planning outdoor recreation, avoid streams and rivers as they
will flow fast, cold, and high. While it may seem like a good
idea to jump into the rivers to cool off, the water is extremely
cold and shock can quickly set in, causing loss of motor
function. There are also likely to be snow bridges present in
the backcountry with water flowing beneath. Use extreme caution.
* The latest forecasts indicate the East and West Forks and
mainstem Walker River reaching minor flood stages through the
weekend. The West Fork of the Carson is expected to remain in
minor flood stage while the East Fork of the Carson River could
reach minor flood stage late Friday night. For more detailed
river forecasts, visit www.cnrfc.noaa.gov.
Shower and Thunderstorm Chances:
* Shower and thunderstorm chances will increase each day this
weekend with a 15-20% chance this afternoon and evening,
increasing up to 30% on Saturday, and up to 40% on Sunday. Gusty
outflow winds of 40-50 mph, small hail, and localized heavy
rainfall will be possible in the vicinity of any thunderstorms.</description>
