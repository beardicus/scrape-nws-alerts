<headline>High Surf Advisory issued May 11 at 7:47PM EDT until May 12 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM EDT
THURSDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THURSDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, 2 to 4 feet of inundation
above ground level expected near vulnerable dune structures. For
the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 8 to 11 feet in
the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip
currents, large breaking waves expected, and strong longshore
currents in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Oceanside Outer Banks, north of Cape Hatteras, and
soundside south of Buxton.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, until 6 AM EDT Thursday.
For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT Thursday. For the
Beach Hazards Statement, until 8 PM EDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Up to 2 to 4 feet of inundation above ground level
is expected for beach-adjacent properties and roadways,
resulting in a significant threat to life and property.
Numerous roads may be closed, including several sections of NC
12 on Hatteras Island. Low lying property including homes,
businesses, and some critical infrastructure will be
inundated. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
shoreline erosion will occur. Rip currents can sweep even the
best swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Dangerous
shore break can throw a swimmer or surfer head first into the
bottom causing neck and back injuries. Strong longshore
currents will create dangerous swimming conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Conditions will remain the same, then
gradually improve through the day Thursday. The greatest threat
of ocean overwash and inundation will occur around the times of
high tide. Dune erosion will be progressive and overwash will
likely be worse with each successive high tide. High tide will
be around 430 PM Wednesday afternoon and again around 500 AM
Thursday morning. NC DOT is reporting that NC-12 between Oregon
Inlet and Rodanthe will remain closed through at least Thursday
morning.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
