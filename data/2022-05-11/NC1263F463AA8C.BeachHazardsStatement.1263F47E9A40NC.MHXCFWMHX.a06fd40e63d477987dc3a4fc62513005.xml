<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued May 11 at 7:47PM EDT until May 12 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM EDT
THURSDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT NORTH OF CAPE LOOKOUT
THROUGH THURSDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, 1 to 3 feet of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways. For the Beach Hazards
Statement, dangerous rip currents and large breaking waves
expected.
* WHERE...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, areas along the
southern Pamlico Sound, lower Neuse River, and adjacent tidal
creeks. For the Beach Hazards Statement, oceanside Ocracoke
Island and Core Banks north of Cape Lookout.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 6 AM EDT
Thursday. For the Beach Hazards Statement, through this
evening.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only isolated
road closures expected. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Strong longshore currents
will create dangerous swimming conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most likely time for strong rip
currents to occur is a couple hours either side of low tide,
which will occur around 10:00 AM Thursday.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
