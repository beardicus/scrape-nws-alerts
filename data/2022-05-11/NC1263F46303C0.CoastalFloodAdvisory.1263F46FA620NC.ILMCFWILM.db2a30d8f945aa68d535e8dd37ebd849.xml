<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued May 11 at 3:20PM EDT until May 11 at 10:00PM EDT by NWS Wilmington</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Up to one half foot of inundation above ground level
expected in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways.
* WHERE...The lower Cape Fear River including downtown
Wilmington.
* WHEN...Until 10 PM EDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Low-lying roads and locations along the Intracoastal
Waterway and adjacent tidal creeks may observe minor coastal
flooding. Check with local officials for any road closures or
impacts. Longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers
into rip currents, piers, jetties, and other hazardous areas.
It may sweep swimmers off their feet, making it difficult to
return to shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Affected areas listed are based on
average tide conditions. Additional locations may experience
flooding during periods of heavy rainfall, high winds, or
other factors.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
