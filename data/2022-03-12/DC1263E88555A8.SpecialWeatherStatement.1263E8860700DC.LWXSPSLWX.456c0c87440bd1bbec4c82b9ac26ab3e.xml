<description>...RAPIDLY DETERIORATING CONDITIONS THIS MORNING...
Rain will change to snow over the Washington and Baltimore
Metropolitan areas as well as northeastern Maryland by 9 AM this
morning from northwest to southeast. Snowfall rates around one to
two inches per hour are expected through late this morning along
with rapidly falling temperatures below freezing. Despite the
recent warm conditions, snow is expected to stick on many
surfaces, causing travel disruptions.
Strong northwest winds with gusts around 45 to 55 mph are expected
during this time, causing snow and possible blowing snow to reduce
visibility below one-half mile at times. Near blizzard conditions
are expected.
Please use extra caution if you have to travel.</description>
