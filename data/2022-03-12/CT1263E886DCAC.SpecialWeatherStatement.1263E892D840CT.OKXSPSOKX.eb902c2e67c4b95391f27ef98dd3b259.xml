<description>...MODERATE SNOWFALL POSSIBLE EARLY THIS EVENING...
A band of moderate snow will move into the area between 500 PM
and 530 PM. Visibilities may be quickly reduced to 1/2 to 1 mile
as gusty northwest winds continue. An additional 1/2 to 1 inch of
snowfall is possible before the snow tapers off and ends early
this evening. Wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph are likely into tonight,
and a Wind Advisory remains in effect until 400 AM EDT.
Temperatures around freezing continue to fall this evening and
overnight, with lows 17 to around 20 degrees overnight. Gusty
northwest wind will produce wind chill values of 10 to 15 this
evening and as low as around 5 above zero overnight.
Motorists should exercise extra caution as snow develops and be
prepared for rapid changes in visibility. Also, untreated surfaces
may become slippery this evening as temperatures continue to
fall.</description>
