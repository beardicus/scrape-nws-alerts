<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued March 12 at 10:23AM EST until March 12 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EST THIS
EVENING ABOVE 3500 FEET...
* WHAT...Snow. Additional snow accumulations of up to an inch.
Winds gusting gusting as high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...Transylvania County.
* WHEN...Until 7 PM EST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Patches of black ice
will develop on bridges and overpasses, resulting in slippery
spots. The cold wind chills below zero could result in
hypothermia if precautions are not taken.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow showers will continue until early
afternoon and then snow will taper off through late day.
Temperatures across the mountains will remain below freezing
through the day, so black ice is possible. Winds will be strong
enough to knock down a few tree limbs and power lines.</description>
