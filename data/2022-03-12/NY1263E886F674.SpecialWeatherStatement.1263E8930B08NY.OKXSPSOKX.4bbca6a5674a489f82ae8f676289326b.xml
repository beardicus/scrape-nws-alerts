<description>...LIGHT TO MODERATE SNOWFALL THIS EVENING...
A band of light to moderate snow will move into the area between
515 PM and 545 PM. Visibilities may be quickly reduced to 1/2 to
1 mile as gusty northwest winds continue. An additional 1/2 and
possibly up to 1 inch of snowfall is possible before the snow
tapers off and ends this evening. Wind gusts up to 55 mph are
possible with the onset of the snow, with wind gusts of 45 to 50
mph likely into tonight. A Wind Advisory remains in effect until
400 AM EDT.
Temperatures in the lower to mid 30s will fall into the mid 20s
this evening, with overnight lows 17 to around 20 degrees. Gusty
northwest wind will produce wind chill values of 10 to 15 this
evening and as low as around 5 above zero overnight.
Motorists should exercise extra caution as snow develops and be
prepared for rapid changes in visibility. Also, untreated surfaces
may become slippery this evening as temperatures continue to
fall to below freezing.</description>
