<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 12 at 7:25AM EST until March 13 at 1:00AM EST by NWS Baltimore/Washington</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM EST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 4 to 8
inches. Northwest winds will gust around 45 to 55 mph,
especially this afternoon into tonight.
* WHERE...Locations along and west of the Allegheny Front in
Maryland and West Virginia as well as western Highland County
in Virginia.
* WHEN...Until 1 AM EST Sunday. Snow will be heaviest through 9
AM this morning. Snow will become lighter late this morning
into early this afternoon. However, another round of snow
showers and snow squalls are expected from mid-afternoon
through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. Gusty winds could
bring down tree branches. The cold wind chills as low as 20
below zero could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little
as 30 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The combination of snow and blowing snow
may reduce visibility below one-quarter mile at times. Near
blizzard conditions are possible.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
When venturing outside, watch your first few steps taken on
steps, sidewalks, and driveways, which could be icy and slippery,
increasing your risk of a fall and injury.</instruction>
