<headline>Hydrologic Outlook issued March 12 at 12:04PM PST  by NWS Pendleton</headline>
<description>...RISING RIVERS EARLY THIS WEEK DUE TO SEVERAL ROUNDS OF RAIN AND
RISING SNOW LEVELS...
For the east slopes of the Washington Cascades.
A series of storm systems will bring mountain snow through Sunday,
followed by rising snow levels and moderate rainfall Monday into
Tuesday.
The combination of accumulating mountain snow with subsequent snow
level rises and rainfall potential, will yield increasing runoff.
Moderate rains coupled with melting snow Monday into Tuesday will
result in rises to area creeks, streams, and rivers. Some area
rivers are expected to reach bankfull, cresting near flood stage
Tuesday into Wednesday.
While river flooding is not currently forecast, at lot will depend
on how much mountain snow accumulates, and how much rain on snow
occurs early this week. We will continue to monitor conditions and
update this outlook as the situation evolves.
For the latest river information and forecasts from the National
Weather Service go to weather.gov/Pendleton.</description>
