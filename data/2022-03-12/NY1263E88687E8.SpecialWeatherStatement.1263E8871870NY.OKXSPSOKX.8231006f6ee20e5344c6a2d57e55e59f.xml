<description>...MODERATE TO BRIEFLY HEAVY SNOW POSSIBLE THIS AFTERNOON...
A band of moderate to briefly heavy snow will move into Orange
County between 245 PM and 315 PM. Visibilities may be quickly
reduced to 1/2 mile or less at times as gusty northwest winds
continue. An additional 1 to 2 inches of snowfall is possible
before the snow tapers off and ends late this afternoon into early
this evening. A Winter Storm Warning remains in effect until 700
PM EST. Wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph are likely this afternoon into
tonight, and a Wind Advisory remains in effect until 400 AM EDT.
Temperatures in the upper 20s continue to fall, and will be around
20 degrees by early this evening, and reach lows around 15
overnight. Gusty northwest wind will produce wind chill values in
the single digits through this evening, and as low as zero to 5
below zero at times overnight.
Motorists should exercise extra caution as snow develops and be
prepared for rapid changes in visibility. Also, untreated surfaces
may become slippery this afternoon and this evening as
temperatures continue to fall.</description>
