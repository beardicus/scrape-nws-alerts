<headline>Special Weather Statement issued March 12 at 3:52PM EST  by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...MODERATE SNOWFALL POSSIBLE THIS AFTERNOON...
A band of moderate snow will move into the area between 400 PM
and 430 PM. Visibilities may be quickly reduced to 1/2 mile as
gusty northwest winds continue. Up to an additional inch of
snowfall is possible before the snow tapers off and ends early
this evening. Wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph are likely into tonight,
and a Wind Advisory remains in effect until 400 AM EDT.
Temperatures in the lower 30s continue to fall, and will be in
the mid 20s by early this evening, and reach lows around 20
degrees overnight. Gusty northwest wind will produce wind chill
values of 10 to 15 this evening and as low as 2 to 5 above zero
overnight.
Motorists should exercise extra caution as snow develops and be
prepared for rapid changes in visibility. Also, untreated surfaces
may become slippery this afternoon and this evening as
temperatures continue to fall.</description>
