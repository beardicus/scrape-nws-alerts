<headline>High Wind Warning issued October 24 at 3:34PM CDT until October 24 at 8:00PM CDT by NWS Midland-Odessa</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM CDT THIS
EVENING...
...FREEZE WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM TO 9 AM CDT TUESDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Wind Warning, west winds 35 to 45 mph with
gusts up to 65 mph. For the Freeze Warning, sub-freezing
temperatures as low as 28 expected.
* WHERE...Chinati and Davis Mountains.
* WHEN...For the High Wind Warning, until 8 PM CDT this evening.
For the Freeze Warning, from 4 AM to 9 AM CDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Winds will be particularly hazardous at higher
elevations where the strongest winds are likely to occur. Be
especially careful driving in these mountainous areas. Frost and
freeze conditions could kill crops, other sensitive vegetation
and possibly damage unprotected outdoor plumbing.</description>
<instruction>People should avoid being outside in forested areas and around
trees and branches. If possible, remain in the lower levels of
your home during the windstorm, and avoid windows. Use caution if
you must drive.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
