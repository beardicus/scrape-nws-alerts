<headline>Freeze Watch issued October 24 at 3:16AM CDT until October 25 at 9:00AM CDT by NWS Midland-Odessa</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM THIS AFTERNOON
TO 8 PM CDT THIS EVENING...
...FREEZE WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH
TUESDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...For the High Wind Warning, west winds 35 to 45 mph with
gusts up to 60 to 65 mph are expected. For the Freeze Watch,
sub- freezing temperatures as low as 29 degrees are possible.
* WHERE...Chinati and Davis Mountains.
* WHEN...For the High Wind Warning, from 1 PM to 8 PM CDT today.
For the Freeze Watch, from late tonight through Tuesday
morning.
* IMPACTS...Winds will be particularly hazardous at higher
elevations where the strongest winds are likely to occur. Be
especially careful driving in these mountainous areas. Frost and
freeze conditions could kill crops, other sensitive vegetation
and possibly damage unprotected outdoor plumbing.</description>
<instruction>People should avoid being outside in forested areas and around
trees and branches. If possible, remain in the lower levels of
your home during the windstorm, and avoid windows. Use caution if
you must drive.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
