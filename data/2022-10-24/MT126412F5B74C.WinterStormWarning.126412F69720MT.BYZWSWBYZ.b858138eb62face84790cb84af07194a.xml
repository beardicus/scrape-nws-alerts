<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued October 24 at 6:27AM MDT until October 24 at 12:00PM MDT by NWS Billings</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON MDT TODAY...
* WHAT...Snow occurring. Additional snow accumulations up to one
inch. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Southern Rosebud.
* WHEN...Until Noon MDT today.
* IMPACTS...Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will
likely become slick and hazardous. The strong winds and weight of
snow on tree limbs may down power lines and could cause sporadic
power outages. Whiteout conditions are expected and will make
travel treacherous and potentially life-threatening. Plan on
slippery road conditions. The hazardous conditions could impact
the morning commute. Gusty winds could bring down tree branches.</description>
<instruction>Persons should consider delaying all travel. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution. Consider taking a winter
storm kit along with you, including such items as tire chains,
booster cables, flashlight, shovel, blankets and extra clothing.
Also take water, a first aid kit, and anything else that would help
you survive in case you become stranded.</instruction>
