<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued October 24 at 10:43PM PDT until October 25 at 2:45AM PDT by NWS Seattle</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Seattle has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
North Central King County in west central Washington...
* Until 245 AM PDT.
* At 1043 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing
heavy rain across the warned area. Between 0.2 and 0.3 inches of
rain has fallen. The expected rainfall rate is 0.25 to 0.5 inches
in 1 hour. Flash flooding is possible.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow.
The debris flow can consist of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose
materials.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban
areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as
other poor drainage and low-lying areas.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
mainly rural areas of North Central King County
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
EXPECTED RAINFALL RATE...0.25-0.5 INCHES IN 1 HOUR</description>
<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
