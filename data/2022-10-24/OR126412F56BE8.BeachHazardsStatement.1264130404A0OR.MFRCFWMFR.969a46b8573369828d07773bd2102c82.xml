<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM PDT THIS AFTERNOON
THROUGH 11 PM PDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Moderate risk of sneaker waves expected. These are
waves that have an unusually higher run up on beaches when
compared to other observed waves.
* WHERE...Beaches along the Southern Oregon Coast, including the
beaches of Douglas, Coos, and Curry counties.
* WHEN...From 2 PM PDT this afternoon through 11 PM PDT this
evening.
* IMPACTS...Even during calm conditions, sneaker waves can sweep
up the beach without warning and knock unsuspecting people
over and pull them out to sea. Shock and hypothermia can occur
quickly in the cold Pacific waters. In addition, logs and
other debris can be lifted and carried by the waves, crushing
or entrapping unsuspecting victims underneath.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...South wind waves with building northwest
swells at 8 seconds, 12 seconds, and 18 seconds are expected.
The risk will be highest in the afternoon north of Cape Blanco,
and in the evening south of Cape Blanco.
