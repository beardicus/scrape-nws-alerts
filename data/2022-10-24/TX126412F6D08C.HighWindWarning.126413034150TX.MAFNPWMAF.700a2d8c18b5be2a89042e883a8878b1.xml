<headline>High Wind Warning issued October 24 at 2:47PM CDT until October 24 at 8:00PM CDT by NWS Midland-Odessa</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM CDT THIS
EVENING...
...FREEZE WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH
TUESDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...For the High Wind Warning, west winds 35 to 45 mph with
gusts up to 60 to 65 mph are expected. For the Freeze Watch,
sub- freezing temperatures as low as 29 degrees are possible.
* WHERE...Chinati and Davis Mountains.
* WHEN...For the High Wind Warning, until 8 PM CDT today. For the
Freeze Watch, from late tonight through Tuesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Winds will be particularly hazardous at higher
elevations where the strongest winds are likely to occur. Be
especially careful driving in these mountainous areas. Frost
and freeze conditions could kill crops, other sensitive
vegetation and possibly damage unprotected outdoor plumbing.</description>
<instruction>People should avoid being outside in forested areas and around
trees and branches. If possible, remain in the lower levels of
your home during the windstorm, and avoid windows. Use caution if
you must drive.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
