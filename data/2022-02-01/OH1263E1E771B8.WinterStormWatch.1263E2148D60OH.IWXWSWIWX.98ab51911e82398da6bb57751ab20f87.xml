<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued February 01 at 5:38AM EST until February 04 at 1:00AM EST by NWS NorthernIndiana</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY MORNING
THROUGH LATE THURSDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected, possibly mixed with sleet and
freezing rain early. Blowing snow developing Thursday with
dangerous travel expected. Total snow accumulations 10 to 15
inches.
* WHERE...Portions of northern Indiana and northwest Ohio from
Marion to Lima.
* WHEN...From Wednesday morning through late Thursday night.
* IMPACTS...Travel could become very difficult to impossible.
Blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility especially
Thursday. The hazardous conditions will affect Wednesday and
Thursday commutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Rain will change to snow from northwest
to southeast on Wednesday. Some freezing rain and sleet could
mix in at times. This will likely be a long duration snow
event, with periods of moderate to heavy snow and reduced
visibilities possible Wednesday afternoon through Thursday
evening.</description>
<instruction>This storm will bring potentially dangerous winter weather early
Wednesday through Thursday. Unplowed roads are likely to become
impassable over most areas. Plummeting wind chills accompanied by
blowing and drifting snow could bring a potentially lethal travel
situation with wind chills falling below zero if you become stuck
in your vehicle Thursday night. Plan now to make any needed
travel changes to avoid travel during this time. Monitor the
latest forecasts for updates on this developing major winter
storm. If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and
water in your vehicle in case of an emergency.</instruction>
