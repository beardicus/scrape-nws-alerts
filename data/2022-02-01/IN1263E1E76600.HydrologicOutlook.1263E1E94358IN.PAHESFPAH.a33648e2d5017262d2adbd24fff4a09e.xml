<description>...Moderate to Locally Heavy Rainfall may lead to localized
flooding Thursday...
Moderate to locally heavy rainfall is expected to develop ahead of
a slow moving Arctic cold front very late Wednesday night into
Thursday.
Soil conditions remain quite moist across the region ahead of the
expected rainfall. The ground will have less capacity to absorb
the rain, causing the rain to runoff quicker into ditches, creeks
and streams. The colder temperatures expected with the approaching
Arctic cold front will also lessen the evaporation of the
rainfall.
At this time, western Kentucky, especially across parts of the
extreme southern sections of the Purchase and Pennyrile region of
west Kentucky remain the most vulnerable to rapid rises of water
levels in low-lying and poorly drained locations. Some overland
flooding may occur, especially in flood prone areas late Thursday.
If you live or work in areas especially prone to flooding, stay
tuned to the latest forecast and monitor for statements regarding
flooding potential in your area.</description>
