<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT TONIGHT TO MIDNIGHT
CST THURSDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Heavy mixed winter precipitation expected. Total snow and
sleet accumulation between 4 and 11 inches with the highest
amounts from southeast Kansas into west central and central
Missouri. Freezing rain  accumulation up to around one quarter of
an inch with the best chances along and south of I-44.
* WHERE...Portions of southeast Kansas. Portions of central, east
central, south central, southwest, and west central Missouri.
* WHEN...From midnight tonight to midnight CST Thursday Night. From
late Tuesday night through Thursday evening. Rain will spread into
the area during the day Tuesday with a cold frontal passage. As
very cold air begins to move into the region Tuesday night, rain
will change over to a mix of snow, sleet, and freezing rain toward
midnight over southeast Kansas into central Missouri. The wintry
mix will reach counties near the I-44
corridor by 4 to 6 am Wednesday, then to near the Arkansas state
line
by midday Wednesday. The precipitation will transition to mostly
snow Wednesday night with a wintry mix still possible close to the
Arkansas state line. Snow will continue Thursday before gradually
tapering off late in the day and in the evening.
* IMPACTS...Roads will likely become ice and snow covered with
widespread disruption of travel expected, especially where roads
are untreated. Sporadic power outages may be possible where
heavier ice occurs.</description>
