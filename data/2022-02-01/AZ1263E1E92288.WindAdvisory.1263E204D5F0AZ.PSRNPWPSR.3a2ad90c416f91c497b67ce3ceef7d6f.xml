<headline>Wind Advisory issued February 01 at 2:46PM MST until February 02 at 8:00PM MST by NWS Phoenix</headline>
<description>...BLOWING DUST ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM TO 8 PM MST
WEDNESDAY...
...WIND ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM TO 8 PM MST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...North winds 20 to 30 mph with gusts of 35 to 45 mph
expected and occasionally isolated stronger gusts up to 50 mph
possible.
* WHERE...Gila River Valley, Southeast Yuma County, Kofa,
Central La Paz County and Yuma.
* WHEN...From 11 AM to 8 PM MST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Difficult driving conditions, especially for larger
vehicles traveling along roads with crosswinds. Northerly winds
will create the strongest crosswinds on east-west oriented roads
and highways. Light, unsecured objects may become airborne.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Areas of blowing dust are possible with
these wind speeds, particularly around open desert or freshly
tilled fields. Diffused lofted dust is also possible.</description>
<instruction>A Wind Advisory means that sustained wind speeds of between
30 and 40 mph are expected, or wind gusts of between 40 and
58 mph. Winds this strong can make driving difficult, especially
for high profile vehicles. In addition, strong winds over desert
areas could result in briefly lowered visibilities to well under
a mile at times in blowing dust or blowing sand. Use extra
caution.
Be ready for a sudden drop in visibility. If you encounter
blowing dust or blowing sand on the roadway or see it
approaching, pull off the road as far as possible and put your
vehicle in park. Turn the lights all the way off and keep your
foot off the brake pedal.
Remember, pull aside, stay alive.</instruction>
