<description>...Wintry Mix expected Thursday afternoon and Thursday Night...
A wintry mix of freezing rain and sleet is expected to impact
parts of southeast Pennyrile region of west Kentucky late Thursday
afternoon and Thursday night.
For residents and travelers in this area, moderate to locally
heavy rainfall is expected to change to freezing rain, occasionally
mixed with sleet, late Thursday afternoon and overnight.
Total ice and sleet accumulations are expected to remain near a
tenth of an inch during this time period.
The combination of ice and sleet will make travel quite hazardous,
especially Thursday night.
Depending on the exact timing and intensity of this wintry mix, a
winter storm warning or advisory could be issued for this area in
the future.
Now is a good time to make sure you have your home and car
emergency weather kits ready to go. Review your winter weather
preparedness plans and be prepared to take action.
Stay tuned to the latest forecast and statement from the National
Weather Service for additional details on this evolving winter
storm.</description>
