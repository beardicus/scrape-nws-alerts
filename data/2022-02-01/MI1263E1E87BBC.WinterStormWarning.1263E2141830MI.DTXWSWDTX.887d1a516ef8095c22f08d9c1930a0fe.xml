<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM WEDNESDAY TO 10 PM
EST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 11 to
15 inches.
* WHERE...Washtenaw, Wayne, Lenawee and Monroe Counties.
* WHEN...From 6 AM Wednesday to 10 PM EST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Rain is expected to change over to snow
during the mid morning hours on Wednesday, with snow then
increasing in coverage. Prolonged snowfall will then persist
through the remainder of the day, likely continuing well into
Thursday. For Wednesday, snowfall rates on the order of a half
inch to three quarters of an inch are expected, with possible
rates up to an inch per hour at times. A decrease in snow rates
or even a brief lull in snow coverage is possible after
Midnight, with an uptick in rates and coverage then expected
again starting late Thursday morning into Thursday afternoon.
Gusty winds from the north also may contribute to blowing snow
and reductions to visibilities by Wednesday afternoon.</description>
<instruction>Significant impacts to travel are expected. Unplowed roads are
likely to become impassable over many areas. Additionally, wind
chills drop into the single digits by Thursday morning and
negative single digits by Friday morning. Plan now to make any
needed travel changes to avoid travel during this time. If you
must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in your
vehicle in case of an emergency.</instruction>
