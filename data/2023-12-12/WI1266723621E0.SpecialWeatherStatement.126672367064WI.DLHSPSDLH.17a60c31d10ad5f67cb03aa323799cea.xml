<headline>Special Weather Statement issued December 12 at 5:44AM CST  by NWS Duluth</headline>
<description>...BRIEF BURST OF HEAVY SNOW EARLY THIS MORNING...
At 545 AM CST heavy snow showers were along a line from near
Cromwell to Duluth to Two Harbors to Brimson MN. The heavy snow
showers were moving southeast at 30 to 35 mph.
Expect visibility to drop rapidly to 1/4 to 1/2 mile. Quick snow
accumulation on roads of a few tenths of an inch may create
slippery stretches on roads.
Areas impacted through 8 AM will include Cloquet, Superior,
Maple, Solon Springs, Iron River, and Port Wing. This includes
I-35 between Duluth and Moose Lake, Highway 53 in Wisconsin
between Duluth and Solon Springs, and Highway 2 in Wisconsin
between Duluth and Moquah.
Be prepared for areas of blowing and drifting snow. This could
lead to temporary whiteout conditions and the potential for
dangerous driving conditions. If you are traveling and encounter
adverse winter driving conditions...reduce speed and make sure
headlights are on.</description>
