AFTERNOON...

up to one inch. Winds gusting as high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...Shishmaref and Bering Strait Coast.
* WHEN...Until 4 PM AKST this afternoon.

could significantly reduce visibility. The cold wind chills as
low as 25 below zero could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as
little as 30 minutes.

strong winds and waves could also lead to heavy freezing spray
which may create light ice accumulations on surfaces.</description>

expected or occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds
and poor visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout
conditions, making travel extremely difficult.</instruction>
