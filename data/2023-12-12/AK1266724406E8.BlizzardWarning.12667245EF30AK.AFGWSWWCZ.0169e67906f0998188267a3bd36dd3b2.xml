<headline>Blizzard Warning issued December 12 at 5:50PM AKST until December 13 at 6:00AM AKST by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM AKST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions. Additional snow accumulations of
up to one inch. Winds gusting as high as 55 mph. Visibility
one quarter mile or less.
* WHERE...Shishmaref and Bering Strait Coast.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM AKST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The cold wind
chills as low as 25 below zero could cause frostbite on
exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...In addition to reducing visibility,
strong winds and waves could also lead to heavy freezing spray
which may create light ice accumulations on surfaces.</description>
<instruction>A Blizzard Warning means severe winter weather conditions are
expected or occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds
and poor visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout
conditions, making travel extremely difficult.</instruction>
