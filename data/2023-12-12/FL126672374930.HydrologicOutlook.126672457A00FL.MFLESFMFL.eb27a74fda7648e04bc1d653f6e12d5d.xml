<description>...Flood Watch Possible For Portions Of South Florida Late This
Week Into This Weekend...
The long range models are still showing a stationary front moving
northward from the Florida Straits into South Florida late this
week, as high pressure slowly moves eastward over the Southeastern
United States. By this weekend, a low pressure system will start
to form over the Central Gulf of Mexico and move northeast into
the Southeastern United States. This system will bring a slowly moving
warm front across South Florida early this weekend, with a cold
front moving southward through the region by late this weekend.
This weather pattern will allow for a southwest steering flow to set
up over South Florida late this week into this weekend, which will
bring deep tropical moisture into the area from the Southern Gulf
of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. At the same time, the surface
winds will be east to northeast late this week, before going
south to southwest this weekend ahead of the cold front over
South Florida. These two sources of moisture will allow for the
PWAT values to increase to around 2 inches, which is near the
maximum for this time of year over South Florida.
Therefore, heavy rainfall is starting to look more likely for
South Florida late this week into this weekend, especially over
the east coast metro. Total rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches are
possible over South Florida from late this week into this weekend,
with the higher end of that range over the east coast metro.
Rainfall amounts could even be higher where any heavy rainfall
sets up due to training of showers and thunderstorms over the same
area.
We will continue to monitor the heavy rainfall potential for
South Florida, and a Flood Watch may be needed for portions of
the area from later this week into this weekend.</description>
