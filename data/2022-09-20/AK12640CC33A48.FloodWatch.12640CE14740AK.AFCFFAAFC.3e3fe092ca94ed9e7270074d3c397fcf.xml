<headline>Flood Watch issued September 20 at 7:06AM AKDT  by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...The Copper River Basin, especially along rivers and
streams in the southern Basin, including McCarthy and the McCarthy
Road.
* WHEN...Through late Wednesday night.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- There remains good potential for periods of heavy rain
through Wednesday night. There is some uncertainty in the
exact timing and placement of heaviest rain. At this point in
time, it looks like the heaviest rain for the Copper River
Basin will be Tuesday afternoon through Wednesday afternoon.
Storm total rainfall of 1 to 2 inches with 2 to 6 inches in
the Chugach and Wrangell Mountains north of McCarthy. Rivers
and streams that drain the Chugach and Wrangell Mountains are
most likely to experience out of banks flooding. This could
produce flooding along the McCarthy Road on into McCarthy.
