<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of east central Arizona, northeast Arizona and
west central Arizona, including the following areas, in east
central Arizona, Northern Gila County. In northeast Arizona, the
White Mountains. In west central Arizona, Yavapai County Mountains
and Yavapai County Valleys and Basins.
* WHEN...Through Thursday evening.
* IMPACTS...Flash flooding will be possible in creeks, normally dry
washes, swimming holes and over recently burned areas. Low-water

deadly travel conditions. Consider changing your plans if you were
going to hike, boat, or paddleboard to a slot canyon or normally
dry wash. If you do still decide to recreate, check in at a nearby
visitor center or ranger station.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Deep moisture will interact with a low pressure system west
of the state to bring a threat of occasional showers and
thunderstorms with heavy rainfall from Tuesday afternoon
through Thursday evening.
