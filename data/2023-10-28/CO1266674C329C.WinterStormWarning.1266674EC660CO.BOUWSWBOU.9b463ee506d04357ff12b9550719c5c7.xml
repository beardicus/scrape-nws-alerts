<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued October 28 at 7:11PM MDT until October 29 at 12:00PM MDT by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>...HEAVIER SNOW MOVING INTO THE FOOTHILLS AND I-25 CORRIDOR THIS
EVENING...
.The heaviest snow associated with the current weather system will
spread across the foothills and Interstate 25 corridor this evening,
and will spread across the plains east and southeast of Denver
overnight.  Periods of heavy snow with snowfall rates over an inch
per hour can be expected in the foothills and from Boulder and
Denver south to Monument Hill this evening. This will cause roads to
become slushy or icy at times in these areas, especially in the
foothills west and southwest of Denver. Travelers should allow extra
time and drive carefully this evening, or consider delaying
unnecessary travel.
The snow will decrease later tonight, though light snow will
continue into Sunday morning and roads may still be slippery in some
areas.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON MDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow. Additional snow accumulations between 3 and 7
inches.
* WHERE...Rabbit Ears Pass, Rocky Mountain National Park and the
Medicine Bow Range, and The Mountains of Summit County, the
Mosquito Range, and the Indian Peaks.
* WHEN...The heaviest snow will be overnight tonight, with lighter
snow diminishing during the day Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Snow covered roads will make travel hazardous. Travel
could be very difficult.</description>
<instruction>Persons should consider delaying all travel. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution. Consider taking a winter
storm kit along with you, including such items as tire chains,
booster cables, flashlight, shovel, blankets and extra clothing.
Also take water, a first aid kit, and anything else that would help
you survive in case you become stranded.
Chain and traction laws will possibly be enacted for the mountains.
The latest road conditions for Colorado can be obtained by calling 5
