<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued October 28 at 3:29AM CDT until October 29 at 7:00AM CDT by NWS Hastings</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM THIS MORNING TO
7 AM CDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Snow and a bit of mixed precipitation expected. Total
snow accumulations of 1 to 3 inches. Little to no ice
accumulation is expected.
* WHERE...Gosper and Furnas Counties.
* WHEN...From 10 AM this morning to 7 AM CDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Several bands of light to moderate snow,
possibly briefly mixed with sleet, will move through the
advisory area at various times from late this morning into the
overnight. This will not be a continuous precipitation event,
but rather off and on in nature. While air temperatures will be
plenty cold for snow and sleet pellets, ground temperatures
still remain relatively warm and it may take a while for
snowfall to accumulate. However, this may also contribute to
slippery road conditions if snow melts and then refreezes on
area surfaces, especially after sunset this evening.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
