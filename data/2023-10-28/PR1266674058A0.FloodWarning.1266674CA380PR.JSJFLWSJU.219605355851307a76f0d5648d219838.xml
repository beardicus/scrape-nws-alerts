<headline>Flood Warning issued October 28 at 8:44PM ADT  by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT AST TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is ongoing.
* WHERE...Rio Blanco`s basin in Naguabo.
* WHEN...Until midnight AST tonight.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring. Various roads
remain closed due to flooding. Streams continue to rise due to
excess runoff from earlier rainfall. Low-water crossings are
inundated with water and may not be passable. Expect many areas of
slow moving or standing water. It will take several hours for all
the water from these storms to work through local drainage systems
in urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 742 PM AST, Doppler radar indicated that heavy rain has
ended, with radar-estimated rainfall totals between 1 and 3
inches over the warned area. Nonetheless, excessive runoff
maintains Rio Blanco streamflow above flood stage. In fact,
emergency management reported ongoing flooding along Rio
Blanco`s banks, affecting road PR-191 near Sector Pitina,
Barrio Florida in Naguabo. This road remains impassable.
- Additional rainfall amounts up to 1 inch are possible in the
warned area.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
