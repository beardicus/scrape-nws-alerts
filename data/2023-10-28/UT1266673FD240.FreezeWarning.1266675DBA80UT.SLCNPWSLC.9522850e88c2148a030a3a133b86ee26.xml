<description>...WIND ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM THIS EVENING TO NOON
MDT SUNDAY...
...FREEZE WARNING IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT TONIGHT TO 10 AM MDT
MONDAY...
* WHAT...For the Wind Advisory, northeast winds 25 to 35 mph with
gusts up to 55 mph expected. For the Freeze Warning, sub-
freezing temperatures between 28 to 32 degrees expected,
especially Monday morning.
* WHERE...Lower Washington County.
* WHEN...For the Wind Advisory, from 9 PM this evening to noon
MDT Sunday. For the Freeze Warning, from midnight tonight to
10 AM MDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Gusty winds could blow around unsecured objects. A
few power outages are possible. Travel could be difficult due
to crosswinds, especially for high profile vehicles and
vehicles with trailers. Frost and freeze conditions will kill
crops, other sensitive vegetation and possibly damage
unprotected outdoor plumbing.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...For Sunday morning expect most elevations
below roughly 3500 feet to remain above freezing. During the
day on Sunday, temperatures will rise back above freezing. By
Monday morning the remaining elevations in Washington County
will likely be near, or below, freezing.</description>
<instruction>Use extra caution when driving, especially if operating a high
profile vehicle. Secure outdoor objects.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
