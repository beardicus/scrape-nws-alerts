<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued December 11 at 1:38PM MST until December 15 at 5:00AM MST by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>...POTENT WINTER STORM LIKELY EARLY TUESDAY THROUGH MIDWEEK...
.A strong winter storm will impact the region Tuesday through
Wednesday, with heavy snow, wind, and mixed precipitation
for portions of northeast Wyoming and western South Dakota.
Several inches of snow is likely in many areas, especially in the
northern Black Hills where there is the potential for 1 to 2 feet
of snow. In addition, strong northwest winds, with gusts over 50
mph, will be possible on the plains east of the Black Hills,
supporting potential blizzard conditions. Further east into south
central South Dakota, there will be the potential for freezing
rain and sleet with icing possible. Uncertainty still remains at
this time with respect to the track, duration, and intensity of
the storm, which will impact snow amounts and winds. This is
especially the case for areas just east and southeast of the Black
Hills (including Rapid City, Custer, Newcastle, and Hermosa),
where downslope drying could highly affect snow amounts. Listen to
NOAA Weather Radio or your local media for the latest updates on
this storm.
...WINTER STORM WATCH NOW IN EFFECT FROM LATE MONDAY NIGHT
THROUGH LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions possible. Total snow accumulations
of 8 to 18 inches and ice accumulations of a light glaze
possible. Winds could gust as high as 60 mph.
* WHERE...Butte County, the Northern Meade County Plains, the
Pennington County Plains, the Sturgis/Piedmont Foot Hills and
the Southern Meade County Plains.
* WHEN...From late Monday night through late Wednesday night.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible.
Widespread blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility.
Strong winds could cause extensive damage to trees and power
lines.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Watch for blizzard conditions means falling and
blowing snow with strong winds may produce dangerous whiteout
conditions. Monitor NOAA weather radio, local radio or
television, or the Internet for updates on this potentially
dangerous storm. Take time to prepare for severe winter
conditions before the storm develops.</instruction>
