<headline>Flood Advisory issued December 11 at 3:32AM PST  by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 845 AM PST THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Urban and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Los Angeles County including the Fish Burn scar.
* WHEN...Until 845 AM PST.
* IMPACTS...Moderate to heavy rain will cause ponding of water on
area roadways and local flooding of low lying areas and
intersections.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 314 AM PST, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated moderate to heavy rain was overspreading Los
Angeles County. Rainfall rates of 0.20 to 0.50 inches per
hour are expected in coastal and valley areas, with rates
between 0.40 to 0.80 inches per hour in the foothills and
mountains. This will cause widespread ponding of water on
area roads and urban flooding this morning. The rain may
increase in intensity which could cause some minor mud and
debris flows in and below the recent burn scars, especially
the Fish burn scar.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Acton, Mount Wilson, Pasadena, Alhambra, Duarte, Burbank,
Glendora, West Covina, Downtown Los Angeles, Universal City,
North Hollywood, Hollywood, San Dimas, Whittier, Beverly
Hills, Pomona, Long Beach and the Fish Burn scar.

<instruction>The rain may trigger shallow mud and debris flows, minor rock falls,
and flooding capable of localized damage, especially in steep
terrain in and near burn scars.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.</instruction>
