<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued December 11 at 1:38PM MST until December 15 at 5:00AM MST by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>...POTENT WINTER STORM LIKELY EARLY TUESDAY THROUGH MIDWEEK...
.A strong winter storm will impact the region Tuesday through
Wednesday, with heavy snow, wind, and mixed precipitation
for portions of northeast Wyoming and western South Dakota.
Several inches of snow is likely in many areas, especially in the
northern Black Hills where there is the potential for 1 to 2 feet
of snow. In addition, strong northwest winds, with gusts over 50
mph, will be possible on the plains east of the Black Hills,
supporting potential blizzard conditions. Further east into south
central South Dakota, there will be the potential for freezing
rain and sleet with icing possible. Uncertainty still remains at
this time with respect to the track, duration, and intensity of
the storm, which will impact snow amounts and winds. This is
especially the case for areas just east and southeast of the Black
Hills (including Rapid City, Custer, Newcastle, and Hermosa),
where downslope drying could highly affect snow amounts. Listen to
NOAA Weather Radio or your local media for the latest updates on
this storm.
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY EVENING
THROUGH LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 6 to 15
inches possible. Winds could gust as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Northern Campbell County, Southern Campbell County,
Western Crook County and Northeastern Crook County.
* WHEN...From Monday evening through late Wednesday night.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible.

<instruction>A Winter Storm Watch means heavy snow, strong winds, freezing
precipitation, and cold temperatures are possible. Monitor NOAA
weather radio, local radio or television, or the Internet for
updates on this potentially dangerous storm. Take time to
prepare for severe winter conditions before the storm develops.</instruction>
