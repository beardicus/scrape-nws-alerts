* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall will be possible.
* WHERE...A portion of Southwest California, including the following
areas, Riverside County Mountains and San Bernardino County
Mountains.

debris flows possible in and below recent burn scars, including
the Apple and El Dorado burn scars.
