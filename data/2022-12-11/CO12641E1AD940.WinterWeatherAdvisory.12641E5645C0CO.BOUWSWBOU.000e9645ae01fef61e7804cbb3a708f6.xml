<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 11 at 3:56AM MST until December 14 at 5:00PM MST by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>...POTENT WINTER STORM HEADED FOR THE REGION...
.A strong winter storm system will move into the Great Basin
tonight, and then track toward southeast Colorado Monday night, and
then lift northeast into Nebraska by Tuesday. This track means that
significant travel impacts will be possible especially over portions
of the northeast plains of Colorado into adjacent western Nebraska
and parts of eastern Wyoming.  Blizzard or near blizzard conditions
may develop over the eastern plains of Colorado as the storm
intensifies late Monday night and Tuesday. Strong winds are expected
to gust to 50-60 mph, and combined with falling snow create blizzard
conditions.  There is still considerable uncertainty with regard to
eventual storm totals and exactly how far east or west the heavier
snow on the plains will be.  Thus, anyone planning to travel or
those with outdoor livestock interests should pay particular
attention to the latest winter storm watches, warnings, and
statements from the National Weather Service and your local news
media.
