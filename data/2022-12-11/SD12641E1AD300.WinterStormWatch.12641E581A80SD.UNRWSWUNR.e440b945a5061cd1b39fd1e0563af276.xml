<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued December 11 at 3:40AM MST until December 15 at 5:00AM MST by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>...POTENT WINTER STORM LIKELY LATE MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH
MIDWEEK...
.A strong winter storm will impact the region Tuesday through
Wednesday, with heavy snow, wind, and mixed precipitation
possible for portions of northeast Wyoming and western South
Dakota. Several inches or more of snow is likely in many areas,
especially in the northern Black Hills where there is the
potential for 1 to 2 feet of snow. In addition, strong northwest
winds, with gusts over 50 mph, will be possible on the plains
east of the Black Hills, supporting potential blizzard conditions.
Further east into south central South Dakota, there will be the
potential for freezing rain and sleet with icing possible.
Uncertainty still remains at this time with respect to the track,
duration, and intensity of the storm, which will impact snow
amounts and winds. This is especially the case for areas just east
and southeast of the Black Hills (including Rapid City, Custer,
and Hermosa) where downslope drying could highly affect snow
amounts. Listen to NOAA Weather Radio or your local media for the
latest updates on this storm.
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY EVENING
THROUGH LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions possible. Total snow accumulations of
10 to 20 inches possible. Winds could gust as high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...Oglala Lakota County, Jackson County and Bennett
County. This includes the Tribal Lands of the Pine Ridge
Reservation.
* WHEN...From Monday evening through late Wednesday night.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible.
Widespread blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility.
Gusty winds could bring down tree branches.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Watch for blizzard conditions means falling and
blowing snow with strong winds may produce dangerous whiteout
conditions. Monitor NOAA weather radio, local radio or
television, or the Internet for updates on this potentially
dangerous storm. Take time to prepare for severe winter
conditions before the storm develops.</instruction>
