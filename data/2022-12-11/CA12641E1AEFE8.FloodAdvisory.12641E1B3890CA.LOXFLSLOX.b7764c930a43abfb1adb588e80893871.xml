<headline>Flood Advisory issued December 11 at 3:14AM PST  by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 AM PST THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Urban and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall continues.
* WHERE...Ventura, eastern Santa Barbara, and western Los Angeles
Counties in Southwest California, including the Route and Lake
burn scars.
* WHEN...Until 700 AM PST.
* IMPACTS...Moderate to heavy rainfall will cause rises in small
streams and normally dry arroyos and could trigger shallow debris
flows in and near recent wildfire burn scars. Water ponding on
roadways is likely.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 310 AM PST, Doppler radar indicated moderate to heavy rain
falling across Ventura and western Los Angeles Counties. The
heaviest rainfall has been observed in western Ventura County
and in the foothill areas along the south-facing slopes of
the Ventura County mountains. Automated rain gauges indicate
rainfall rates between 0.25 and 0.33 inch per hour across the
coastal and valley areas with up to 0.50 to 0.90 inch per
hour in the foothill and mountain areas. This will cause
urban and small stream flooding and roadways will become
flooded.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Oxnard, Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley, Ventura, Camarillo,
Fillmore, Malibu, Ojai, Agoura Hills, Chatsworth, Woodland
Hills, Northridge, Encino and Santa Clarita.
- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood</description>
<instruction>The rain will likely trigger minor mud and debris flows, minor rock
falls, and flooding capable of localized damage, especially in steep
terrain in and near burn scars.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles. Be especially cautious at night when it is
harder to recognize the dangers of flooding.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
