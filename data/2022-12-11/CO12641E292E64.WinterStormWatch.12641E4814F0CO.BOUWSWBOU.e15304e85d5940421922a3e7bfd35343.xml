<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued December 11 at 9:49PM MST until December 14 at 12:00AM MST by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>...POTENT WINTER STORM HEADED FOR THE REGION...
.A strong winter storm system will move into the Great Basin
tonight, track toward southeast Colorado Monday night, and then lift
northeast into Nebraska by Tuesday. This track means that
significant travel impacts will be possible especially over portions
of the northeast plains of Colorado into adjacent western Nebraska
and parts of eastern Wyoming.  Blizzard conditions may develop over
northeastern Colorado as the storm intensifies late Monday night and
Tuesday. Strong winds are expected to gust to 50-60 mph, creating
blizzard conditions.  There is still some uncertainty about snow
amounts, but the heaviest snow should be on the plains east of
Greeley and Denver, especially in the northeast corner of Colorado.
People planning travel north or east of Denver Tuesday, or those
with outdoor livestock interests should prepare for likely blizzard
conditions on Tuesday and continued cold and windy weather behind
the storm Wednesday and Thursday.
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE MONDAY NIGHT
THROUGH TUESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions possible. Total snow accumulations
between 4 and 10 inches possible. Winds could gust as high as 60
mph.
* WHERE...Much of northeastern Colorado including Julesburg,
Holyoke, Sterling, Akron, Fort Morgan, and Byers.
* WHEN...From late Monday night through Tuesday evening. Some light
snow, blowing snow, and gusty winds may linger into Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Visibility may be near zero at times resulting in
whiteout conditions. Travel may be treacherous and potentially
life-threatening. Road closures and impassable roads are likely.
Strong winds will cause extensive drifting snow and may cause
minor damage and power outages. Strong winds will continue to
cause drifting snow in northeastern Colorado on Wednesday and
possibly into Thursday.</description>
<instruction>Prepare for possible blizzard conditions, road closures, and the
possibility of being stranded. Continue to monitor the latest
forecasts for updates on this situation.
Consider alternate travel plans rather than traveling north or east
of Denver on Tuesday. If travel is absolutely necessary, be prepared
for road closures or possible stranding. Take a winter storm kit
along with you, including such items as tire chains, booster cables,
flashlight, shovel, blankets and extra clothing. Also take water, a
first aid kit, and anything else that would help you survive in your
car for an extended time.</instruction>
