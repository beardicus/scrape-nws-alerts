<headline>Flood Advisory issued December 11 at 12:28AM PST  by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 AM PST EARLY THIS
MORNING...
* WHAT...Urban and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall continues.
* WHERE...Santa Barbara County.
* WHEN...Until 300 AM PST.
* IMPACTS...Flooding will travel difficult overnight.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1217 AM PST, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated heavy rain across much of Santa Barbara County. The
heaviest rain was focused in the Santa Ynez Range and
adjacent foothills, where rainfall rates of 0.50 to 0.80
inches per hour were common, with isolated rates near 1 inch
per hour. This may cause minor mud and debris flows in and
around the Alisal Burn area through the early morning hours.
Most other locations were experiencing rainfall rates of 0.20
to 0.50 inches per hour, which will cause widespread ponding
of water on area roadways and flooding of low lying areas and
intersections.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Santa Barbara, Montecito, Carpinteria, Solvang, El Capitan
State Beach, Refugio State Beach, Isla Vista, Highway 101
through Gaviota State Park, Los Alamos, Summerland and the
Alisal Burn area.

<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas. The rain will likely trigger
shallow mud and debris flows, minor rock falls, and flooding capable
of localized damage, especially in steep terrain in and near burn
scars.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.</instruction>
