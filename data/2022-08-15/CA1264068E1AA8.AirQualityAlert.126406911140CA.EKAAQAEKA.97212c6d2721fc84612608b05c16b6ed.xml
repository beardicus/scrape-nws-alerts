<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM PDT TUESDAY FOR PORTIONS OF
NORTHERN TRINITY COUNTY...
Due to persistent smoke from the Six Rivers Lightning Complex Fires,
the North Coast Unified Air Quality Management District has issued
an Air Quality Alert in effect at least through 1 PM PDT on Tuesday for
much of the Trinity River Valley. This includes the locations of
Salyer, Burnt Ranch, Hawkins Bar and Junction City.
An Air Quality Alert means that air quality will be hazardous for
all groups of people. Everyone in these areas should limit the amount
of time they spend outdoors as much as possible. Keep windows closed,
do not run house fans that bring outside air indoors. Consider
leaving the area until smoke conditions improve if you have repeated
coughing, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, wheezing, chest
tightness or pain, palpitations, nausea, unusual fatigue, or
lightheadedness.
For more information, please visit the North Coast Unified Air
Quality Management District website at www.ncuaqd.org to access the
latest air quality alert.</description>
