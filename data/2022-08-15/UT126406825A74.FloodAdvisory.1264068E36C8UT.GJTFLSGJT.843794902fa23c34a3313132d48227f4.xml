<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 15 at 5:57PM MDT  by NWS GrandJunction</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 730 PM MDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Arroyo and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall continues.
* WHERE...A portion of east central Utah, including the area north
of I-70 from Thompson Springs to Crescent Junction in Grand County.
* WHEN...Until 730 PM MDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
Rises in small streams and normally dry arroyos. Some low-water
crossings may become impassable.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 557 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms. This will cause arroyo and small stream
flooding. Between 1 and 1.5 inches of rain have fallen.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 0.5 to 1 inch are expected
over the area. This additional rain will result in minor
flooding.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
mainly rural areas of Central Grand County</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Remain alert for flooding even in locations not receiving rain.
Arroyos, streams, and rivers can become raging killer currents in a
matter of minutes, even from distant rainfall.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
