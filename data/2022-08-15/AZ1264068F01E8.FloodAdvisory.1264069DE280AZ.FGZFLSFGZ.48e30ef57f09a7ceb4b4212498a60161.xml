<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 15 at 11:50PM MST  by NWS Flagstaff</headline>
<description>...THE FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1215 AM MST FOR
NORTHEASTERN YAVAPAI AND SOUTH CENTRAL COCONINO COUNTIES...
At 1147 PM MST, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain has ended in the
area but continued runoff from earlier heavy rainfall is still
possible. This could be resulting in continued minor flooding in the
advisory area.
Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Sedona, Soldiers Wash, Village At Oak Creek, Manzanita Campground
and Red Rock State Park.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Remain alert for flooding even in locations not receiving rain.
Washes, streams, and rivers can become raging killer currents in a
matter of minutes, even from distant rainfall.</instruction>
