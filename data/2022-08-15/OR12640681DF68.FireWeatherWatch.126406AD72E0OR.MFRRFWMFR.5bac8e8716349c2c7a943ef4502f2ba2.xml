<description>...Abundant Lightning On Dry Fuels Expected Wednesday...
.Instability increases Wednesday with scattered thunderstorms
possible in areas. Thunderstorms are expected to start dry, and
progressively become wetter. In addition to the threat of new fire
starts, a dry and unstable layer will support gusty and erratic
outflow winds with any thunderstorms. Plume-dominated fire activity
will be possible with new or existing fires due to hot, dry and
unstable conditions.

FIRE WEATHER ZONES 285...624 AND 625...
