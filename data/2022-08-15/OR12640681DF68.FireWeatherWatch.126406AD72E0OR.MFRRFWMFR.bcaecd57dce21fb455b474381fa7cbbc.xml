<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued August 15 at 1:42PM PDT until August 17 at 11:00PM PDT by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...Abundant Lightning On Dry Fuels Expected Wednesday...
.Instability increases Wednesday with scattered thunderstorms
possible in areas. Thunderstorms are expected to start dry, and
progressively become wetter. In addition to the threat of new fire
starts, a dry and unstable layer will support gusty and erratic
outflow winds with any thunderstorms. Plume-dominated fire activity
will be possible with new or existing fires due to hot, dry and
unstable conditions.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
WEDNESDAY EVENING FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE
WEATHER ZONES 280...281...284...617...621...622 AND 623...

Watch...which is in effect from Wednesday afternoon through
Wednesday evening.

portions of Siskiyou county.
In Southwest OR Fire Zones...617...621...622...623. This includes
extreme southeast Josephine county, southern and eastern Jackson
counties, and far eastern Douglas county.

If you have not packed your evacuation kit yet, now is the time to
do so. This includes items like important documents and essentials
you cannot live without. Fill your vehicle`s fuel tank. Visit
ready.gov/kit for more information.
Plan now to avoid using equipment that could cause sparks during
the period when critical weather conditions are possible. Visit
weather.gov/medford/wildfire for links to fire restrictions in
your area.
A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are possible during the valid watch time. These conditions could
promote the rapid spread of wildfires which could become life-
threatening. Check weather.gov/medford for forecast updates and a
possible upgrade of the this watch to a Red Flag Warning.
