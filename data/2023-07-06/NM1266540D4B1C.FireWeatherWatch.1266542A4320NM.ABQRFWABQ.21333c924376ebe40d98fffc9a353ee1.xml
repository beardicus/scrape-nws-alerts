<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued July 06 at 6:15AM MDT until July 07 at 8:00PM MDT by NWS Albuquerque</headline>
<description>...FIRE WEATHER WATCH FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING FOR THE
NORTHWEST PLATEAU, NORTH CENTRAL MOUNTAINS, UPPER RIO GRANDE AND
LOWER CHAMA RIVER VALLEY, AND WEST CENTRAL MOUNTAINS DUE TO STRONG
WINDS, LOW HUMIDITY, AND AN UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE WITH DRY LIGHTNING...
.Stronger west winds will develop on Friday, while humidities
plummet below 15 percent in many locations, and high temperatures
soar a few to 10 degrees above normal with a high Haines Index of
6. In addition, enough elevated subtropical moisture is forecast
to move northeastward over the area for gusty and dry
thunderstorms to develop. This means thunderstorms will produce
very little, if any, wetting rainfall at the surface along with
cloud-to-ground lightning that may ignite new wildfires.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
FRIDAY EVENING...
The National Weather Service in Albuquerque has issued a Fire
Weather Watch...which is in effect from Friday afternoon through
Friday evening.
* AREA AND TIMING...West central mountains (Zone 105) Friday
afternoon and early evening.
* 20 FOOT WINDS...West 15 to 25 mph with gusts up to 35 mph,
especially near the Arizona border.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...10 to 15 percent with the highest
humidities above 8500 feet.
* IMPACTS...Any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly.
Outdoor burning is not recommended.</description>
