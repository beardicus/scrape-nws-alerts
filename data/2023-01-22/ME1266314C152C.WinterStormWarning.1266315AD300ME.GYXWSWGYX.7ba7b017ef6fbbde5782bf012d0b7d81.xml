<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 22 at 10:39PM EST until January 23 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...WIDESPREAD MODERATE TO HEAVY SNOWFALL THROUGH MONDAY...
.Low pressure will cross New England tonight before exiting through
the Gulf of Maine on Monday. This will bring another round of
snowfall to the region. Moderate to heavy snowfall rates are
expected overnight tonight into Monday morning, with travel impacts
expected for the morning commute. There is a growing signal that a
band of moderate to heavy snow will develop in the afternoon into
the early evening hours, bringing difficult travel for the evening
commute. Snow may be wet and sticky across the south, which may
increase power outage risk. Power outage risk increases further as
winds turn gusty out of the northwest behind the storm system on
Monday afternoon into Monday night.
...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow. Additional snow accumulations between 5 and 8
inches for a storm total of 6 to 9 inches. Northwest winds gusting
as high as 35 mph Monday evening.
* WHERE...In Maine, Interior Cumberland Highlands and Southern
Oxford Counties. In New Hampshire, Northern Carroll County.
* WHEN...Until 7 PM EST Monday.
* IMPACTS...A snowstorm will bring plowable snow to the region with
a period of moderate travel impacts expected. Periods of moderate
snow and low visibility will be the biggest hazards, creating
dangerous driving conditions. The hazardous conditions could
impact the Monday morning and evening commutes.</description>

your vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road conditions can
