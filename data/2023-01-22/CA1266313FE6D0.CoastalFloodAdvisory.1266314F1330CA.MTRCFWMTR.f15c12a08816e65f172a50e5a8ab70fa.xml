<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued January 22 at 3:56PM PST until January 23 at 3:00PM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>...KING TIDES CONTINUE THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON, BRINGING MINOR
COASTAL FLOODING FOR LOW LYING AREAS...
.The highest astronomical tides of the year, commonly referred to
as the King Tides, will impact the coast and San Francisco Bay
shoreline through Monday the 23rd, and have historically resulted
in the localized flooding of specific low lying areas each year.
The lowest low tides of the event will be observed during the
late afternoon to early evening hours which may lead to trouble
for mariners navigating shallow waterways.
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 PM PST
MONDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT WILL EXPIRE AT 4 PM PST THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Minor coastal flooding expected at prone low lying
coastal locations across the coast during peak high tide each
day through Monday afternoon.
* WHERE...San Francisco, Coastal North Bay Including Point Reyes
National Seashore, San Francisco Peninsula Coast, Northern
Monterey Bay and Southern Monterey Bay and Big Sur Coast.
* WHEN...Until 3 PM PST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of areas previously impacted by King Tide
events is expected, including low lying lots, parks, and roads
along the coast with the highest high tides.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Tidal levels will rise along the Pacific
coast but impacts will be more localized to areas such as
Elkhorn Slough near Moss Landing and the mouth of the Salinas
river at the Salinas Lagoon. Beachgoers should be familiar with
times and heights of local tidal levels. Occurrence of sneaker
waves is no longer a high risk as northwest swell has
diminished, but continue to use caution near the ocean.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
