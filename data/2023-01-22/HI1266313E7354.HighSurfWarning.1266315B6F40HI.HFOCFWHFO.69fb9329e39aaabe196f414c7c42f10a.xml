ISLAND...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON FOR THE
WEST FACING SHORES OF MAUI AND LANAI...
.An extra large northwest (310-320 degree) swell will produce
extremely dangerous giant size surf. Coastal water overwash may
occur across many low lying roadways along northern and western
facing shorelines, especially during periods of high tide.
...HIGH SURF WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM HST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Large breaking waves up to 12 feet.
* WHERE...Kohala and Kona regions.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM HST Monday.
* IMPACTS...High. Expect very strong breaking waves and powerful
currents. Wave runup could impact coastal properties and
infrastructure, as well as overwash low lying roadways,
especially during morning high tide. Waves breaking in channel
entrances may make navigating the channels dangerous.</description>
<instruction>Stay away from the shoreline along the affected coasts. Be
prepared for road closures. Postpone entering or leaving channels
affected by the high surf until the surf subsides.</instruction>
