<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued January 22 at 6:03AM PST until January 24 at 6:00PM PST by NWS Eureka</headline>
<description>...A New Long Period Swell Builds in Monday Afternoon...
Forerunners of this long period westerly swell will arrive Monday
afternoon when the risk for sneaker waves begins. Large sets of
waves will sweep in after long lulls in wave activity. The swell
will build up to 12 feet at 18 seconds by Tuesday morning. Steep
beaches will have a higher risk of sneaker wave activity with
greater wave run- up onto beaches. Large waves will also wash over
jetties and rock outcroppings that may normally stay dry.
Very high tides and large tidal swings are expected. This may
cause localized coastal flooding around Humboldt Bay.
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM THIS
MORNING TO 2 PM PST THIS AFTERNOON...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH TUESDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, High astronomical tides
will cause minor flooding in low lying areas along the Humboldt
Coast. Up to one half foot of saltwater inundation above ground
level is possible in low lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways (Around 8.8 feet MLLW at the North Spit tide gauge).
For the Beach Hazards Statement, large unexpected waves along
the coast.
* WHERE...Northern Humboldt Coast County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 10 AM this morning
to 2 PM PST this afternoon. For the Beach Hazards Statement,
from Monday afternoon through Tuesday afternoon.. .
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Large, unexpected waves can
sweep across the beach without warning, sweeping people into
the sea from rocks, jetties, and beaches. These waves can also
move large objects such as logs, crushing anyone caught
underneath.</description>
<instruction>A Coastal Flood Advisory indicates that onshore winds and tides
will combine to generate flooding of low areas along the shore.
Feet Above Ground is locally defined as feet above the Highest
Astronomical Tide or HAT.
Don`t be fooled by an ocean that looks calm. There can be
30 minutes of small waves before a sneaker wave strikes. Avoid
rocks and jetties. Avoid steep beaches. Stay much farther back
from the water and never turn your back on the ocean.</instruction>
