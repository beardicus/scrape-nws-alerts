<description>...HEAVY RAIN SHOWERS WILL IMPACT ELBERT...LAURENS...ABBEVILLE AND
GREENWOOD COUNTIES THROUGH 900 PM EST...
At 605 PM EST, Regional Doppler radars were tracking a series of
showers moving from central Georgia across the lower Piedmont from
Elberton to Abbeville to Greenwood to Laurens. Much of this area has
already received 1 to 2 inches of rainfall today, and these showers
were producing additional rainfall at rates around one-half inch per
hour. An additional one-half to one inch of rainfall will be
possible in some areas this evening. Standing water in low-lying
areas will deepen and additional steady rises to near bankfull are
possible on a few creeks and streams.
Locations to be impacted include...
Greenwood, Laurens, Abbeville, Elberton, Clinton, Ware Shoals,
Calhoun Falls, Ninety Six, Joanna and Due West.
Heavy rainfall rates in excess of one-half inch per hour are
expected and localized minor flooding could develop this evening.</description>
<instruction>Heavy rainfall may flood areas with poor drainage, such as ditches
and underpasses. Avoid these areas and do not cross any flooded
roads. Water levels of small streams may also rise rapidly.</instruction>
