<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS
EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM THIS MORNING
TO 10 PM PST MONDAY...
* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, minor beach erosion
and minor tidal overflow. For the High Surf Advisory, large
breaking waves of 9 to 13 feet with dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...San Luis Obispo County Beaches and Santa Barbara
County Central Coast Beaches.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, from 10 AM this morning to
10 PM PST Monday. For the Beach Hazards Statement, through
this evening.
* IMPACTS...Pooling of sea water is possible around high tide at
beach and harbor areas that is uncommon with normal tidal
ranges. Minor beach erosion is also possible. No significant
damage is expected. There is an increased risk for ocean
drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to
sea. Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off
beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The time of greatest concern will be
during morning high tide which will range between 7.0 and 7.3
feet between 730 AM and 900 AM this weekend.</description>
