<description>...HEAVY RAIN SHOWERS WILL IMPACT ELBERT...LAURENS...ABBEVILLE AND
GREENWOOD COUNTIES UNTIL 10 PM EST...
At 750 PM EST, Doppler radar was tracking a series of heavy rain
showers moving repeatedly northward across the lower Piedmont from
Elberton in northeast Georgia to Abbeville, Greenwood, and Laurens
in South Carolina. The heaviest showers were producing rainfall at
rates of one-half inch per hour, and these heavy showers were
affecting some locations that have received in excess of two inches
of rainfall today.
Locations to be impacted include...
Greenwood, Laurens, Abbeville, Elberton, Clinton, Ware Shoals,
Calhoun Falls, Ninety Six, Joanna and Due West.
The heavy rainfall will create deep ponding of water in low-lying
and poor drainage areas. Streams and creeks in the area will
continue to rise steadily and some may approach bankfull through 10
pm this evening.</description>
<instruction>Heavy rainfall may flood areas with poor drainage, such as ditches
and underpasses. Avoid these areas and do not cross flooded roads.
Water levels of small streams may also rise rapidly.</instruction>
