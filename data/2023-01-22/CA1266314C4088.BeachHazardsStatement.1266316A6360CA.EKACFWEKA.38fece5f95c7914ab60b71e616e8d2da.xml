<description>...A New Long Period Swell Builds in Monday Afternoon...
Forerunners of this long period westerly swell will arrive Monday
afternoon when the risk for sneaker waves begins. Large sets of
waves will sweep in after long lulls in wave activity. The swell
will build up to 12 feet at 18 seconds by Tuesday morning. Steep
beaches will have a higher risk of sneaker wave activity with
greater wave run- up onto beaches. Large waves will also wash
over jetties and rock outcroppings that may normally stay dry.
In addition to the waves...high tides and large tidal swings are
expected during the late morning hours each day through Tuesday
and may cause localized coastal flooding around Humboldt Bay.
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY
AFTERNOON THROUGH TUESDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Periods of unexpected larger waves along the coast.
* WHERE...Coastal Del Norte, Northern Humboldt Coast,
Southwestern Humboldt and Mendocino Coast Counties.
* WHEN...From Monday afternoon through Tuesday afternoon.. .
* IMPACTS...Large, unexpected waves can sweep across the beach
without warning, sweeping people into the sea from rocks,
jetties, and beaches. These waves can also move large objects
such as logs, crushing anyone caught underneath.</description>
<instruction>Don`t be fooled by an ocean that looks calm. There can be
30 minutes of small waves before a sneaker wave strikes. Avoid
rocks and jetties. Avoid steep beaches. Stay much farther back
from the water and never turn your back on the ocean.</instruction>
