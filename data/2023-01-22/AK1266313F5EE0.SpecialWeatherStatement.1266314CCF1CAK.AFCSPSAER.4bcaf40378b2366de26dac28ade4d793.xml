<description>...WARMER TEMPERATURES WITH SNOW TO RAIN EXPECTED ACROSS THE
COPPER RIVER BASIN THROUGH MIDWEEK...
A shift in the weather pattern is expected to bring warmer
temperatures along with a transition from snow to rain across
the region through the first half of the this week.
Light snow is expected to develop by late Sunday afternoon as a
series of weather fronts move from the northern Gulf over
Southcentral Alaska. The precipitation may transition briefly to a
wintry mix late Sunday night through early Monday morning along
the Edgerton Highway and the Richardson Highway south of the
Edgerton Highway junction as warmer air moves in aloft ahead of
the front. The front will then move farther inland by Monday
afternoon. Warmer air will move in behind the front along with an
increase in southerly winds. This combination of warmer air and
southerly winds will allow temperatures to climb above freezing
across the southern half of the Copper River Basin, transitioning
any lingering wintry mix to rain. Temperatures above freezing
along with areas of light rain along the Edgerton Highway are
expected to linger into Tuesday morning. A wintry mix of
precipitation is also likely for Wednesday as another front moves
over the region.
Any freezing rain or rain falling on cold or snow covered roadway
surfaces will likely lead to icy conditions and hazardous travel
conditions. Rain may also lead to water ponding on area roadways.
There is still some uncertainty as to the extent of the
precipitation across the Copper River Basin through Tuesday.
