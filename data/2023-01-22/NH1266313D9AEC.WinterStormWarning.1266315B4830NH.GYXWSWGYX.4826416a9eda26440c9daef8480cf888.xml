<description>...WIDESPREAD MODERATE TO HEAVY SNOWFALL TONIGHT INTO MONDAY...
.The next system in the ongoing active weather pattern is forecast
to pass through southern New England tonight before exiting through
the Gulf of Maine on Monday. This will bring another round of
snowfall to the region. Heaviest snowfall rates are expected to be
overnight tonight into Monday morning, with travel impacts expected
for the morning commute. With snow expected to last into the late
afternoon and early evening hours, travel may also be slick for the
evening commute.  Snow may be wet and sticky, which may increase
power outage risk. Power outage risk increases further as winds turn
gusty out of the northwest behind the storm system on Monday
afternoon into Monday night.
...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM THIS EVENING TO 10 PM
EST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 4 and
6 inches. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of south central and southwest Maine. Portions of
southern New Hampshire.
* WHEN...From 7 PM this evening to 10 PM EST Monday.
* IMPACTS...A snowstorm will bring plowable snow to the region with
a period of moderate travel impacts expected. Periods of moderate
snow and low visibility will be the biggest hazards. Periods of
moderate and heavy snow will combine with low visibility to create
dangerous driving conditions. The hazardous conditions could
impact the Monday morning and evening commutes. Wet and sticky
snow combined with gusty winds may lead to power outages,
especially close to the rain-snow line.</description>
