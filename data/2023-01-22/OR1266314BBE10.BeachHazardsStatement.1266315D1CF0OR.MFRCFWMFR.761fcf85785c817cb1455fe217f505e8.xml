<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY
AFTERNOON THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...High to extreme risk of sneaker waves expected. These
are waves that run unusually higher up on beaches when
compared to other observed waves.
* WHERE...Beaches along the Southern Oregon Coast, including the
beaches of Douglas, Coos, and Curry counties.
* WHEN...From Monday afternoon through Tuesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Even during calm conditions, sneaker waves can sweep
up the beach without warning and knock unsuspecting people
over and pull them out to sea. Shock and hypothermia can occur
quickly in the cold Pacific waters. In addition, logs and
other debris can be lifted and carried by the waves, crushing
or entrapping unsuspecting victims underneath.
