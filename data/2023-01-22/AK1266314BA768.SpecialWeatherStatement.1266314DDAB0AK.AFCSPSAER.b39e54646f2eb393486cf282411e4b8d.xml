<description>...WARMER TEMPERATURES WITH SNOW TO RAIN EXPECTED ACROSS THE
MATANUSKA VALLEY, ANCHORAGE BOWL, AND WESTERN KENAI PENINSULA
THROUGH MIDWEEK...
A shift in the weather pattern is expected to bring warmer
temperatures along with a transition from snow to rain across
the region through the first half of the this week.
Light snow is expected to develop sometime Monday morning or
early Monday afternoon as a series of weather fronts move from
the northern Gulf over Southcentral Alaska. The precipitation is
expected to transition briefly to a wintry mix of snow and
freezing rain Monday afternoon as warmer air moves in aloft ahead
of the front. The front will then move farther inland by late
Monday afternoon. Warmer air will move in behind the front along
with an increase in southerly winds. This combination of warmer
air and southerly winds will allow temperatures to climb above
freezing across the region with any wintry mix changing to rain.
Temperatures above freezing along with areas of light rain are
expected to linger into Tuesday morning.
Rain, or mixed rain/snow, is also possible for Wednesday as
another front moves over the region. While temperatures are
expected to remain in the mid 30s for this event, any deviation
in the track of this system could introduce slightly cooler air
and result in a rain/snow mix or wet snow.
Any freezing rain or rain falling on cold or snow covered roadway
surfaces will likely lead to icy conditions and hazardous travel
conditions. Rain may also lead to water ponding on area roadways.
There is still some uncertainty as to the timing of and extent
of the precipitation for Monday. Please monitor the forecast
closely for updates at www.weather.gov/afc.</description>
