<description>...GUSTY NORTHEAST WINDS AND DANGEROUS WIND CHILLS ACROSS EASTERN
SIERRA RIDGETOPS THROUGH MONDAY...
* Strong gusty northeast winds are expected tonight, lasting into
Monday. Winds will taper off through the Monday evening hours.
Expect Eastern Sierra ridges in addition to the White Mountains
to gust between 70 and 100 mph.
* In addition to possible wind-related impacts, the strong and
gusty winds coupled with very cold temperatures will result in
dangerous sub-zero wind chills between -20 and -30 degrees above
8000 feet, tonight through early afternoon Monday. With these
conditions, frostbite can occur in as little as 30 minutes to
exposed skin. If you are heading into the higher elevations, be
sure to dress in layers and keep all of your skin covered.</description>
