<description>...WIDESPREAD MODERATE TO HEAVY SNOWFALL THROUGH MONDAY...
.Low pressure will cross New England tonight before exiting through
the Gulf of Maine on Monday. This will bring another round of
snowfall to the region. Moderate to heavy snowfall rates are
expected overnight tonight into Monday morning, with travel impacts
expected for the morning commute. There is a growing signal that a
band of moderate to heavy snow will develop in the afternoon into
the early evening hours, bringing difficult travel for the evening
commute. Snow may be wet and sticky across the south, which may
increase power outage risk. Power outage risk increases further as
winds turn gusty out of the northwest behind the storm system on
Monday afternoon into Monday night.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Snow. Additional snow accumulations between 4 and 6 inches
for a storm total of 3 to 8 inches. Northwest winds gusting as
high as 35 mph Monday evening.
* WHERE...Portions of south central and western Maine. Portions of
northern New Hampshire.
* WHEN...Until 7 PM EST Monday.
* IMPACTS...An area of low pressure will bring a period of snowfall
to the region. Travel will be impacted due to snowfall
accumulations on roads. Periods of moderate and heavy snow will
combine with low visibility to create dangerous driving
conditions. The hazardous conditions could impact the Monday
morning commute.</description>
