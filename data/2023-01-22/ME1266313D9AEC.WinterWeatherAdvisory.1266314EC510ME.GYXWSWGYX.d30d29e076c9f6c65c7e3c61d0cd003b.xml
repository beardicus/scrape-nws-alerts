<description>...WIDESPREAD MODERATE TO HEAVY SNOWFALL TONIGHT INTO MONDAY...
.The next system in the ongoing active weather pattern is forecast
to pass through southern New England tonight before exiting through
the Gulf of Maine on Monday. This will bring another round of
snowfall to the region. Heaviest snowfall rates are expected to be
overnight tonight into Monday morning, with travel impacts expected
for the morning commute. With snow expected to last into the late
afternoon and early evening hours, travel may also be slick for the
evening commute.  Snow may be wet and sticky, which may increase
power outage risk. Power outage risk increases further as winds turn
gusty out of the northwest behind the storm system on Monday
afternoon into Monday night.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM THIS EVENING TO 4 PM
EST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 4 and 6
inches.
* WHERE...Portions of south central and western Maine. Portions of
northern New Hampshire.
* WHEN...From 7 PM this evening to 4 PM EST Monday.
* IMPACTS...An area of low pressure will bring a period of snowfall
to the region. Travel will be impacted due to snowfall
accumulations on roads. Periods of moderate and heavy snow will
combine with low visibility to create dangerous driving
conditions. The hazardous conditions could impact the Monday
morning commute.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling. The latest road
conditions can be obtained by going to newengland511.org</instruction>
