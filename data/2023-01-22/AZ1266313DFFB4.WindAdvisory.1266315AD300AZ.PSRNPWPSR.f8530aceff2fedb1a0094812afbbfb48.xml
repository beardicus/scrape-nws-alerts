<headline>Wind Advisory issued January 22 at 4:09AM MST until January 23 at 5:00PM MST by NWS Phoenix</headline>
<description>...HARD FREEZE WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM MST THIS
MORNING...
...WIND ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM THIS EVENING TO 5 PM
MST MONDAY...
* WHAT...For the Hard Freeze Warning, temperatures in the upper
20s to lower 30s expected. For the Wind Advisory, northwest
winds 15 to 25 mph with gusts up to 45 mph expected.
* WHERE...For the Hard Freeze Warning, central and eastern La
Paz County. For the Wind Advisory, all of La Paz County.
* WHEN...For the Hard Freeze Warning, from midnight tonight to 9
AM MST Sunday. For the Wind Advisory, from 7 PM Sunday to 5 PM
MST Monday.
* IMPACTS...For tonight and Sunday morning, temperatures low
enough to damage or even kill crops and possibly damage
unprotected outdoor plumbing. For Sunday night and Monday,
strong winds will create difficult driving conditions due to
cross-winds and pockets of blowing dust. Also, light,
unsecured objects may become airborne.</description>
<instruction>A Wind Advisory means that sustained wind speeds of between
30 and 40 mph are expected, or wind gusts of between 40 and
58 mph. Winds this strong can make driving difficult, especially
for high profile vehicles. In addition, strong winds over desert
areas could result in briefly lowered visibilities to well under
a mile at times in blowing dust or blowing sand. Use extra
caution.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
