<description>...AN AREA OF HEAVY SNOW WILL AFFECT THE AREA...
At 713 PM EST, an area of heavy snow was located along a line
extending from 8 miles northwest of Brookville to near Evans City to
8 miles southwest of Imperial. Movement was northeast at 30 mph.
Locations impacted include...
Ross Township, McCandless Township, Cranberry, Moon Township,
Weirton, Butler, Franklin Park, East Liverpool, Aliquippa, Beaver
Falls, Monaca, and Clarion.
This includes the following highways...
Pennsylvania Turnpike between mile markers 13 and 42.
Interstate 79 in Pennsylvania between mile markers 62 and 101.
Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania between mile markers 36 and 96.
Parkway North between mile markers 6 and 13.
Interstate 376 in Pennsylvania between mile markers 29 and 61.
Icy roads are possible as the snow melts on the roads then quickly
refreezes.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time when traveling.</description>
