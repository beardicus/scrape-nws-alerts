<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 14 at 9:41AM PDT until March 15 at 5:00AM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 AM PDT WEDNESDAY...
* CHANGES...Adjusted expiration time to early Wednesday morning.
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Additional snow accumulations of 2
to 6 inches below 7000 feet including Truckee and communities
at lake level, with 1 to 3 feet above 7000 feet. Sierra ridge
gusts above 100 mph with gusts up to 50 mph at lake level. Wave
heights 2 to 5 feet on Lake Tahoe.
* WHERE...Greater Lake Tahoe Area.
* WHEN...Until 5 AM PDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be very difficult to impossible with
snowfall rates 2 to 3 inches per hour at times through this
evening. Snow loading on structures will increase due to the
additional rain and snow being absorbed into the deep snowpack,
along with higher risks for dangerous roofalanches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow levels between 7000 and 8000 feet,
will begin falling during the afternoon to below 6000 feet by
late tonight. Isolated lightning is also possible during
heavier snow.</description>

an emergency kit with extra food, water and clothing. If you stay
home, have a backup plan in case of power outages.
