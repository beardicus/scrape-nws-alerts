* WHEN...Until 430 AM PDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding of roadways, creeks, and streams can be

rainfall could trigger shallow debris flows in and near recent
wildfire burn scars.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1031 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated moderate to heavy
rain moving into Los Angeles County. Overflowing poor
drainage areas will cause minor flooding in the advisory
area. Between 0.6 and 1.5 inches of rain have fallen.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 0.5 to 1.5 inches are expected
over the area. This additional rain will result in minor
flooding.
- Most of Los Angeles County.

<instruction>The rain could trigger shallow mud and debris flows, minor rock
falls, and flooding capable of localized damage, especially in steep
terrain in and near burn scars.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.</instruction>
