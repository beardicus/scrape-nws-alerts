<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 14 at 3:20AM EDT until March 15 at 8:00AM EDT by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...SIGNIFICANT WINTER STORM TODAY INTO WEDNESDAY...
.Rapidly strengthening low pressure approaches southern New England
this morning, and remains in the Gulf of Maine into tomorrow. Snow
continues overspreading the area during the morning hours today.
Greatest snowfall will likely fall at higher terrain across the
Monadnocks, Sunapee, the Ossippees, and White Mountains. At lower
elevations, heavy and wet snow is expected, likely causing scattered
power outages today and tonight. Gusty northeast to north winds of
40 to 55 mph this afternoon and evening could accentuate the power
outage risk this afternoon.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM EDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow. Additional snow accumulations between 9 and 19
inches for a storm total of 12 to 24 inches, with locally greater
than 24 inches possible across the higher terrain. Winds gusting
as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Western and Central Hillsborough, Merrimack, Sullivan, and
Cheshire Counties.
* WHEN...Until 8 AM EDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Significant snowfall and periods of heavy snowfall rates
will combine to create low visibility and very dangerous driving
conditions. The hazardous conditions will impact the morning and
evening commutes today. The strong winds and weight of snow on
tree limbs may down power lines and will likely cause power
outages.</description>
