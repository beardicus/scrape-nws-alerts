<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 14 at 9:41AM PDT until March 15 at 5:00AM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 AM PDT WEDNESDAY...
* CHANGES...Adjusted expiration time to early Wednesday morning.
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Additional snow accumulations 2 to
6 inches for communities along US-395 including Bridgeport and
Lee Vining, with 1 to 2 feet around June Lake and Mammoth
Lakes and 2 to 4 feet along the crest above 8500 feet. Sierra
ridge gusts above 100 mph.
* WHERE...Mono County.
* WHEN...Until 5 AM PDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be very difficult to impossible with
snowfall rates 2 to 3 inches per hour at times. Snow loading
on structures will increase due to the additional rain and
snow being absorbed into the deep snowpack, along with higher
risks for dangerous roofalanches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow levels will rise between 8000 to 9000
feet today, before falling tonight to below 6000 feet by early
Wednesday morning. Isolated lightning is also possible during
heavier snow.</description>
<instruction>Avoid travel if possible, you could be stuck in your vehicle for
many hours. If you must travel, prepare for long delays and carry
an emergency kit with extra food, water and clothing. If you stay
home, have a backup plan in case of power outages.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
