<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM AST SATURDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE FRIDAY
NIGHT...
* WHAT...Breaking waves of up to 10 to 13 feet. Life-threatening
rip currents.
* WHERE...Beaches of Rincon and Aguada across the western coast
of Puerto Rico, Culebra, and the northern US Virgin Islands.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 6 AM AST Saturday.
For the High Rip Current Risk, through late Friday night.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions, and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper waters. Hazardous
breaking waves.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.
A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in
the advisory area, producing localized beach erosion and
dangerous swimming conditions.</instruction>
