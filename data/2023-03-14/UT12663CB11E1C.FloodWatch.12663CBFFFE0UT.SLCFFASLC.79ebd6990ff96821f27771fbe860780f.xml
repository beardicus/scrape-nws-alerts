<headline>Flood Watch issued March 14 at 2:47PM MDT until March 15 at 12:00PM MDT by NWS Saltlake</headline>
<description>.Moderate to heavy rain will fall on a deep primed snowpack in the
headwaters of the Virgin River leading to increased snow melt and
runoff. Flows in the Subway, the Narrows and other drainages through
Zion National Park that feed into the North and East Forks of the
Virgin River may increase quickly and reach critical levels within
the park. Mainstem river flooding of the Virgin River is not
expected.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM MDT THIS EVENING THROUGH THURSDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...High flows along the Subway, Narrows, and other drainages
within Zion National Park caused by rain and snowmelt are possible.
* WHERE...Zion National Park.
* WHEN...From 9 PM MDT this evening through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff will result in high flows on all
drainages within Zion National Park. The North Fork of the Virgin
River is expect to rise above 3000 CFS, while the East Fork of the
Virgin River is expected to rise above 1200 CFS, both of which are
below mainstem river flood levels. However flows of these levels
will be dangerous to hikers and outdoor recreation within slot
canyons and normally dry washes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Heavy rain combined with mid elevation snow melt in the
headwaters of the Virgin River.

should be prepared to take action or should flooding develop, or
plan to avoid flood prone routes within the park.</instruction>
