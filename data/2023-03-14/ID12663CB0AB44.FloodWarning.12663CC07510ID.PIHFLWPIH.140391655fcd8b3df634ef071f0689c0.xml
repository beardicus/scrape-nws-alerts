<description>...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON MDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by avalanches along the Big Wood River near
Hailey blocking the river. Rain and snowmelt may lead to
additional areas of standing water or flooding.

* WHEN...Until noon MDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding along the Big Wood River and nearby low-lying

of slow moving or standing water. Release of the snow and ice
blockage in the river could result in sudden rises of water,
leading to rapidly rising water downstream of the blockage.

from an avalanche blocking the Wood River near Hailey.

the Big Wood River upstream of the Broadford Bridge. In
