<headline>Flood Watch issued March 14 at 2:35AM MST  by NWS Flagstaff</headline>
<description>.Heavy rain may fall on a deep primed snowpack leading to the melt
increasing. Flows in rivers may increase quickly and reach critical
levels.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY MORNING THROUGH THURSDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of central Arizona, including the lower
elevations of Yavapai County and northern Gila County.
* WHEN...From Wednesday morning through Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Flooding will be possible in creeks, normally dry
washes, and swimming holes. Low-water crossings could also
experience flooding, which would create deadly travel conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Periods of heavy rainfall are expected to develop across the
region starting Wednesday and lasting into early Thursday.
The rain combined with snow melt, will lead to significant
runoff into area waterways. With many waterways south of the
Mogollon Rim already seeing elevated flow, several locations
may approach or exceed flood stage. The greatest chances for
flood exist within the Oak Creek, Sycamore Creek, Beaver
Creek, and Verde River basins.
- Visit www.weather.gov/safety/flood for more information on
flood safety.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
