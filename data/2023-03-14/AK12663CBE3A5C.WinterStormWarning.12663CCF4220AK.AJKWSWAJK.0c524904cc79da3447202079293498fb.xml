<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 14 at 10:39PM AKDT until March 16 at 10:00AM AKDT by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...Snow Followed by Heavy Rain for Southeast Alaska...
.Snow arrives to the central and northern Panhandle late Tuesday
night through Thursday. Confidence is increasing that the far
northern Panhandle, including Haines and Skagway, will see heavy
snow while warming temperatures change snow over to rain for the
Icy Strait Corridor. Precipitation is still expected to start as
snow along the Icy Strait Corridor, but a general 2 to 4 inches
is expected as a change to rain should limit any significant
accumulations. As for Yakutat, the main plume of moisture is
expected to develop to the east limiting snow accumulations. That
being said, by Thursday evening, the main plume of moisture is
expected to shift to west, increasing the possibility for Yakutat
to see significant snow accumulations. Yakutat`s snow
accumulations will be extremely dependent on where the plume of
moisture develops so this trend will be monitored closely
throughout this event.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 AM WEDNESDAY TO
10 AM AKDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow followed by heavy rain expected. Total snow
accumulations of 7 to 14 inches. Winds gusting as high as 35
mph.
* WHERE...Municipality of Skagway and Haines Borough and Klukwan.
* WHEN...From 7 AM Wednesday to 10 AM AKDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Heaviest snowfall rates are expected
Wednesday night. A transition to heavy rain near sea level is
expected by Thursday morning.</description>
