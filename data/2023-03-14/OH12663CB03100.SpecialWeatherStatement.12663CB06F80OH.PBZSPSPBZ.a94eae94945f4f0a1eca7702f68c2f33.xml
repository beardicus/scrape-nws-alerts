<description>...SCATTERED MODERATE TO HEAVY SNOW SHOWERS CAUSING BRIEF
VISIBILITY REDUCTION...
Snow showers continue to track across portions of far eastern
Ohio, the northern West Virginia panhandle, and portions of
southwest Pennsylvania south of Pittsburgh. Some of these snow
showers are creating brief periods of moderate to heavy snow, and
will continue to track southeastward across the region through
noon.
Visibility of below one-half mile may be observed in the heavier
snow showers. Also, a quick coating of one-half to one inch may be
received, which could cause untreated roads to become snow-
covered.
If you are driving this morning, be prepared for low visibility
and slippery roads. Slow down, allow for extra travel time, and
increase the distance between your car and those that surround
you</description>
