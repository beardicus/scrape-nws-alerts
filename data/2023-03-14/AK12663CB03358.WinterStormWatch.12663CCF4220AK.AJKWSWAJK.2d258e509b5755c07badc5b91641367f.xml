<description>...Heavy Snow Followed by Rain for Northern Panhandle...
.Snow arrives to the northern Panhandle late Tuesday night
through Thursday. Although this is a high confidence
precipitation forecast, there is low confidence in timing of
precipitation changing from snow to rain as models continue to
struggle resolving multiple low pressure systems in the Gulf and
associated plumes of moisture. Precipitation will begin as snow,
but the uncertainty revolves around how much moisture will be
associated with each surge of energy and on how fast temperatures
warm. For now, the current forecast represents the lower end of
snow accumulation ranges, but there does exist a less than
20 percent probability that snow accumulations could reach the
higher end of the forecast ranges.
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY MORNING
THROUGH THURSDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Total snow accumulations of 8 to 16 inches possible.
* WHERE...Municipality of Skagway, Haines Borough and Klukwan.
* WHEN...From Wednesday morning through Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Heaviest snow rates are expected
Wednesday night through early Thursday morning before changing
to rain.</description>
