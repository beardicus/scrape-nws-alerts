<headline>Wind Advisory issued March 14 at 9:41AM PDT until March 14 at 11:00PM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WIND ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM PDT THIS EVENING...
* CHANGES...Increased winds and added blowing dust.
* WHAT...South winds 25 to 35 mph with gusts up to 55 mph
expected. Wind prone areas including US-395 north of Reno, I-
580 from south Reno to Carson City and US-95 near Walker Lake
could see gusts above 60 mph. Waves 2 to 5 feet on Pyramid
Lake.
* WHERE...Surprise Valley California, Western Nevada Basin and
Range including Pyramid Lake, Greater Reno-Carson City-Minden
Area, Mineral and Southern Lyon Counties and Northern Washoe
County.
* WHEN...Until 11 PM PDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Gusty winds could blow down tree limbs and a few power
outages may result. Travel will be difficult, especially for
high profile vehicles. Patchy blowing dust could reduce
visibility at times to less than one mile. Lake waters will be
rough and small boats, kayaks and paddle boards will be prone to
capsizing.</description>
<instruction>Now is the time to secure loose outdoor items such as patio
furniture and trash cans before winds increase which could blow
these items away. The best thing to do is prepare ahead of time
by making sure you have extra food and water on hand, flashlights
with spare batteries and/or candles in the event of a power
outage.</instruction>
