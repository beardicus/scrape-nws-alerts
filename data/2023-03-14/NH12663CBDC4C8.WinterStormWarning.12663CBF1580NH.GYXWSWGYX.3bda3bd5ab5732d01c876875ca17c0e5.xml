<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 14 at 11:38PM EDT until March 15 at 8:00AM EDT by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...SIGNIFICANT WINTER STORM CONTINUES TONIGHT...
.Low pressure over the Gulf of Maine will continue to produce snow
along with strong, gusty winds through tonight. Additional snowfall
accumulations will be relatively minor compared with the snow we`ve
experienced thus far, with most snow being light to at times
moderate in intensity, however snowfall accumulated on trees and
power lines combined with wind may still lead to additional power
outages. Travel will continue to be hazardous due to areas of
blowing snow as well. Snow will continue to diminish in coverage and
intensity through Wednesday morning, with light showers persisting
over the mountains through the day. Winds on the other hand will
remain gusty through Wednesday with gusts to around 30-35 mph.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM EDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy, wet snow and blowing snow. Additional snow
accumulations up to 4 inches. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Northern Carroll, Northern Grafton, and Southern Grafton
Counties.
* WHEN...Until 8 AM EDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Light to moderate snow along with blowing snow will
combine to create low visibility and dangerous driving conditions.
Gusty winds combined with the weight of snow will likely bring
down some tree branches and lead to power outages.</description>
