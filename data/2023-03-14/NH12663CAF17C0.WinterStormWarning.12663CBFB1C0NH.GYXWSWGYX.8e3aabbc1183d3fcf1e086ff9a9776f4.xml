<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 14 at 3:20AM EDT until March 15 at 12:00PM EDT by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...SIGNIFICANT WINTER STORM TODAY INTO WEDNESDAY...
.Rapidly strengthening low pressure approaches southern New England
this morning, and remains in the Gulf of Maine into tomorrow. Snow
continues overspreading the area during the morning hours today.
Greatest snowfall will likely fall at higher terrain across the
Monadnocks, Sunapee, the Ossippees, and White Mountains. At lower
elevations, heavy and wet snow is expected, likely causing scattered
power outages today and tonight. Gusty northeast to north winds of
40 to 55 mph this afternoon and evening could accentuate the power
outage risk this afternoon.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON EDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 8 and
12 inches. Winds gusting as high as 55 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of southwest Maine. Portions of central,
northern, and southern New Hampshire.
* WHEN...Until Noon EDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Significant snowfall and periods of heavy snowfall rates
will combine to create low visibility and very dangerous driving
conditions. The hazardous conditions are likely to impact the
morning commute across southern New Hampshire, with widespread
impacts to the evening commute expected in all areas. The strong
winds and weight of snow on tree limbs will likely lead to downed
power lines and power outages. A period of damaging winds is
possible late this afternoon and evening, which combined with the
wet snow could enhance power outages.</description>
