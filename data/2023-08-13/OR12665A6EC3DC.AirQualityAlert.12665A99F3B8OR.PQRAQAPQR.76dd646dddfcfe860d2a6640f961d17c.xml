<headline>Air Quality Alert issued August 13 at 10:27AM PDT  by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...AIR QUALITY ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM PDT TUESDAY...
The Lane Regional Air Protection Agency has issued an Air Quality
Advisory, which is in effect until 5 PM Tuesday afternoon.
An Air Quality Advisory for smoke has been issued. Wildfires burning
in the region combined with forecasted conditions will cause air
quality to reach unhealthy levels at times through Sunday.
Protect yourself and your family when smoke levels are high:
Stay inside if possible. Keep windows and doors closed. If it’s too
hot, run air conditioning on recirculate or consider moving to a
cooler location. Avoid strenuous outdoor activity. Use high-
efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters in indoor ventilation
systems or portable air purifiers. Or create your own air purifying
filter by following these instructions. Be aware of smoke in your
area and avoid places with the highest levels. When air quality
improves to moderate or healthy (yellow or green on the Air Quality
Index), open windows and doors to air out homes and businesses. If
you have a breathing plan for a medical condition, be sure to follow
it and keep any needed medications refilled.
Cloth, dust and surgical masks don’t protect from the harmful
particles in smoke. N95 or P100 respirators approved by NIOSH may
offer protection, but they must be properly selected and worn. Select
a NIOSH-approved respirator with a N, R or P alongside the number
95, 99 or 100. Learn how to put on and use a respirator. Respirators
won’t work for children as they don’t come in children’s sizes.
People with heart or lung conditions should consult their health care
provider before wearing a respirator.
