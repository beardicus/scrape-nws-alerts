<description>...Mendenhall Lake is Rising...
Mendenhall Lake continues to rise this evening. Here is what we
know. Lake levels were steady around 7 ft, but began to rise
around 5 AM AKDT Sunday morning and are now approaching 8 ft.
Latest webcam image from Suicide Basin indicates that the basin is
still rising. This tells us that the most likely reason for the
rising lake level is due to runoff from heavy rainfall as well as
increased upper elevation ice melt.
With limited data to work with, initial estimates suggest that
the lake will continue to rise just above 8 ft before lowering
back below 8 ft early Monday morning. Continue to monitor
www.weather.gov/juneau for any additional updates.</description>
