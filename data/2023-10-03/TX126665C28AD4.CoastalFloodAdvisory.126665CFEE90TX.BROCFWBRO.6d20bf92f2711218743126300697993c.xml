<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued October 03 at 4:25PM CDT until October 04 at 4:00AM CDT by NWS Brownsville</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IS NOW EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM CDT

* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding.
For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Kenedy Island, Willacy Island and Cameron Island
Counties.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 4 AM CDT
Wednesday. For the High Rip Current Risk, through Wednesday

* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding is expected, with water reaching
or pushing into the dunes on South Padre Island. Vehicles,
except those with four wheel drive and high wheel bases, will
be unable to be driven on the beach. This includes locations
north of Public Beach Access #3. Minor to moderate beach
erosion is expected. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
