Wisconsin, mostly north of Interstate 94, a brief break of an hour
or two from the precipitation can be expected. Another area of
snow to a wintry mix is quickly rotating northward out of Iowa
however, returning one more round of precipitation. This area of
mainly snow looks to shift north of Interstate 90 by mid morning,
exiting into northern Wisconsin toward noon.
Winds will continue drift snow, especially on ridge tops, higher
terrain and open areas.

and west central Wisconsin.

* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Patchy blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions
will impact the morning commute.</description>
