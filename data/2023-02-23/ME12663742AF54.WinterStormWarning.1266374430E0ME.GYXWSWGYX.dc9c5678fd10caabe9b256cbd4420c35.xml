.Snow, heavy at times, will continue this morning before tapering
off late morning. Sleet will mix in across far southern NH, also

will be possible this afternoon before another period of snow and
mixed precipitation arrives this evening.

accumulations up to one tenth of an inch.
* WHERE...Portions of southwest Maine. Portions of central and
northern New Hampshire.

* IMPACTS...A snowstorm will bring plowable snow to the region with

snow and low visibility will be the biggest hazards. The potential
exists for snowbands that will bring periods of locally heavy
