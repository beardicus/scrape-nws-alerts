<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued February 23 at 9:46PM AKST until February 25 at 9:00AM AKST by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...SNOW BEGINNING THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH SATURDAY...
.A strengthening low with embedded waves and an associated front
will move over the panhandle Friday. Dry snow will spread from
north to south across the panhandle. The snow will largely fall in
two separate waves. A first, and weaker, wave will move through
by early Friday morning. A brief lull may be possible Friday
morning for some locations before a much stronger wave moves into
the panhandle, bringing with it substantially more snow. Some
uncertainty exists regarding snow totals due to limited moisture
available, particularly for parts of the northern and central
inner channels. For most areas the greatest snowfall rates will be
Friday evening through early Saturday morning.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM AKST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 9 to
15 inches.
* WHERE...City and Borough of Juneau, Gustavus, and Glacier Bay.
* WHEN...From midnight tonight to 9 AM AKST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be very difficult due to reduced
visibility and blowing snow. The hazardous conditions could
impact the Friday morning and Friday evening commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Light, dry snow will fall Thursday night
resulting in moderate snow accumulations. A brief lull in the
snow may occur Friday morning before the second, stronger, wave
arrives. The greatest snowfall rates are expected with this
second wave Friday afternoon through Friday night before rates
begin to diminish early Saturday morning.</description>
