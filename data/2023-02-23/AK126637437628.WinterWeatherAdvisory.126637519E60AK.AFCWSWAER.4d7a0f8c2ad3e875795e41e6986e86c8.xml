<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued February 23 at 4:22AM AKST until February 23 at 9:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM AKST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Snow and rain expected. Total snow accumulations around 2
inches in town and 6 to 10 inches at higher elevations. Winds
gusting as high as 25 mph in town and 40 mph at higher
elevations.
* WHERE...Anchorage.
* WHEN...From 3 AM to 9 PM AKST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning and afternoon commutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Periods of snow will mix with rain this
morning and afternoon as southeast winds develop over town. The
winds will diminish by late afternoon turning precipitation
back to all snow. Higher elevations will see more snow than in
the Anchorage bowl and the snow and wind at higher elevations
may limit visibility at times. There remains a chance the
southeast winds will not be sufficient to turn the snow to rain,
which would increase snow amounts over the Anchorage Bowl.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
