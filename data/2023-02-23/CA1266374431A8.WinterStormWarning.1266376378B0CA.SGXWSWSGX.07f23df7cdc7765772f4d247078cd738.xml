* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. The

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...More widespread and heavier precipitation
is expected to develop on Friday and continue into Saturday.
Snow levels will rise to around 5500 feet Friday night, then
fall to around 3500 feet Saturday. The combination of very
heavy snow, low visibilities from snow, blowing snow, and fog,
