is expected to develop on Friday and continue into Saturday.
Snow levels will rise to around 5500 to 6000 feet Friday
night, then fall to around 4000 feet Saturday. The combination
of very heavy snow, low visibilities from snow, blowing snow,

is expected Friday night into Saturday morning.</description>
