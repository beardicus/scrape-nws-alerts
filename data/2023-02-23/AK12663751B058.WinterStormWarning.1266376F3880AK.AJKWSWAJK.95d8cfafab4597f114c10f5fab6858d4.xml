<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued February 23 at 9:46PM AKST until February 25 at 3:00PM AKST by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...SNOW BEGINNING THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH SATURDAY...
.A strengthening low with embedded waves and an associated front
will move over the panhandle Friday. Dry snow will spread from
north to south across the panhandle. The snow will largely fall in
two separate waves. A first, and weaker, wave will move through
by early Friday morning. A brief lull may be possible Friday
morning for some locations before a much stronger wave moves into
the panhandle, bringing with it substantially more snow. Some
uncertainty exists regarding snow totals due to limited moisture
available, particularly for parts of the northern and central
inner channels. For most areas the greatest snowfall rates will be
Friday evening through early Saturday morning.

3 PM AKST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 11 to
14 inches.

rates Friday night.</description>
