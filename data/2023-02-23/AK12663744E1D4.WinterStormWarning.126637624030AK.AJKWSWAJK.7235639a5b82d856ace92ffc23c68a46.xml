<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued February 23 at 1:53PM AKST until February 25 at 6:00AM AKST by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...SNOW BEGINNING THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH SATURDAY...
.A strengthening low with embedded waves will move into the NE gulf
Thursday evening with an associated front moving over the panhandle
Friday. Dry snow will spread from north to south across the
panhandle. The snow will largely fall in two separate waves. A
first, and weaker, wave will move through during Thursday night
and early Friday morning. A brief lull may be possible Friday
morning for some locations before a much stronger wave moves into
the panhandle, bringing with it substantially more snow. Some
uncertainty exists regarding snow totals due to limited moisture
available, particularly for parts of the northern and central
inner channels. For most areas the greatest snowfall rates will be
Friday evening through early Saturday morning.
