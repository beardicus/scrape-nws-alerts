<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued October 05 at 8:32PM EDT until October 06 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM EDT FRIDAY THROUGH
FRIDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Dangerous rip currents and large breaking waves
expected in the surf zone.
* WHERE...For the dangerous rip currents, all Hatteras Island
beaches. For large breaking waves, beaches north of Cape
Hatteras.
* WHEN...From 8 AM EDT Friday through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw
a swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom causing neck
and back injuries.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most likely time for strong rip
currents to occur is a couple hours either side of low tide,
which will occur around 7:15 AM and 8:45 PM Friday.</description>
<instruction>Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
