<description>...BANKFULL CONDITIONS FOR SOME RIVERS AND STREAMS ACROSS UPPER LYNN
CANAL...
Very warm temperatures across the region from late June through
early July prompted bankful conditions in some area rivers and
streams. This may cause some periodic impacts along the lower Taiya
River near the Chilkoot Trail and along the Chilkat River northwest
of Haines through Wednesday evening.
Hikers on the Chilkoot Trail should note that water could
periodically begin to inundate the trail with water through
Wednesday evening.
For the Chilkat River, areas around mile post 14 and 16 of the
Haines Highway are the most likely places to experience minor
flooding should it occur.
Temperatures will drop to more normal levels late this week allowing
river levels to drop as well.
For Chilkat River at Klukwan:
At 8:00pm the stage was 126.25 feet.
Flood Stage is 128.0 feet.
Forecast: A crest around 126.7 feet is expected around 10:00am
Wednesday. River levels should begin to fall more noticeably
thereafter.
Impacts:
At 127.0 feet: This is bankfull stage, but water can encroach the
Haines Highway, south of Klukwan.  Note that the Chilkat River is
highly braided, if and when it shifts channels, our present bankfull
and flood stages will be outdated.
...
For Taiya River near Skagway:
At 8:00pm the stage was 15.97 feet.
Flood Stage is 16.5 feet.
Forecast: A crest around 16.3 feet is expected around 10:00pm
Tuesday with another similar crest around 10pm Wednesday.
Impacts:
At 16.1 feet: Portions of the Chilkoot Trail begins to inundate with
water.</description>
