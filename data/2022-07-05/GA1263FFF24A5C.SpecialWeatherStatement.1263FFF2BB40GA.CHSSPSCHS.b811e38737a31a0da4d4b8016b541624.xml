<description>...BRIEF WATERSPOUTS COULD IMPACT THE BEACHES THIS MORNING...
Conditions are favorable for the development of waterspouts across
the waters this morning. As building clouds and isolated showers
move onshore, there is a chance for any waterspouts that form to
approach the beaches. Those heading to area beaches this morning
should remain weather aware and be prepared to take shelter if a
waterspout approaches. Waterspouts that move onshore become
tornadoes.
Although most waterspouts are weak and dissipate quickly after
moving onshore, they can still cause damage. Be prepared to take
quick action if the waterspout approaches your location. Move to
an interior room and away from windows.</description>
