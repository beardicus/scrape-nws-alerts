AIR QUALITY ADVISORY
VALID TIME: Tuesday July 5, 2022 2:00 PM to Friday July 8, 2022
2:00 PM, advisory will be issued until end of the event.
TIME/DATE OF THE NEXT REPORT: Friday July 8, 2022 2:00 PM, if
needed.
ADVISORY: The Lime Complex fires have seen some precipitation the
past few days. The current high RH and cloud cover is keeping the
fires from significant growth. Wetting rains are in the forecast
for the next few days that may put an end to large smoke producing
fires. Currently there is still smoke in the area, trapped under
the low clouds along the Alaska Range. The Air Quality will vary
between GOOD and UNHEALTHY depending on wind flow and proximity to
the fires.
Be aware that areas immediately downwind of any fire will
experience HAZARDOUS levels of smoke. Generally, worse conditions
occur overnight and during the early morning hours, as the
atmosphere cools and brings smoke to the surface. During the day,
surface heating will mix smoke and carry it upwards, temporarily
improving air quality.
SMOKE AND PUBLIC IMPACT: This is an area forecast, and as such is
a general forecast for portions of Southwestern Interior Alaska.
Smoke intensity will vary depending on precise location and local
wind flow patterns. Smoke concentrations will be such that they
could impact public health at times. It is advised that travelers
check local weather as smoke conditions may vary considerably from
one locality to the next. The most recent weather observations
for the surrounding impacted areas may be found on the Federal
Aviation Administration Weather Cams homepage at
https://weathercams.faa.gov/.
In smoke impacted areas, DEC advises people with respiratory or
heart disease, the elderly and children should avoid prolonged
exertion; everyone else should limit prolonged exertion.

Mark Smith with the Division of Air Quality at 907-269-7676.</description>
