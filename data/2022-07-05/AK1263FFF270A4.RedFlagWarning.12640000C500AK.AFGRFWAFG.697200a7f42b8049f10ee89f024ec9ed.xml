A thermal low pressure trough that extends from Northway to
Anaktuvuk Pass will move to Northway to Arctic Village this
afternoon and remain there through Wednesday, before spreading
slowly west on Thursday. This trough combined with a warm and
unstable airmass will cause isolated thunderstorms to continue
over the Eastern Interior through Thursday. Areas south of Ft
Yukon can expect scattered thunderstorms with gusty winds, hail,
and frequent lightning in the afternoon and evening today and
Wednesday. Expect 3000-5000 lightning strokes today with most of
them from Ft Yukon south to the Alaska Range. Wednesday should see
similar conditions.
Min RH should be 25-40% across the Eastern Interior today, with
the driest conditions along the Alaska Highway. The Eastern Interior
should remain warmer than normal and relatively dry from Wednesday
through the end of the week.
