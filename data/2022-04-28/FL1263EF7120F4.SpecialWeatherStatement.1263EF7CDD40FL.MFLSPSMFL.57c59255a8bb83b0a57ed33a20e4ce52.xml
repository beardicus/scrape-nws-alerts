<headline>Special Weather Statement issued April 28 at 7:09PM EDT  by NWS Miami</headline>
<description>...Strong thunderstorms will impact portions of northeastern Collier
and southern Hendry Counties through 800 PM EDT...
At 709 PM EDT, National Weather Service meteorologists were tracking
strong thunderstorms capable of producing a landspout along a line
extending from near Felda to near Big Cypress Seminole Reservation.
These storms were nearly stationary.
HAZARD...Landspouts, wind gusts of 50 to 55 mph, and penny size
hail.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Minor damage to outdoor objects is possible. Gusty winds
could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured
objects.
Locations impacted include...
Ave Maria, Immokalee, Hendry Correctional, Felda, Big Cypress
Seminole Reservation, Big Cypress National Preserve, Keri, Sunniland,
Bunker Hill and Lake Trafford.
LANDSPOUT...POSSIBLE
MAX HAIL SIZE...0.75 IN
MAX WIND GUST...55 MPH</description>
<instruction>Conditions are favorable for the development of weak, brief funnel
clouds. This type of funnel cloud is harmless, but on rare occasions
they can briefly touch down, producing wind gusts over 50 mph. If a
funnel cloud is spotted move indoors and report your sighting to the
National Weather Service.
Torrential rainfall is also occurring with these storms and may lead
to localized flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flooded
roadways.
Persons participating in outdoor activities should seek sturdy
shelter until these storms pass. Open shelters found in parks,
beaches, or golf courses offer no protection from the dangers of
lightning.</instruction>
