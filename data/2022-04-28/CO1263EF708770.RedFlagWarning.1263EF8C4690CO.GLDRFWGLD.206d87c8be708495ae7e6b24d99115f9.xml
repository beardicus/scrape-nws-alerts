Wichita.
* Winds...Northwest 25 to 35 mph with gusts up to 45 mph.

* Impacts...Any fires that start will have extreme fire behavior
and spread rapidly. Outdoor burning is not advised.
* Additional Details... Winds will be from the west during the
morning hours before becoming northwesterly during the early
afternoon hours behind the cold front. This may cause any fires
to rapidly change direction. Any county surrounding the Red Flag
Warning will still have the potential for a brief period of
critical fire weather conditions through the afternoon. Any
burning is strongly discouraged Friday.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
