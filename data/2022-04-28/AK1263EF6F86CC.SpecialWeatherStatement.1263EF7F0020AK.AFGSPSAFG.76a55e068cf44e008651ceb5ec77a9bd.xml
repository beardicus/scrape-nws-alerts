<description>...Increased Snowmelt Continues Across The Southeast Interior
Through The Weekend...
Warmer temperatures this weekend will cause increased melting of
the snowpack across the Southeast Interior, with the amount of
melt water increasing dramatically. Today and Friday will see
highs in the 40s to upper 50s, with temperatures this weekend in
the 50s to around 60, while overnight lows will only fall to
around freezing for much of the area.
The warm temperatures will continue the rapid melting of the
snowpack that we have seen for the last few days. Snow will melt
quickest on south facing slopes and around buildings and pavement.
Most of the Southeast Interior still has a significant amount of
water in the saturated snow pack that has not been released.
Water will continue to pond in low lying areas, and could get
deeper in areas where drainages remain frozen or drainage is poor.
People in low lying or poorly drained areas should prepare for
potential flooding that could develop as the snowmelt accelerates.
Preparations include clearing ice out of drain pipes, culverts
and drainage ditches. Preparations also include moving vehicles to
higher ground, and moving valuables in basements and garages to
shelves above the ground.
Water is making its way into the water system and overflow can be
found on many of the still frozen lakes, ponds, streams, and
rivers.
