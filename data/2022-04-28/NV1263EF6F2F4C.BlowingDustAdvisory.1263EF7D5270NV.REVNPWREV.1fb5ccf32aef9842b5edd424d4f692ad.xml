THIS EVENING...
...LAKE WIND ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO 8 PM
PDT THIS EVENING FOR PYRAMID LAKE...
* WHAT...For the Blowing Dust Advisory, visibility between 1 and 3
miles with occasional reductions below 1 mile expected. For the
Lake Wind Advisory, west winds 15 to 25 mph with gusts up to 40
mph expected. Waves 2 to 4 feet.
* WHERE...Western Nevada Basin and Range including Pyramid Lake.
* WHEN...From noon today to 8 PM PDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous driving conditions could be encountered on
portions of I-80 and US-95 due to reduced visibility. Small
boats, kayaks, and paddle boards will be prone to capsizing and
should remain off lake waters until conditions improve.</description>
<instruction>Be prepared for sudden decreases in visibility to less than 1
mile, and even briefly down to a few hundred yards. If you
encounter an area of blowing dust, slow down and leave plenty of
space between you and the car in front of you.
Check lake conditions before heading out and be prepared for a
sudden increase in winds and wave heights. Consider postponing
boating activities on the lake until a day with less wind.</instruction>
