<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 345 AM CDT FRIDAY FOR
NORTHERN PHILLIPS COUNTY...
At 1142 PM CDT, Doppler radar indicated that thunderstorms from
earlier in the night had ended within the area. However, radar

Thursday afternoon and evening. As a result, Flash flooding may
still be ongoing due to continued runoff.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.

IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,
highways, streets and underpasses as well as other poor
drainage and low-lying areas.
Some locations that could experience flash flooding include...
Long Island and Woodruff, but mainly rural areas of northern
Phillips County, including the Highway 183 corridor.
This includes, but is not limited to, the following streams and
drainages...
West Cedar Creek, West Middle Cedar Creek, Spring Creek, Prairie
Dog Creek, Plotner Creek, West Plum Creek, Deer Creek, Middle
Cedar Creek, Big Creek, Walnut Creek and Crystal Creek.
