<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT DUE TO ELEVATED PARTICLE POLLUTION LEVELS FROM
WINDBLOWN DUST IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST TUESDAY...
The South Coast AQMD has issued an air quality alert due to increased
particle pollution from blowing dust. The air quality alert is in
effect tomorrow.
In areas directly impacted by high levels of windblown dust, limit your
exposure by remaining indoors with windows and doors closed and
avoiding vigorous physical activity. Run your air conditioner or an
air purifier. If temperatures allow, avoid using whole house fans or
swamp coolers that bring in outside air.
Exposure to high particle pollution levels can cause serious health
problems, including asthma attacks, heart and lung disease symptoms,
and increased risk of respiratory infections. People with heart or
lung diseases should follow their doctor`s advice for dealing with
episodes of unhealthy air quality. Children, older adults, and people
with respiratory or heart disease should avoid prolonged exposure
and strenuous activities when particle pollution levels are high.
To help minimize outdoor particle pollution levels:
• Carpool, telecommute, reduce trips, or take public transportation
• Slow down if driving on dirt roads
• Stabilize loose soils
Levels of particle pollution can vary hour by hour and by location
depending on wind conditions.
To view current and forecasted air quality levels, visit the South
Coast Air Quality Management District website at aqmd.gov or download
the mobile app at www.aqmd.gov/mobileapp. Additional details for this
air quality alert may be available at www.aqmd.gov/advisory.</description>
