* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...With temperatures near or slightly below
freezing, roads will be slippery in spots, especially in
outlying valleys. Untreated bridges and overpasses are most
likely become icy. The rapid changes in visibility and

<instruction>If driving, slow down, use your headlights, and leave plenty of
distance ahead of you. Cyclists and pedestrians should wear
bright or reflective clothing to improve the chances of being
seen by others in dense fog.
People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with high levels of air pollution during
periods of stagnant air.
State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor
burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be
limited as much as possible. According to state air quality
agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants
close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with
your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
