with light winds is expected. For the Dense Fog Advisory,
visibility one quarter mile or less in areas of dense fog.
* WHERE...Valleys in the Lane County Cascade Foothills.
* WHEN...For the Air Stagnation Advisory, until 10 PM PST
Tuesday. For the Dense Fog Advisory, until 10 AM PST this

* IMPACTS...Hazardous driving conditions due to low visibility.
Air stagnation could result in the development and persistence
of poor air quality.</description>
<instruction>If driving, slow down, use your headlights, and leave plenty of
distance ahead of you. Cyclists and pedestrians should wear
bright or reflective clothing to improve the chances of being
seen by others in dense fog.
People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with high levels of air pollution during
periods of stagnant air.
State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor
burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be
limited as much as possible. According to state air quality
agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants
close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with
your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
