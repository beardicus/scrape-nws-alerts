<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM AKST THIS
EVENING THROUGH THOMPSON PASS...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions occurring. Winds gusting as high as
70 mph. Visibility reduced to as low as one quarter mile.
* WHERE...Thompson Pass.
* WHEN...Until 9 PM AKST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be difficult. Very strong winds could
cause damage, power outages, and difficulty for high profile
vehicles.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Reduced visibilities are being caused by
winds lifting and blowing transportable snow already on the
ground. Winds will gradually diminish this evening, leading to
improving conditions. However, there is a chance for some light
falling snow tonight, which could lead to lower visibilities
once again as some wind will persist.</description>
<instruction>A Blizzard Warning means severe winter weather conditions are
expected or occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds
and poor visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout
conditions, making travel very hazardous. If you must travel,
have a winter survival kit with you.If you get stranded, stay
with your vehicle.
For the latest road conditions call 5 1 1 or visit
