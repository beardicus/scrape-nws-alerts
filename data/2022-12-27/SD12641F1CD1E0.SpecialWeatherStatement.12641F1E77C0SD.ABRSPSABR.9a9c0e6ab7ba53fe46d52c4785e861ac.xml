<description>...LOCALIZED BLOWING AND DRIFTING SNOW TO CONTINUE TONIGHT...
Locally strong and gusty winds will continue along the eastern
slopes of the Sisseton Hills tonight, especially south of
Watertown exit 177 on Interstate 29. South to southwest winds of
15 to 30 mph with occasional gusts over 35 mph are likely.
Locations that could be affected include the higher terrain areas
of the Sisseton Hills as well as up to 15 miles east of the hills.
This includes Interstate 29 between Summit and Peever, or between
mile markers 210 and 225. U.S. Highway 12 from Summit to Milbank
may also experience strong winds, as well as roadways across much
of Deuel County. The strong winds will promote blowing and
drifting snow, along with low visibility at times. Anyone with
travel plans across far northeast South Dakota should be prepared
for inclement weather and are urged to slow down and allow for
extra distance between vehicles if need be, especially along I-29
between Peever and the exit for Estelline and Toronto. Downslope
winds are forecast to diminish by early Wednesday morning.</description>
