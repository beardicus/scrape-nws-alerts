between Virgina Lakes to the north to Bishop Creek to the south.
* WHEN...10 AM PST Tuesday to 7 AM PST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...A large atmospheric river will bring periods of heavy
rain on snow below treeline stressing an already weak snowpack.
Strong winds and heavy snowfall at higher elevations will also
create widespread areas of unstable snow.

conditions. Travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended.
Avalanches may run long distances and can run into lower
elevations.
