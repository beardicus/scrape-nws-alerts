including the following areas, in northwest Oregon, Coast Range of
Northwest Oregon and North Oregon Coast. In southwest Washington,
South Washington Coast and Willapa Hills.
* WHEN...Through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in additional flooding of
rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone
locations. Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rainfall totals in the past 24 hours are 2 to 4 inches for
the Coast, Coast Range, Willapa Hills and Cascades, with 1 to
3 inches for inland valleys. Expect an additional 1 to 2.5
