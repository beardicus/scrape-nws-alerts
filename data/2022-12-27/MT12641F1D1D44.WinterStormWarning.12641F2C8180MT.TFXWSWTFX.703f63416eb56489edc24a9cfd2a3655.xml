<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued December 27 at 8:13PM MST until December 28 at 9:00PM MST by NWS GreatFalls</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM MST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Snow, mixing with rain at times, especially at and below
pass level. Additional snow accumulations between 3 and 6 inches
up to pass level, with up to 16 inches in the mountains.
* WHERE...The Continental Divide along the Rocky Mountain Front.
* WHEN...Until 9 PM MST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Visibilities may drop below 1/4 mile due to falling and
blowing snow. Travel could be very difficult, and tire chains may
be required for some vehicles. Those in the backcountry should
ensure they are prepared for dangerous conditions. Widespread
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. Very strong
winds could cause extensive damage to trees and power lines.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Winds will increase significantly through
late tonight, with sustained speeds of between 35 to 50 mph and
gusts as high as 70 mph expected. Travel on United States Highway
2 between East Glacier and Marias Pass will become especially
hazardous, as the combination of falling and blowing snow cause
low visibility.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road conditions can
be obtained by calling 5 1 1 or visiting the MDT Road Report website.</instruction>
