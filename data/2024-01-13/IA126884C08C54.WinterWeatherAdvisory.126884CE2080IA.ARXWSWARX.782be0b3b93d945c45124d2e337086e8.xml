<description>...Light Snow and Slick Travel Followed by Bitter Cold...
.The strong winter storm will continue to pull away today, but
lingering light snow may produce up to an inch or two of
additional snowfall for some areas. In addition, gusty winds will
lead to some blowing and drifting, particularly across open areas
of southeast Minnesota and northeast Iowa. Be prepared for slick,
hazardous travel conditions today before conditions gradually
improve. Many untreated roads remain slick or snow-covered.
Bitterly cold air will impact the region tonight into the start of
the new week with wind chill values 20 below to 35 below zero.
Limit time outdoors, if possible.
