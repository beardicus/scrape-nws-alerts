<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 13 at 2:38AM EST until January 15 at 1:00PM EST by NWS Buffalo</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM THIS
AFTERNOON TO 1 PM EST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy lake effect snow and strong winds expected. Total
snow accumulations of 1 to 2 feet in the most persistent lake
snows, with local amounts of 2 to 3 feet possible where bands
persist the longest. Winds gusting as high as 60 mph early in
the event will diminish somewhat by Sunday morning. Blizzard
conditions will be possible at times, especially tonight
through Sunday.
* WHERE...The Eastern Lake Ontario Region. Greatest snow amounts
will be from the Tug Hill northward across Jefferson and
northern Lewis counties.
* WHEN...From 4 PM Saturday to 1 PM EST Monday. The band of
heavy lake effect snow is expected to oscillate north and
south several times through the course of the event, resulting
in varying conditions over time.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be very difficult to impossible with deep
snow cover on roads. Widespread blowing snow will reduce
visibility to near zero in lake effect bands. Strong winds
could cause tree and powerline damage.</description>
<instruction>Heavy snow will fall in relatively narrow bands and this combined
with blowing snow will reduce visibility to near zero. Travel will
be extremely difficult to impossible in heavy lake effect bands.
Travel within lake effect bands will be extremely dangerous
tonight and Sunday.
Submit snow reports through our website or social media.</instruction>
