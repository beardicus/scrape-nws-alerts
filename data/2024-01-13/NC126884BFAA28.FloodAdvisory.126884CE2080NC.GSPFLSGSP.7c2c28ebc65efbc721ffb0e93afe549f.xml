<headline>Flood Advisory issued January 13 at 12:22AM EST until January 13 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM EST THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of Cabarrus County in Piedmont North Carolina.
* WHEN...Until 900 AM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1216 AM EST, The river gauge along the Rocky River above
Irish Buffalo Creek showed water levels rising to near 12
feet early this morning in response to the period of heavy
rainfall yesterday. No additional rainfall is expected
overnight, but runoff from the earlier rainfall will likely
push the Rocky River above the action stage of 12 feet for
several hours. Minor flooding is thus expected or ongoing in
the Rocky River channel and nearby tributaries this morning.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Mt Pleasant and Midland.
- Flooding is most likely along the immediate Rocky River
channel. Flooding from Back Creek may approach Pharr Mill
Road due to backwater effects from the elevated Rocky River.
