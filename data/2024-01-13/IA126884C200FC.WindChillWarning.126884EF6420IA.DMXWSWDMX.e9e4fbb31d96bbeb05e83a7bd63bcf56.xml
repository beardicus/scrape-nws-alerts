<headline>Wind Chill Warning issued January 13 at 2:55PM CST until January 16 at 12:00PM CST by NWS DesMoines</headline>
<description>...Blizzard and Poor Travel Conditions Continue...
...Life Threatening Wind Chills into Early Next Week...
.An area of light snow continues to move across Iowa today. In
addition, northwest winds will continue to cause near-blizzard to
blizzard conditions across portions of central Iowa and to the
north and west. Any new snowfall will aide in creating poor to whiteout
conditions at times, especially in rural areas. Significant
drifting is remains likely. The northwest winds have ushered in
Arctic cold air with current temperatures already falling below
zero across the western half of the state. This Arctic air
combined with breezy to strong winds will create dangerous
temperatures and wind chills through early next week, with wind
chill values as low as 45 below zero possible at times.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT CST TONIGHT...
...WIND CHILL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST TUESDAY...
...BLIZZARD WARNING IS CANCELLED...
* WHAT...For the Winter Weather Advisory, snow. Additional snow
accumulations of up to one inch. Winds gusting as high as 40
mph. For the Wind Chill Warning, dangerously cold wind chills.
Wind chills as low as 45 below zero.
* WHERE...Central into Western Iowa.
* WHEN...For the Winter Weather Advisory, until midnight CST
tonight. For the Wind Chill Warning, until noon CST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Blowing snow will
significantly reduce visibility. The dangerously cold wind
chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10
minutes.</description>
