degrees below zero likely through early next week. A Wind Chill
Warning is in effect for western and southern Minnesota tonight
through Sunday morning. A Wind Chill Advisory is in effect for
eastern Minnesota and western Wisconsin tonight through Sunday
morning. Looking ahead, these will likely need to be reissued
again for Sunday night into Monday morning.
