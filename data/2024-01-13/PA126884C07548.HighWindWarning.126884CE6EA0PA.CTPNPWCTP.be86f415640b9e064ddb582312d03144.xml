<headline>High Wind Warning issued January 13 at 5:42AM EST until January 13 at 9:00PM EST by NWS State College</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM EST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...West-Southwest winds 20 to 30 mph with gusts of 55 to 60
mph expected, especially late this morning through early this
evening. The stronger wind gusts will gradually decrease later
tonight.
* WHERE...Cambria and Somerset Counties.
* WHEN...Through 9 PM EST this Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...Damaging winds could blow down trees and power
lines. Scattered power outages are expected. Travel will be
difficult, especially for high profile vehicles.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The West-Southwest wind gusts will likely
increase again Sunday morning, topping 45 mph for a brief period
as a secondary cold front brings true arctic air into the
region, possibly accompanied by a band of dangerous snow squalls
and requiring another Wind Advisory or High Wind Warning.</description>
<instruction>People should avoid being outside in forested areas and around
trees and branches. If possible, remain in the lower levels of
your home during the windstorm, and avoid windows. Use caution if
you must drive.

The latest forecast information can be found on the NWS State
College Facebook page and Twitter @NWSStateCollege, or on the web
