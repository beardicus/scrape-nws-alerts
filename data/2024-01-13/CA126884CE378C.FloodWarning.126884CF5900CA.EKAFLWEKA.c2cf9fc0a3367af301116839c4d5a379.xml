<headline>Flood Warning issued January 13 at 4:59PM PST until January 14 at 12:00AM PST by NWS Eureka</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM PST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Urban area and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall continues.
* WHERE...A portion of northwest California, including the following
county, Humboldt.
* WHEN...Until 800 PM PST.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying

will take several hours for all the water from these storms to
work through local drainage systems in urban areas.

indicated heavy rain. Flooding is already occurring in the
warned area. Between 2 and 3 inches of rain have fallen.
