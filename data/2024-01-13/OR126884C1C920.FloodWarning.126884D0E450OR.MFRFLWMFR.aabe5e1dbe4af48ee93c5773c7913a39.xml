* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is occurring.
* WHERE...A portion of southwest Oregon, including the following
counties, Curry and far western Josephine.
* WHEN...Until 100 AM PST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Streams will continue to rise into tonight due to
rainfall and excess runoff from earlier rainfall. Low-water
crossings are inundated with water and may not be passable. Expect
many areas of slow moving or standing water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1104 AM PST, trained weather spotters reported flooding in
the warned area.  Between 2 and 5.3 inches of rain have
fallen.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches are possible in
the warned area. The Chetco River at Brookings is expected to
rise rapidly this afternoon and evening. A forecast peak of
22.7 feet would be around the historical peaks of 22.2 feet
on 1/19/2012 and 22.98 feet on 11/20/2012.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.</instruction>
