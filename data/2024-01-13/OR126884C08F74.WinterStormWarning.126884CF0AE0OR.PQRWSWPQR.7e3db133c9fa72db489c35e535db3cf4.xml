<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 13 at 3:09AM PST until January 13 at 10:00PM PST by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Heavy snow and blowing snow, with areas of freezing rain.
Total snow accumulations of 3 to 8 inches, with lighter snow
accumulations being across the south Portland metro. Ice
accumulations of a tenth to a quarter of an inch this afternoon.
East to northeast winds will gust 35 to 55 mph, with strongest
winds over the West Hills and the east Portland metro area.
* WHERE...Greater Portland Metro Area.
* WHEN...From 7 AM this morning to 10 PM PST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing snow
will significantly reduce visibility, mainly in the eastern
Portland metro. Gusty winds could bring down tree branches and
some powerlines. The cold wind chills as low as 10 below zero
could result in hypothermia if precautions are not taken.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Blizzard conditions expected across the
east Portland metro during peak snowfall rates later this
afternoon and evening. Sleet may also mix with snow at times
which would lead to lower snowfall amounts, mainly across the
south Portland metro.</description>
