drive through salt water, be sure to rinse your vehicle with
fresh water. Move electronics, vehicles or other valuables to
higher ground. Monitor vessels to ensure mooring lines don`t get
too tight and watch out for overwash around boat ramps. Secure
canoes or other watercraft stowed on beaches.</instruction>
