40 likely through early next week. A Wind Chill Warning is in
effect for western and southern Minnesota tonight through Sunday
morning. A Wind Chill Advisory is in effect for eastern Minnesota
and western Wisconsin tonight through Sunday morning. Looking
ahead, these will likely need to be reissued again for Sunday
night into Monday morning.
