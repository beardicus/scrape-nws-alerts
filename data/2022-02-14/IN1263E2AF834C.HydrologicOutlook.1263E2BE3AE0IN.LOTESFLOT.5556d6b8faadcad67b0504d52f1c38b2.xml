<description>...Heavy Rainfall, Shifting River Ice Likely This Week...
Warmer temperatures through the middle of this week will be
followed by widespread, locally heavy rainfall. Significant river
rises and near flood conditions will be possible in some areas,
and conditions will also become favorable for break-up ice jams.
Areas with the highest chance of flooding include the following
rivers and their tributaries: Fox, DuPage, Des Plaines, Kankakee,
Iroquois, and Vermilion.
Remaining snow cover contains up to one inch of water equivalent,
with the highest snow water content over portions of the
Vermilion, Kankakee, and Iroquois river basins. Soil frost depths
range from 8 to 15 inches across the area, which could reduce the
amount of infiltration from rainfall and snow melt. Current
conditions are generally increasing the threat of flooding if
heavy rainfall was to occur.
Warming temperatures to near 50 degrees by Wednesday are likely
to melt most of the remaining snowpack. Wednesday night into
Thursday, widespread rainfall is expected across the area, with
accumulations of 1.0 to 1.5 inches possible. Based upon current
soil conditions and rainfall occurring at approximately the same
time as snow melt, significant river rises are likely, and
isolated flooding is possible. Flooding may include poor drainage
areas and low-lying areas along area rivers.
In addition to river rises and possible flooding due to heavy
rainfall, significant ice cover on area rivers could break up due
to warmer temperatures, snow melt, and rainfall. Break-up ice jams
will be possible, especially along the Fox, Iroquois, and
Kankakee Rivers. Ice jams can develop very quickly and lead to
rapid water level fluctuations with little or no notice.
Persons with interests along area rivers should monitor the
latest forecasts and statements from the National Weather Service.</description>
