<description>...Heavy Rainfall Likely Wednesday Night...
Current indications are that widespread significant rainfall is
likely Wednesday night. Rainfall totals of 1 to 1.5 inches
are expected, especially near and south of a Chicago to LaSalle
Peru line including northwest Indiana.
Latest analysis from the National Operational Hydrologic Remote
Sensing Center suggests that a half inch to locally an inch of
snow water equivalent remains locked in snow pack across portions
of the Kankakee, Illinois, Vermilion, and Iroquois River basins.
An unseasonably warm and moist air mass will likely result in
rapid melting of the remaining snow pack Tuesday night into
Wednesday.
The ground remains frozen across the CWA with frost depths of 8
inches to over a foot across the entire CWA. The frozen ground
will likely result in a high percentage of runoff from the melting
snow and expected heavy rainfall Wednesday night. If rainfall of
the expected magnitude falls, then some flooding of low lying and
poor drainage areas is likely Wednesday night into Thursday
morning.
In addition, the run off will flow into area rivers, many of which
are partially to largely ice covered. The unseasonably mild
temperatures followed by quickly rising stream flow will lead to
an increased the risk of localized break up ice jam flooding. Ice
jam flooding can develop very quickly and lead to sudden rises in
water levels.
Any one living near or with interests in low lying or flood prone
areas, including near typical ice jam locations on area rivers,
should closely monitor later forecasts and statements from the
National Weather Service.</description>
