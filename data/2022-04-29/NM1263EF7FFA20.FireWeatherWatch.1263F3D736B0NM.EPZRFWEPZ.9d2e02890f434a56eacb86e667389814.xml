<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued April 29 at 2:40PM MDT until May 01 at 9:00PM MDT by NWS El Paso</headline>
<description>...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS TODAY AND SUNDAY FOR LOW
HUMIDITY AND STRONG WINDS...
.Very dry air remains in place, and breezy winds will continue this
afternoon. Thus elevated to critical fire weather conditions are
expected across much of south-central New Mexico and far west
Texas today. Breezy winds and critically dry fuels will increase
the risk for rapid fire spread. Another upper level storm system
will approach the region on Sunday to give us another windy day
with critical fire weather conditions.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM MDT THIS EVENING
FOR STRONG WINDS AND LOW HUMIDITY FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONES 112 AND
113...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH
SUNDAY EVENING FOR STRONG WINDS AND LOW HUMIDITY FOR FIRE WEATHER
ZONES 112 AND 113...
The National Weather Service in El Paso Tx/Santa Teresa has

morning through Sunday evening.

and southwest New Mexico.

<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now, or will shortly. A combination of
strong winds, low relative humidity, and warm temperatures can
contribute to extreme fire behavior.
A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are forecast to occur. Listen for later forecasts and possible
Red Flag Warnings.</instruction>
