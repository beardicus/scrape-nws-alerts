<headline>High Wind Warning issued April 29 at 2:13AM CDT until April 30 at 4:00PM CDT by NWS Goodland</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT MDT /1 AM
CDT/ TONIGHT TO 3 PM MDT /4 PM CDT/ SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Northwest winds at 30 to 45 mph with gusts up to 65 mph
expected.
* WHERE...Mainly along and north of Interstate 70.
* WHEN...From midnight MDT /1 AM CDT/ tonight to 3 PM MDT /4 PM
CDT/ Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous travel conditions, especially on major
routes such as Interstate 70, Highway 385, Highway 83, and
Highway 283. Reductions in visibility associated with blowing
dust possible. Wind of this magnitude may also down trees,
power lines, and damage property.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The strongest winds are anticipated to
occur late tonight and Saturday morning, or between midnight and
noon MDT Saturday.</description>
<instruction>Expect difficult travel conditions along the Interstate 70
corridor in eastern Colorado and northwest Kansas tonight and
Saturday. Watch for objects blowing across the roadway and into
your path. Keep a safe distance from cars in adjacent lanes as
strong gusts could suddenly push a vehicle outside its lane of
travel. Take extra care in high-profile vehicles such as a truck,
van, or SUV, or when towing a trailer, as these are more prone to
be pushed or even flipped by high winds.
High dust concentrations can aggravate asthma and cause respiratory
problems, especially in children, the elderly, or those with pre-
existing respiratory conditions. The Kansas Department of Health
and Environment recommends taking preventative measures such as
staying indoors or wearing protective breathing masks, if outside.</instruction>
