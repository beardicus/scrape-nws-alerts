<headline>Red Flag Warning issued April 29 at 4:22AM MDT until April 29 at 7:00PM MDT by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>...Critical Fire Weather Conditions Expected This Afternoon...
.Strong northwest winds are forecast to develop Friday and spread
across the urban corridor and plains, with dry conditions during
the afternoon leading to critical fire weather conditions. The
highest danger will be over the southern plains where humidity
will be particularly low, but given the forecast wind speeds,
fire danger concerns still exist for areas north including the
Denver metro and portions of the plains to the north and east
despite more marginal humidity.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM THIS MORNING TO
7 PM MDT THIS EVENING FOR WIND AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR FIRE
WEATHER ZONE 247...
* Affected Area...Fire Weather Zone 247.
* Timing...11 AM to 7 PM MDT Friday.
* Winds...Northwest 25 to 35 mph with gusts up to 55 mph.
* Relative Humidity...As low as 11 percent.
* Impacts...Any fire that starts will have the potential to
spread rapidly, and would be difficult if not impossible to
control. Avoid any and all outdoor activities that may produce
a spark and start a fast moving and potentially destructive
wildfire.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now....or will shortly. A combination of
strong winds...low relative humidity...and warm temperatures can
contribute to extreme fire behavior.</instruction>
