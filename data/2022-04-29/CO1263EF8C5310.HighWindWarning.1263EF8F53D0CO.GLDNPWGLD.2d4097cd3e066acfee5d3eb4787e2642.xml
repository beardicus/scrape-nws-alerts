expected.

<instruction>Difficult travel conditions are expected tonight and Saturday.
Watch for objects blowing across the roadway and into your path.
Keep a safe distance from cars in adjacent lanes as strong gusts
could suddenly push a vehicle outside its lane of travel. Take
extra care in high-profile vehicles such as a truck, van, or SUV,
or when towing a trailer, as these are more prone to be pushed or
even flipped by high winds.</instruction>
