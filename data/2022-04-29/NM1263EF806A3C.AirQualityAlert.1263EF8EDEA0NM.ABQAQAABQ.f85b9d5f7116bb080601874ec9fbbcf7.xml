<headline>Air Quality Alert issued April 29 at 5:27PM MDT  by NWS Albuquerque</headline>
<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT...
The following message is transmitted at the request of the New Mexico
Departments of Health and Environment.
* WHAT...Smoke from several large wildfires burning over northern New
Mexico will be transported to the southeast through Friday evening
with increased potential for surface smoke to drift southward along
the Rio Grande Valley during the overnight into Saturday morning.
* WHERE...Smoke will continue to significantly impact areas across
much of Mora, San Miguel, and southern Colfax counties with impacts
extending east and southeast across the High Plains of eastern New
Mexico. Impacted communities include Mora, Sapello, Watrous, Wagon
Mound, Ocate, La Cueva, Conchas, and Cuervo. Smoke impacts are also
expected along parts of the Rio Grande Valley from near White Rock,
Santa Fe and Pueblo of Cochiti to Kewa Pueblo, the Pueblo of San
Felipe, and Algodones. Reduced visibilities may be encountered along
State Road 518 with impacts at times along the I-25 corridor
between Wagon Mound and Santa Fe.
* WHEN...Remainder of this afternoon through noon MDT Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Those with conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and heart
disease will be especially vulnerable to impacts from poor air
quality, as will adults over age 65, young children, and pregnant
women if smoke concentrations become unhealthy.
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method available
at https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/IndoorQuality.html and
https://cv.nmhealth.org
New Mexicans will also need to take steps to keep their homes cool to
avoid heat-related illnesses. NMDOH offers tips here:
