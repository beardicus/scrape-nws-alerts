<description>...GUSTY WINDS WITH DRIFTING SNOW AND ICY ROADS POSSIBLE...
Locally strong and gusty winds continue this morning along the
eastern slopes of the Sisseton Hills, with southwest winds of 25
to 40 mph with occasional higher gusts. The locations most
affected will be the higher terrain areas of the Sisseton Hills as
well as up to 15 miles east of the hills. This includes
Interstate 29 between Summit and Sisseton. U.S. Highway 12 from
Summit to Milbank may also experience strong winds. The winds are
expected to gradually diminish through the morning hours.
The strong winds will lead to primarily drifting snow, but when
combined with temperatures in the upper 20s, the snow has been
sticking to some roads and leading to icy spots. There may be
very localized areas where the snow is lofted and reducing
visibilities, primarily along I-29 near the Wilmot exit. Anyone
with travel plans across far northeast South Dakota should be
prepared for inclement weather and are urged to slow down and
allow for extra distance between vehicles if need be.</description>
