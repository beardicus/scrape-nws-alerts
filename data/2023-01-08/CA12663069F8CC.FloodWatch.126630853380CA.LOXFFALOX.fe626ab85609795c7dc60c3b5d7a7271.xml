<headline>Flood Watch issued January 08 at 1:55PM PST until January 09 at 4:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY EVENING THROUGH TUESDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible within
the entire Watch area. Areas of most concern include the recent
burn areas like the Fish and Lake burns, urban roads and freeways,
and in creeks and streams.
* WHERE...Los Angeles County, including the Bobcat, Lake, Fish, Dam,
Emigrant, North, Palisades, Tumbleweed, Ranch2, and Route burn
scars.
* WHEN...From Monday evening through Tuesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Extensive street flooding and flooding of creeks and rivers are
possible. Significant flash flooding is possible anywhere. Urban
areas should expect significant flooding of some roads and
freeways, with major delays or closures. Excessive runoff will
result in flooding of creeks and streams. While there is a chance
of main stem river flooding, water flowing through normally dry
rivers and washes will threaten homeless encampments.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A strong Pacific storm system will bring periods of
widespread heavy rainfall with rates up to around an inch per
hour. Rainfall totals of 2 to 5 inches will be common over
urban areas, with 5 to 9 inches expected in the mountains and
foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. Isolated amounts of
12 inches are possible.

Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop or if evacuations are ordered.</instruction>
