<headline>Flood Watch issued January 08 at 1:55PM PST until January 09 at 6:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY MORNING THROUGH TUESDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible within
the entire Watch area. Areas of most concern include the Alisal
burn scar, urban roads and freeways, and in creeks and streams.
* WHERE...Santa Barbara County, including the Alisal burn scar.
* WHEN...From Monday morning through Tuesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Significant flash flooding is possible anywhere. This
includes mud and debris flows in and below the Alisal burn scar.
Urban areas should expect significant flooding of some roads and
freeways, with major delays or closures. Excessive runoff will
result in flooding of creeks and streams. While there is a chance
of main stem river flooding, water flowing through normally dry
rivers and washes will threaten homeless encampments.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A strong Pacific storm system will bring periods of
widespread heavy rainfall with rates up to around an inch per
hour. Rainfall totals of 2 to 5 inches will be common over
urban areas, with 5 to 10 inches expected in the mountains
and foothills, especially over the Santa Ynez
range. Isolated amounts of 12 inches are possible.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop or if evacuations are ordered.</instruction>
