<description>...STRONG ATMOSPHERIC RIVER WILL BRING IMPACTS TO THE BASIN AND
RANGE THROUGH MID WEEK...
* A potent Atmospheric River storm is still expected to impact
west central Nevada Monday into Tuesday. This system will bring
copious amounts of moisture with periods of rain and snow. Light
snowfall is likely Monday morning, potentially impacting the
work commute. Snow levels are expected to rise during the day
Monday before dropping again Monday evening through Tuesday.
The greatest snowfall accumulations outside of the higher
terrain will be west of Highway 95 near Fernley, Silver Springs,
and Nixon where up to 2 inches are possible. Elevations above
5000 feet, including the upper sections of USA Parkway, may
receive 6 or more inches of total snowfall from early Monday
morning through Tuesday.
* While winds are not expected to cause major travel disruptions,
gusty and choppy conditions will be possible on Pyramid Lake
each day and boaters should exercise caution.</description>
