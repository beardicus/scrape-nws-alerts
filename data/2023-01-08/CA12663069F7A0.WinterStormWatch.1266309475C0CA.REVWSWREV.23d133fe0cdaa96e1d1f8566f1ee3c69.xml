<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 08 at 1:52PM PST until January 10 at 4:00PM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Heavy wet snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 1 to
3 inches possible, except 3 to 9 inches possible above 5000
feet. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Surprise Valley California.
* WHEN...From late tonight through Tuesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow levels will start around 4000 feet
early Monday. They will rise to 4500 to 5000 feet for a time on
Monday afternoon before falling back below 3500 feet Monday
night through Tuesday. Because of the uncertainty and variation
of snow levels along with precipitation intensity, urban and
small stream flooding is possible in the lower valleys,
especially where there is poor drainage from current debris and
snowpack. The severity of flooding remains highly dependent on
variation of the rain/snow line, so monitor conditions closely.</description>
<instruction>Now is the time to prepare an emergency kit for your home and
car. If traveling consider alternate plans, remember to carry
tire chains, extra food, water and clothing. Once the storm
arrives, travel may be difficult or impossible for an extended
period of time.
Clean out storm drains and debris. If your home is prone to
nuisance flooding, consider taking preventative actions like sand
bags.</instruction>
