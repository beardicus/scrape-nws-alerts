<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 08 at 1:52PM PST until January 10 at 4:00PM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH
TUESDAY AFTERNOON...
* CHANGES...Included stronger wind gust potential along US-95.
* WHAT...Heavy wet snow possible. The highest snow amounts will
favor west of US-95. Total snow accumulations of up to 2 inches
possible below 5000 feet. Above 6000 feet, 4 to 12 inches are
possible with amounts up to 24 inches above 7000 feet west of US-
95. Winds could gust as high as 50 mph with stronger gusts
possible for wind prone areas of US-95.
* WHERE...Mineral and Southern Lyon Counties.
* WHEN...From late tonight through Tuesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow levels will start around 4000-5000 feet
early Monday. They will rise to 5500-6500 feet for a time on
Monday afternoon before falling back to valley floors Monday night
through Tuesday. Because of the uncertainty and variation of snow
levels along with precipitation intensity, urban and small stream
flooding is possible in the lower valleys, especially where there
is poor drainage from current debris and snowpack. The severity of
flooding remains highly dependent on variation of the rain/snow
line so monitor conditions closely.</description>
<instruction>Now is the time to prepare an emergency kit for your home and
car. If traveling consider alternate plans, remember to carry
tire chains, extra food, water and clothing. Once the storm
arrives, travel may be difficult or impossible for an extended
period of time.
Clean out storm drains and debris. If your home is prone to
nuisance flooding, consider taking preventative actions like sand
bags.</instruction>
