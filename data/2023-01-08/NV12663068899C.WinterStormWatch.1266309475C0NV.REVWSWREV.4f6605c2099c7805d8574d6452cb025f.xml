<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 08 at 4:15AM PST until January 10 at 4:00PM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH
TUESDAY AFTERNOON...
* CHANGES...Updated snowfall amounts and wind gusts.
* WHAT...Heavy wet snow possible. Total snow accumulations of up
to 4 inches in the valleys, except 4 to 8 inches above 5000
feet. Above 6,000 feet, including cities like Virginia City,
isolated totals up to 2 feet are possible. Wind gusts up to 45
mph possible.
* WHERE...Greater Reno-Carson City-Minden Area.
* WHEN...From late tonight through Tuesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow levels will start at all valley floors
early Monday. They are expected to rise to 5,500-6,500 feet for
a time on Monday afternoon and evening before falling back to
4,000-5,000 feet through Tuesday. However, there remains a
chance that snow will be the primary precipitation type for a
longer part of the day on Monday. Because of this uncertainty
and variation of snow levels, urban and small stream flooding
will remain possible in the lower valleys, especially where
there is poor drainage from current debris and snowpack. The
severity of flooding will be highly dependent on the variation
of snow levels and precipitation rate during this time.</description>
<instruction>Now is the time to prepare an emergency kit for your home and
car. If traveling consider alternate plans, remember to carry
tire chains, extra food, water and clothing. Once the storm
arrives, travel may be difficult or impossible for an extended
period of time.</instruction>
