<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 08 at 4:15AM PST until January 10 at 4:00PM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH
TUESDAY AFTERNOON...
* CHANGES...Updated snowfall amounts.
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of up to 3
inches possible, except 3 to 12 inches above 5,000 feet. Wind
gusts 45 to 50 mph.
* WHERE...Northern Washoe County.
* WHEN...From late tonight through Tuesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS... Snow levels will start at 3,500-4,000 feet
early Monday. They will rise to 5,000-6,000 feet for a time on
Monday afternoon and evening before falling back to 4,000- 4,500
feet through Tuesday. Because of the uncertainty and variation
of snow levels and precipitation intensity, urban and small
stream flooding is possible in the lower valleys, especially
where there is poor drainage from current debris and snowpack.
The severity of flooding will be highly dependent on the
variation of snow levels and precipitation rate during this
time.</description>
<instruction>Now is the time to prepare an emergency kit for your home and
car. If traveling consider alternate plans, remember to carry
tire chains, extra food, water and clothing. Once the storm
arrives, travel may be difficult or impossible for an extended
period of time.</instruction>
