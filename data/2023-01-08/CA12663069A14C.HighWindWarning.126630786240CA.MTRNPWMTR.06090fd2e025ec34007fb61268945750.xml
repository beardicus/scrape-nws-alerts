<headline>High Wind Warning issued January 08 at 11:31AM PST until January 09 at 8:00AM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 8 PM THIS EVENING TO 8 AM PST
MONDAY...
* WHAT...South winds 20 to 35 mph with gusts up to 60 mph expected
in the valley locations. 35 to 50 mph with gusts up to 80 mph
above 1000 feet. Local gusts to around 80 mph along the coast
and highest peaks.
* WHERE...Marin Coastal Range, Sonoma Coastal Range, North Bay
Interior Mountains, Coastal North Bay, Including Point Reyes
National Seashore and North Bay Interior Valleys.
* WHEN...From 8 PM this evening to 8 AM PST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Damaging winds will blow down trees and power lines.
Widespread power outages are expected. Travel will be
difficult, especially for high profile vehicles.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Due to very saturated soils, even winds
on the lower end of the speed range can cause downed trees.
When trees fall, this can be a threat to lives, cause power
outages, and add debris to waterways which can exacerbate
flooding.</description>
<instruction>People should avoid being outside in forested areas and around
trees and branches. If possible, remain in the lower levels of
your home during the windstorm, and avoid windows. Use caution if
you must drive.</instruction>
