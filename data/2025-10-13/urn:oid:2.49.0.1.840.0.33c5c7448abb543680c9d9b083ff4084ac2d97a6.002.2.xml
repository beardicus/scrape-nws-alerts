        <headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued October 13 at 8:22PM EDT until October 14 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City NC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, up to 2 to 4 feet of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking
waves of 7 to 10 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards
Statement, dangerous rip currents, large breaking waves
expected, and strong longshore currents in the surf zone.

* WHERE...Hatteras Island.

* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, until 8 AM EDT
Wednesday. For the Beach Hazards Statement, from 8 AM EDT
Tuesday through Tuesday evening.

* IMPACTS...Up to 2 to 4 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in some areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in an elevated threat of property damage. Flooding
will extend inland from the waterfront threatening some homes
and businesses. Numerous road closures and flooding of vehicles
will be possible, including portions of NC 12. Dangerous
swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw a swimmer or
surfer head first into the bottom causing neck and back
injuries. Strong longshore currents will create dangerous
swimming conditions.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Tonight, water levels rises of 2 to 3 feet
will be possible around times of high tide. However, as we get
into Tuesday afternoon, a combination of strong northerly winds,
wave run up, and already battered and weakened dune and other
oceanside structures will bring the potential of more
significant impacts to Hatteras Island, mostly north of Cape
Hatteras, tomorrow afternoon and overnight (Tuesday 10/14) high
tides. Additionally, minor soundside flooding likely Tuesday
into Wednesday.

        <instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.

Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.

Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.

Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.

Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
