        <headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued October 13 at 4:48PM EDT until October 15 at 8:00AM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City NC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, 1 to 2 feet of inundation
above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways. For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip
currents. For the Coastal Flood Warning, 2 to 3 feet of
inundation above ground level expected in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways.

* WHERE...Ocracoke Island.

* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 11 AM EDT
Tuesday. For the Beach Hazards Statement, until 8 PM EDT this
evening. For the Coastal Flood Warning, from 11 AM Tuesday to
8 AM EDT Wednesday.

* IMPACTS...Up to 2 to 3 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in a low threat of property damage. Some roads and
low lying property including parking lots, parks, lawns, and
homes adjacent to the waterfront will experience shallow
flooding. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...For tonight, water levels rises of 1 to 2
feet will be possible around times of high tide. However, as we
get into Tuesday afternoon, a combination of strong northerly
winds and already battered and weakened dune and other oceanside
structures will bring the potential of more significant impacts
to Ocracoke Island, tomorrow afternoon and overnight (Tuesday
10/14) high tides where 2 to 3 feet of inundation will be possible.
Additionally, minor soundside flooding is expected to last
through at least Wednesday.

        <instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.

Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
