        <headline>Coastal Flood Watch issued October 13 at 4:25AM EDT until October 14 at 6:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City NC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, up to 2 to 4 feet of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways around high tide this afternoon. For the
High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 7 to 10 feet in the
surf zone. For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip
currents. For the Coastal Flood Watch, up to 2 to 4 feet of
inundation above ground level possible in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways around high tide Tuesday
afternoon.

* WHERE...Hatteras Island.

* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, until 5 PM EDT this
afternoon. For the High Surf Advisory, until 1 AM EDT Tuesday.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, through this evening. For the
Coastal Flood Watch, from Tuesday morning through Tuesday
afternoon.

* IMPACTS...Up to 2 to 4 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in some areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in an elevated threat of property damage. Flooding
will extend inland from the waterfront threatening some homes
and businesses. Numerous road closures and flooding of vehicles
will be possible, including portions of NC 12. Dangerous
swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The combination of strong onshore winds,
high astronomical tides, wave run up, and already battered and
weakened dune and other oceanside structures will bring the
potential of significant impacts to Hatteras Island, mostly
north of Cape Hatteras, with this afternoon's high tide, and
again tomorrow (Tuesday 10/14). Additionally, minor soundside
flooding is expected to begin later today and last through at
least Wednesday.

        <instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.

Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.

Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
