<description>...Minor Coastal Flooding And Ice Push Possible Tonight Into
Tuesday Night...
A strong storm now developing in the Western Bering Sea will move
into the Central Chukchi Sea this afternoon, to north of
Utqiagvik on Tuesday and then well north of Kaktovik on Wed.
This storm will bring West gales to most of the Western Arctic
Coast tonight through Tue night. This is expected to cause water
levels along the coast to rise 3 feet above normal tonight through
Tue night. This will likely cause water to flow on top of the sea
ice and river ice near the coast, and could cause minor flooding
of low lying areas near the coast.
Another concern is that sea ice is fractured and pushed offshore
in many area from the east winds of the past several days, and
that southwest winds tonight through Tuesday night could cause
ice to push onshore (called an Ivu) in many areas, especially in
areas that have developed open water leads near shore.
Flooding of infrastructure is not expected but people should move
valuables to higher ground. People should be alert for water
pushing on top of snow machine trails that run over ice or along
the coast. People should be alert for ice pushing onto beach areas
and the possibility that ice could push inland in some areas.</description>
