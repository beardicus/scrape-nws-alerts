<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 15 at 3:09PM AKST until January 15 at 9:00PM AKST by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...LONG DURATION SNOW EVENT CONTINUES IN THE THE NEW WORK WEEK...
.The three day system appears to be on its last legs with the
northerly frontal boundary beginning to pick up speeds as it moves
southward. Yakutat has had nearly all of its moisture and lift
move southward with Haines and Skagway to follow next. The bulk of
the moisture appears to be around the central panhandle and
Juneau, with rates around half an inch per hour and PW around 150%
of normal. Similar rates can be found around Haines and Skagway,
however, this is due to enhanced lift from a boundary between two
air masses.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM AKST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Heavy snow. Additional snow accumulations of 4 to 6
inches.
* WHERE...City and Borough of Juneau and Petersburg Borough.
* WHEN...Until 9 PM AKST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be very difficult and is discouraged
unless it is an emergency.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Heavy snow accumulations has led to
increased weight on rooftops and vessels in Juneau. Boats and
boat shelters may be at risk of collapse or capsizing. For
aircraft tied down outdoors, consider clearing wings and
empennages of excess snow to reduce stress on airframes.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water
with you in case of an emergency.
People are urged to prepare their property before the onset of
winter weather.
