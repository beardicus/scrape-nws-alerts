* IMPACTS...Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will
likely become slick and hazardous. The hazardous conditions
could impact the morning commute. Exposed skin may quickly
become frostbitten or frozen. Wind chill values may fall to
extremely dangerous levels and frostbite and hypothermia are
possible if precautions are not taken.</description>
<instruction>Delay all travel if possible. If travel is absolutely necessary,
drive with extreme caution and be prepared for sudden changes in
visibility. Leave plenty of room between you and the vehicle
ahead of you. Allow extra time to reach your destination. Avoid
sudden braking or acceleration and be especially cautious on hills
or when making turns.
You are urged to stay indoors until conditions improve. If you
must go outside, several layers of clothes will keep you warmer
than a single heavy coat. A hat is also important as half your
body heat loss can be from the head.</instruction>
