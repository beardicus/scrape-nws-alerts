<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 15 at 10:17AM AKST until January 15 at 10:00PM AKST by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...LONG DURATION SNOW EVENT CONTINUING INTO THE NEW WORK WEEK...
.As a system positions itself across the northern gulf, moisture
is being steered into the Panhandle, with widespread
precipitation enveloping the north and central areas. Warmer
temperatures have penetrated inland, with many observation sites
rising a few degrees by Monday afternoon. Expect snow ratios to
continue drop as snow becomes wetter and heavier. As the front
moves southeast Monday afternoon it will bring accumulating
snowfall to the southern Panhandle.
For the north, accumulating snowfall is expected to ramp up in the
morning hours due to a slow moving frontal boundary. Along this
front, as it moves south, expected the highest snowfall rates,
upwards of 0.75 - 1.0 inches per hour.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM AKST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Snow. Additional snow accumulations of 4 to 6 inches.
