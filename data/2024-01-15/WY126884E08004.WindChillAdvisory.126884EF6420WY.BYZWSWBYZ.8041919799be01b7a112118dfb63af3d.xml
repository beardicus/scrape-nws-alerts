<headline>Wind Chill Advisory issued January 15 at 1:41PM MST until January 16 at 11:00AM MST by NWS Billings</headline>
<description>...WIND CHILL ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 AM MST TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Very cold wind chills occurring. Wind chills from 20 to 40
below zero at times.
* WHERE...Portions of south central Montana and north central
Wyoming.
* WHEN...Until 11 AM MST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Exposed skin may become quickly frostbitten or frozen.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Westerly winds will increase tonight and may
cause local blowing and drifting snow into Tuesday. Areas most
likely to be affected include I-90 from Livingston to Big Timber,
and US-191 from Big Timber to Harlowton. Visibility may be reduced
to under 2 miles at times. Local rural roads in the area running
north to south may also see drifting. Drivers should use caution.</description>
<instruction>Persons are urged to stay indoors until conditions improve. If you
must go outside, dress in layers. Several layers of clothes will
keep you warmer than a single heavy coat. Cover exposed skin to
reduce your risk of frostbite or hypothermia. Keep pets indoors as
much as possible.
Drivers should be prepared to encounter locally reduced visibility
due to blowing snow.</instruction>
