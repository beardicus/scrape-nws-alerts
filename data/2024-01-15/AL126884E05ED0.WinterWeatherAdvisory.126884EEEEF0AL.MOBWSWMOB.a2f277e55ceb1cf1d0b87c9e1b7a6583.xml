drive with extreme caution and be prepared for sudden changes in

of you. Allow extra time to reach your destination. Avoid sudden
braking or acceleration and be especially cautious on hills or
when making turns.
You are urged to stay indoors until conditions improve. If you
must go outside, several layers of clothes will keep you warmer
than a single heavy coat. A hat is also important as half your
body heat loss can be from the head.</instruction>
