<description>...Minor Coastal Flooding And Ice Push Possible Today Into
This Evening...
A strong storm now in the Central Chukchi Sea will move to north
of Utqiagvik this afternoon and then well north of Kaktovik on
Wed. This storm will bring West gales to most of the Western
Arctic Coast as it moves east. This is expected to cause water
levels along the coast to rise 3 feet above normal through late
this evening. This will likely cause water to flow on top of the
sea ice and river ice near the coast, and could cause minor
flooding of low lying areas near the coast.
Another concern is that sea ice is fractured and pushed offshore
in many area from the east winds of the past several days, and
that southwest winds could cause ice to push onshore (called an
Ivu) in many areas, especially in areas that have developed open
water leads near shore.
Flooding of infrastructure is not expected but people should move
valuables to higher ground. People should be alert for water
pushing on top of snow machine trails that run over ice or along
the coast. People should be alert for ice pushing onto beach areas
and the possibility that ice could push inland in some areas.</description>
