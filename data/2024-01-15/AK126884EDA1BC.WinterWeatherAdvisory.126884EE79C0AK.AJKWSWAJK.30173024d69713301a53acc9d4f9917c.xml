<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 15 at 9:47PM AKST until January 16 at 3:00AM AKST by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...LONG DURATION SNOW EVENT CONTINUES IN THE THE NEW WORK WEEK...
.The three day system appears to be on its last legs with the
northerly frontal boundary beginning to pick up speeds as it
moves southward. Yakutat has had nearly all of its moisture and
lift move southward with Haines and Skagway to follow next. The
bulk of the moisture appears to be around the central panhandle
and Juneau, with rates around half an inch per hour and PW around
150% of normal. Similar rates can be found around Haines and
Skagway, however, this is due to enhanced lift from a boundary
between two air masses.
