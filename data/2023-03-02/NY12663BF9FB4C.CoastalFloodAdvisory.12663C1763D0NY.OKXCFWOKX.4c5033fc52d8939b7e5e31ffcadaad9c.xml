<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued March 02 at 3:27PM EST until March 04 at 8:00AM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM TO 8 AM EST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Up to 1 1/2 foot of inundation above ground level
expected in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...In New Jersey, Hudson, Eastern Essex and Eastern Union
Counties. In New York, Richmond (Staten Island), Kings
(Brooklyn) and Southern Queens Counties.
* WHEN...From 4 AM to 8 AM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding is expected in the most vulnerable
locations near the waterfront and shoreline. Expect up to 1 1/2
feet of inundation above ground level in low lying, vulnerable
areas. Some roads and low lying property including parking lots,
parks, lawns and homes/businesses with basements near the
waterfront will experience shallow flooding.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The magnitude of coastal flooding will be
heavily determined by the timing of winds backing from the east
to the northeast in relation to the time of high tide Saturday
morning. At this point, this windshift is expected to occur
before the time of high tide, but if this windshift is slower,
water levels could near moderate flood thresholds in a few
spots.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
