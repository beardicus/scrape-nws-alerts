<instruction>Intense thunderstorm lines can produce brief tornadoes and
widespread significant wind damage. Although a tornado is not
immediately likely, it is best to move to an interior room on the
lowest floor of a building. These storms may cause serious injury
and significant property damage.
To report severe weather contact your nearest law enforcement agency.
They will send your report to the National Weather Service office in
San Angelo.
Continuous cloud to ground lightning is occurring with these storms.
Move indoors immediately. Lightning is one of nature`s leading
killers. Remember, if you can hear thunder, you are close enough to
be struck by lightning.
Torrential rainfall is occurring with these storms, and may lead to
flash flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flooded roadways.</instruction>
