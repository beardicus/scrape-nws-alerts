<headline>Coastal Flood Watch issued March 02 at 3:27PM EST until March 04 at 11:00AM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT SATURDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...1 1/2 to 2 1/2 feet of inundation above ground level
possible in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...In Connecticut, Southern Fairfield and Southern New
Haven Counties. In New York, Southern Westchester, Bronx,
Northwest Suffolk, Northern Queens and Northern Nassau
Counties.
* WHEN...Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Widespread minor to scattered moderate flooding of
vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline. Expect 1 1/2
to 2 1/2 feet of inundation above ground level in low lying,
vulnerable areas. This will result in numerous road closures and
cause widespread flooding of low lying property including
parking lots, parks, lawns and homes/businesses with basements
near the waterfront. Vehicles parked in vulnerable areas near
the waterfront will likely become flooded. Flooding will also
extend inland from the waterfront along tidal rivers and bays.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...Breaking waves of 2 to 4 ft along open east
and northeast facing shorelines will result in beach erosion,
with wave splashover over dunes and bulkheads exacerbating
flooding of shoreline roads and properties. Localized minor
damage to shoreline structures is possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The magnitude of coastal flooding will be
heavily determined by the timing of winds backing from the east
to the northeast in relation to the time of high tide Saturday
morning. At this point, this windshift is expected to occur
right around the time of high tide. An earlier windshift would
result in water levels falling on the lower end of the forecast
range, while a later windshift resulting water levels falling
on the higher end of the forecast range.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
