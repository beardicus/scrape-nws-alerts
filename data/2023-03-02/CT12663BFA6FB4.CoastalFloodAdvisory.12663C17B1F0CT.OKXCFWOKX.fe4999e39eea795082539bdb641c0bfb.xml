<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued March 02 at 6:25PM EST until March 04 at 10:00AM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 5 AM TO 10 AM
EST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Up to 1 1/2 foot of inundation above ground level
expected in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...Southern Middlesex and Southern New London Counties.
* WHEN...From 5 AM to 10 AM EST Saturday.
* COASTAL IMPACTS...Minor flooding is expected in the most
vulnerable locations near the waterfront and shoreline. Expect
up to 1 1/2 feet of inundation above ground level in low lying,
vulnerable areas. Some roads and low lying property including
parking lots, parks, lawns and homes/businesses with basements
near the waterfront will experience shallow flooding.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...Breaking waves of 2 to 4 ft will result in
beach erosion, with wave splashover over dunes and bulkheads
exacerbating flooding of shoreline roads and properties.
Localized minor damage to shoreline structures is possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The magnitude of coastal flooding will be
heavily determined by the timing of winds shifting from the east
to the northeast in relation to the time of high tide Saturday
morning. At this point, this windshift is expected to occur
before the time of high tide, but if this windshift is slower,
water levels could near moderate flood thresholds in a few
spots.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
