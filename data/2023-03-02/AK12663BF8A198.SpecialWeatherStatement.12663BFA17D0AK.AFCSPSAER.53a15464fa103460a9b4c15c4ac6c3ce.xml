<description>...STRONG NORTHERLY WINDS FOR THOMPSON PASS TO VALDEZ THURSDAY
MORNING...
Northerly winds 25 to 40 mph with gusts to 55 mph have developed
early this morning and are expected to persist from Thompson Pass
to Valdez through around noon Thursday before slowly diminishing.
Expect areas of drifting and blowing snow in Valdez and along the
Richardson Highway. Although not as strong as this morning, winds
will remain gusty through Friday. A second round of very strong
winds, with gusts to 70 mph, is possible for Thompson Pass to
Valdez late Friday evening through Saturday.
High winds may move loose debris, damage property, and cause
power outages. Travel may be hazardous, especially for high
profile vehicles, and in areas of drifting and blowing snow.
