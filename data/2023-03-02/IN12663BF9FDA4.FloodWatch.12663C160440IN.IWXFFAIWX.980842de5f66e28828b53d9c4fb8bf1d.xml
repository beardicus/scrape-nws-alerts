<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY MORNING THROUGH FRIDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of northern Indiana and northwest Ohio, including
the following areas, in northern Indiana, Adams, Allen IN,
Blackford, Cass IN, Grant, Huntington, Jay, Miami, Wabash, Wells,

* WHEN...From Friday morning through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A period of moderate to heavy rainfall is expected from
Friday morning through early Friday evening. Storm total
rainfall amounts of 1.5 to 2.25 inches are expected. Wet soil
conditions from recent heavy rainfall will lead to a large
amount of runoff from this additional heavy rainfall.  This
will lead to flooding of low-lying and poor drainage areas,
including small creeks and streams.
