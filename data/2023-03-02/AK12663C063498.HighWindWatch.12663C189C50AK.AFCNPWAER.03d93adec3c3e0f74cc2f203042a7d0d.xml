<headline>High Wind Watch issued March 02 at 3:38PM AKST until March 04 at 12:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WATCH IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY EVENING THROUGH SATURDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Northeast winds 40 to 50 mph with gusts up to 75 mph
possible.
* WHERE...Valdez through Thompson Pass.
* WHEN...From Friday evening through late Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...High winds could move loose debris, damage property,
and cause power outages. Travel could be difficult, especially
for high profile vehicles.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...High winds in Thompson Pass and portions of
Valdez is possible as cold air moves in from the Copper River
Basin with a favorable jet stream pattern. High pressure
building over mainland Alaska will encourage the cold air to
develop, however the degree of cold air advection is not yet
entirely clear. Transportable snow may still be present at the
time of these higher winds, so areas of drifting or blowing snow
may impact visibilities.</description>
<instruction>A high wind watch means there is potential for a hazardous high
wind event. Monitor the latest forecasts and warnings for updates
on this situation. Fasten loose objects or shelter objects in a
safe location prior to the onset of winds.</instruction>
