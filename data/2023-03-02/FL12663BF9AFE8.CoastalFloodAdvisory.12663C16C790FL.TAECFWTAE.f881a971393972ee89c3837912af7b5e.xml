<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued March 02 at 1:34PM EST until March 04 at 4:00AM EST by NWS Tallahassee</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM FRIDAY TO 4 AM EST
SATURDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM FRIDAY TO 7 AM EST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding
expected. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 4
to 6 feet expected along St George Island. For the High Rip
Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Coastal Franklin County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 9 AM Friday to 4
AM EST Saturday. For the High Surf Advisory, from 4 PM Friday
to 7 AM EST Saturday. For the High Rip Current Risk, through
Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...Expect peak water levels of 1 to 2 feet above normally
dry ground along the coast around the time of high tide.
Impacts at these water levels often flood boat ramps around
Apalachicola and result in minor overwash along Alligator Point
Road. High tide at Apalachicola is at 334 pm ET on Friday and
again at 1232 am ET Saturday.
Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach
erosion are expected. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
