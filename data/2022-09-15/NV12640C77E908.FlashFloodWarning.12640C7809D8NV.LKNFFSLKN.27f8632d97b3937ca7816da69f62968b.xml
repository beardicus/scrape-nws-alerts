<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING FOR THE WILDCAT FIRE BURN SCAR REMAINS IN
EFFECT UNTIL 330 PM PDT THIS AFTERNOON FOR NORTH CENTRAL ELKO
COUNTY...
At 246 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing heavy
rain over the Wildcat Fire Burn Scar. Between 0.4 and 0.7 inches of
rain have fallen. The expected rainfall rate is 0.1 inches in 1
hour. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through the Wildcat Fire Burn Scar. The debris flow can
consist of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms in and around the
Wildcat Fire Burn Scar.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flooding of areas in and around the Wildcat Fire Burn
Scar.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
The Wildcat Fire Burn Scar of North Central Elko County
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
EXPECTED RAINFALL RATE...0.1 INCHES IN 1 HOUR</description>
<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.</instruction>
