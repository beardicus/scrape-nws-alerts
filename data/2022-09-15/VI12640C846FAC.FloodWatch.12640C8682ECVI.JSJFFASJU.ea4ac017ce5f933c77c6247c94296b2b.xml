<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY EVENING THROUGH
MONDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall associated
with the passage of Fiona
* WHERE...Portions of Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands.
* WHEN...From Friday evening through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone
locations, as well as mudslides and rockfalls in areas of
steep terrain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Fiona is now located 335 miles east-southeast of the Leeward
Islands and is expected to arrive Saturday. However, showers
and thunderstorms associated with Tropical Storm Fiona are
forecast to reach Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands as
early as Friday Night. These showers and thunderstorms will
continue to affect the local islands through at least Monday,
increasing the risk for flash flooding across most of the
forecast area. Soils are already saturated across areas of
higher terrain and, as a result, mudslides and rockfalls are
possible as well.
- Based on the most recent guidance, the most likely time period
for the heaviest rainfall activity is between Saturday and
Sunday, the areas most likely to receive the highest rainfall
accumulations are portions of southeastern Puerto Rico, where
there is a potential for rainfall totals to reach 6 to 8
inches with locally higher amounts around 10 inches. The U.S.
Virgin Islands, southern and eastern Puerto Rico has the
potential to observe rainfall totals between 4 and 6 inches.
Elsewhere, expect rainfall totals to range between 2 and 4
inches.
