<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued September 15 at 3:49PM AKDT until September 17 at 4:00PM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM FRIDAY TO
4 PM AKDT SATURDAY...
* LOCATION...The Kuskokwim Delta Coast, including Kuskokwim Bay.
Highest water levels will be from the Kuskokwim River mouth
and to the northwest.
* COASTAL FLOODING...Water levels are expected to rise 5 to 8
feet above the normal highest tide line.
* TIMING...From Friday evening through Saturday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Low lying areas could flood. Some critical
infrastructure may be inundated. Some shoreline erosion could
occur.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A powerful storm system, now the extra-
tropical remnants of Typhoon Merbok, will move from near the
Western Aleutians today, through the Southern Bering tonight and
Friday morning, and to the Bering Strait on Saturday. Winds are
expected to increase by late Friday morning and peak Saturday
morning before slowly diminishing through Saturday night. The
combination of strong winds and fetch will produce a storm
surge along the coast, leading to coastal flooding and the
potential for coastal erosion along the Kuskokwim Delta coast.</description>
<instruction>A coastal flood warning means that flooding is occurring or
imminent. Coastal residents in the warned area should be alert
for rising water, and take appropriate action to protect life and
property.</instruction>
