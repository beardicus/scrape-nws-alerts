<description>...HEAVY RAIN FOR LATE WEEK INTO THE WEEKEND FOR GULF COAST AND ICY
STRAIT CORRIDOR...
An atmospheric river has started moving across the northern half of
Southeast Alaska. Heavy rain started late Wednesday night near
Yakutat, and is expected to slide over the Icy Strait corridor and
central gulf coast on Friday. So far today, the Yakutat airport has
received about 1.9 inches of rain. The heavier rain is expected to
last through Saturday morning before starting to diminish Saturday
afternoon.
From early Thursday to Saturday around 5 to 8 inches of rainfall is
expected over the Northeast Gulf Coast including Yakutat. The
highest rain rates are expected on Thursday and again late Friday
and Saturday. The northern inner channels including the Icy Strait
corridor will see somewhat lesser amounts ranging from 2 to 5 inches
of rainfall with the highest amounts in the region from Cross Sound
to Juneau. The highest rain rates will be Friday Night into Saturday
though the area around Pelican and Glacier Bay could see heavier
rainfall on Thursday as well. There are some uncertainties in the
total rainfall forecast as terrain could cause some local areas to
get more or less rainfall.
Local rivers and streams are expected to rise as a result of this
rainfall. At this time, flood potential is low, but rivers may reach
or get near bankfull conditions. People who recreate along rivers
and streams across the northern panhandle should remain alert. For
