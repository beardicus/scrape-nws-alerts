<description>...HEAVY RAIN FOR LATE WEEK INTO THE WEEKEND FOR GULF COAST AND ICY
STRAIT CORRIDOR...
An atmospheric river has been giving moderate to heavy rain to parts
of the northern half of Southeast Alaska. Heavy rain started late
Wednesday night near Yakutat, and is expected to slide over the Icy
Strait corridor and central gulf coast on Friday. So far, the
Yakutat airport has received well over 2 inches of rain and the
Situk River has been rising rapidly from the heavy rain. This
heavier rain is expected to last through Saturday morning before
diminishing Saturday afternoon.
Through Saturday, around 5 to 8 inches of rainfall is expected over
the Northeast Gulf Coast, including Yakutat. While rain rates are
expected to decrease Friday, moderate to heavy rain will return
Friday night into Saturday. The northern inner channels, including
the Icy Strait corridor, will see somewhat lesser amounts ranging
from 2 to 5 inches of rainfall, with the highest amounts from Cross
Sound to Juneau. There are some uncertainties in the total rainfall
forecast as terrain could cause some local areas to get more or less
total rainfall.
Local rivers and streams are expected to rise as a result of this
rainfall. At this time, flood potential is low, but rivers may reach,
or get near, bankfull conditions. People who recreate along rivers
and streams across the northern panhandle should remain alert. For
