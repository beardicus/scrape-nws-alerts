<headline>Flood Advisory issued September 01 at 2:05PM MDT  by NWS Albuquerque</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM MDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Slow-moving thunderstorms are producing heavy rainfall over
far western portions of the Cerro Pelado wildfire burn scar.
Arroyo and small stream flooding caused by excessive runoff is
expected.
* WHERE...A portion of north central New Mexico, including the
following county, Sandoval, and in particular the western portion
of the Cerro Pelado wildfire burn scar.
* WHEN...Until 600 PM MDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 205 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms. This will cause arroyo and small stream
flooding. Between 0.5 and 1 inch of rain has fallen, and this
area is vulnerable to flooding and excessive runoff due to
the earlier Cerro Pelado wildfire.
- Additional rainfall amounts up to 0.5 inches are expected
over the area. This additional rain will result in minor
flooding.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include mainly
rural areas of East Central Sandoval County, including the
western portion of the Cerro Pelado wildfire burn scar.
Excessive runoff is expected into Vallecita Creek and other
nearby creeks and streams.</description>
<instruction>Runoff from rainfall will cause elevated water levels within
vulnerable drainages in and downstream of the Cerro Pelado wildfire
burn area.
Arroyos, streams, and normally dry rivers can become raging killer
currents in a matter of minutes. Water in arroyos can travel many
miles and take hours to reach your location from upstream rain areas.</instruction>
