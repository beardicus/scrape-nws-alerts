<headline>Flood Warning issued September 01 at 3:50AM CDT until September 02 at 5:12AM CDT by NWS Midland-Odessa</headline>
<description>...Forecast flooding changed from Minor to Moderate severity and
increased in duration for the following rivers in Texas...
Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch affecting Brewster County.
.Heavy rainfall in the Rio Grande basin has resulted in elevated
flows along the Rio Grande, including Johnson Ranch which is
forecast to crest in moderate flood through this morning. Additional
rainfall is expected through through afternoon.
For the Rio Grande...including Johnson Ranch...Moderate flooding is
forecast.
...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL LATE TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is occurring and moderate flooding is
forecast.
* WHERE...Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch.
* WHEN...Until late tonight.
* IMPACTS...At 12.0 feet (3.7 meters), the river reaches bankfull,
minor lowland flooding occurs, and no significant damage is
expected.
At 15.0 feet (4.6 meters), flood stage is reached.  Moderate
lowland flooding begins.  Roads that lead to Cottonwood Campground
and River Road may flood.  Stages are practically synonymous with
the gage at Cottonwood Campground at Castolon (CSTT2), and
therefore represent the reach from Santa Elena Canyon through
Cottonwood Campground, where damage may occur.  Cattle also graze
in the lowlands, and may be threatened.
At 19.0 feet (5.8 meters), the river reaches major flood stage.
Flooding begins to occur upstream in Cottonwood Campground at
Castolon, as stages at each location are practically synonymous.
Moderate lowland flooding begins at the gage site, but no damage
occurs.  The gage is inaccessible, as River Road is impassable at
several locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 3:15 AM CDT Thursday the stage was 16.5 feet (5.0 meters).
- Recent Activity...The maximum river stage in the 24 hours
ending at 3:15 AM CDT Thursday was 16.5 feet (5.0 meters).
- Forecast...The river will rise to 17.7 feet (5.4 meters) late
this morning. It will then fall below flood stage late this
afternoon to 12.6 feet (3.8 meters) late this evening. It
will rise to 13.4 feet (4.1 meters) tomorrow morning. It will
then fall again and remain below flood stage.
- Flood stage is 15.0 feet (4.6 meters).

17.1 feet (5.2 meters) on 07/26/2004.
