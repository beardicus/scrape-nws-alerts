<description>...HEAVY RAIN FOR LATE WEEK INTO THE WEEKEND...
An atmospheric river has started moving across the northern half of
Southeast Alaska. Heavy rain started late Wednesday night near
Yakutat, and is expected to slide over the northern inner channels
on Friday. So far the Yakutat airport has received 1.81 inches of
rain. The heavier rain is expected to last through Saturday morning
before starting to diminish Saturday afternoon.
From early Thursday to Saturday around 5 to 8 inches of rainfall is
expected over the Northeast Gulf Coast including Yakutat. The
highest rain rates are expected on Thursday and again late Friday
and Saturday. The northern inner channels will see somewhat lesser
amounts ranging from 2 to 5 inches of rainfall with the highest
amounts in the region from Cross Sound to Juneau. The highest rain
rates will be Friday Night into Saturday though the area around
Pelican and Glacier Bay could see heavier rainfall on Thursday as
well. There are some uncertainties in the total rainfall forecast as
terrain could cause some local areas to get more or less rainfall.
Local rivers and streams are expected to rise as a result of this
rainfall. At this time, flood potential is low, but rivers may reach
or get near bankfull conditions. People who recreate along rivers
and streams across the northern panhandle should remain alert. For
