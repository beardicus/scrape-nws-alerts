SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Idalia made landfall as a category 3 storm near the Big Bend region
of Florida earlier this morning. Idalia is forecast to continue
tracking to the northeast, passing just inland of the southeast
Georgia and southeast South Carolina coastline this evening through
early Thursday morning.
Bands of heavy rainfall will impact southeast Georgia and southeast
South Carolina today into tonight with 1 to 3 inches of rain forecast
along the coast and 4 to 8 inches forecast for inland locations.
Conditions will further deteriorate through this afternoon and into
tonight as tropical storm force winds develop across southeast Georgia
and spread up the coast and into portions of southeast South Carolina.
Hurricane conditions are forecast to develop as the center of Idalia
tracks over portions of southeast Georgia, the entire southeast
Georgia coast, and the lower southeast South Carolina coast this
evening. Tornadoes will be possible across the area today,
particularly along the coast, and waterspouts will be possible across
the adjacent Atlantic coastal waters. Finally, there is the potential
for storm surge this evening through early Thursday morning along the
southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina coasts, where
inundation up to 5 feet above ground level is anticipated.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across southeast Georgia and southeast South
Carolina. Potential impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding could prompt many rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries could rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple locations. Small streams, creeks, canals, ditches may
become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and barriers
could become stressed.
- Flood waters could enter many structures within multiple
communities; some structures become uninhabitable or are washed
away. Flood waters could cover multiple escape routes. Streets
and parking lots become rivers of moving water with underpasses
submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous. Many road and
bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
- Drinking water and sewer services could be negatively impacted.
- Hazardous containers and materials could possibly be present in
flood waters.
* SURGE:
Protect against life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across the southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina
coast. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Areas of inundation of saltwater along immediate shorelines and
in low-lying spots farther inland near rivers and creeks, with
storm surge flooding accentuated by waves. Damage to several
buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in normally vulnerable low
spots.
- Moderate to major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching
dunes. Strong and numerous rip currents.
- Minor to moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and
piers. Several small craft broken away from moorings,
especially in unprotected anchorages. Some navigation aids
possibly displaced well off station, creating difficult
navigation near inlets and waterways.
* WIND:
Protect against life-threatening wind having possible extensive
impacts across portions of southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina,
especially closer to the coast from around Reidsville to around Savannah,
and around Beaufort. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some window,
door, and garage door failures leading to structural damage.
Mobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed. Damage
accentuated by airborne projectiles. Some locations may be
uninhabitable for weeks.
- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne
projectiles outside.
- Large trees snapped or uprooted.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and access routes
impassable.
- Large areas with power and communications outages, which could
persist for days.
- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a dangerous tornado event having possible significant
impacts across southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina, especially
closer to the coast. Potential impacts include:
- Isolated to scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution of
emergency plans.
- Scattered locations could experience enhanced damage due to
tornadoes with a few spots of considerable damage, power loss,
and communications failures.
- Scattered locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses,
mobile homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees
snapped or uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed
about.
* OTHER COASTAL HAZARDS:
Prepare for additional coastal hazards along the entire southeast
Georgia and southeast South Carolina coastline including dangerous
rip currents, high surf, and beach erosion.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
If a Tornado Warning is issued for your area, be ready to shelter
quickly, preferably away from windows and in an interior room not prone
to flooding. If driving, scan the roadside for quick shelter options.
If in a place that is vulnerable to high wind, such as near large
trees, a manufactured home, upper floors of a high-rise building, or
on a boat, consider moving to a safer shelter before the onset of
strong winds or flooding.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
