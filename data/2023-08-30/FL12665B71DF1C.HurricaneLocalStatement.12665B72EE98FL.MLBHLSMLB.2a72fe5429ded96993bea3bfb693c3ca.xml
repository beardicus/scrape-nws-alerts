SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Idalia made landfall along the coast of the Florida Big
Bend near Keaton beach around 745 AM, with maximum sustained winds
near 125 mph and an estimated central pressure of 949 mb. As of
1100 AM, Idalia is now a Category 1 hurricane, located 15 miles south-
southeast of Valdosta, Georgia.
A Tropical Storm Warning remains in effect for Lake, Osceola, Orange,
Seminole, Volusia, and Brevard counties. For the Atlantic waters, a
Tropical Storm Warning remains in effect north of Sebastian Inlet.
In addition, a Tornado Watch remains in effect for Osceola and Brevard
counties northward until 3 PM this afternoon.
Showers and squalls associated with outer rain bands from Idalia
continue to move across the Florida peninsula. As Idalia continues to
the northeast, local conditions will gradually improve. However, gusty
winds in squalls are still possible into at least the first half of the
afternoon, and a brief tornado cannot be ruled out. Windy conditions
remain, even outside of squalls, and a Wind Advisory is in effect until
7 PM this evening.
Rain amounts of 1 to 3 inches have fallen across portions of east-
central Florida. An additional 1 to 2 inches of rain is possible
before rain chances gradually decrease tonight.
High seas, rough surf, life-threatening rip currents, and beach
erosion are expected through the remainder of the day, with improving
conditions into Thursday.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are ongoing across east-
central Florida. Remain well sheltered from hazardous wind having
limited impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Some damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Several large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* TORNADOES:
Potential impacts from tornadoes are ongoing across east-central
Florida. Remain well braced against a dangerous tornado event having
possible significant impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- The occurrence of scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- Some places may experience tornado damage with a few spots
of considerable damage, power loss, and communications failures.
- Locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses, mobile
homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees snapped or
uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed about.
Dangerous projectiles can add to the toll.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are ongoing across
east-central Florida. Remain well guarded against locally hazardous
flood waters having limited impacts. If realized, these impacts
include:
- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter currents.
Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may become swollen
and overflow in spots.
- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually
vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding of water
occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become
near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge
closures.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to stay inside and away from windows. Listen for
updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Keep a
battery-powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.
Keep your cell phone charged and in power-saving mode. If you lose
power, use it sparingly and mainly for personal emergencies and
check-ins.
Do not be a thrill seeker or risk your life for senseless photos or
videos.
Move to the safest place within your shelter if it begins to
fail, preferably an interior room on the lowest floor as long as
flooding is not a concern.
If a tornado warning is issued for your area, quickly move to the
safest place within your shelter. Protect your head and body.
