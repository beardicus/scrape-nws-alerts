SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Idalia is now located over southeast Georgia and has weakened to a
tropical storm this afternoon. Idalia is forecast to continue to track
northeast, passing over Savannah and Charleston this evening and
moving offshore early Thursday morning.
Bands of heavy rainfall will continue to impact southeast Georgia and
South Carolina this evening, with highest amounts to occur over inland
locations. The tornado threat will remain across all of South Carolina
this afternoon into early evening and slowly come to an end across
southeast Georgia. Finally, there is the potential for storm surge
this evening through early Thursday morning along the southeast Georgia
and southeast South Carolina coasts, where inundation up to 5 feet
above ground level is anticipated.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
southeast South Carolina and interior Georgia. Remain well guarded
against life- threatening flood waters having additional extensive
impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding could prompt many rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries could rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple locations. Small streams, creeks, canals, ditches may
become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and barriers
could become stressed.
- Flood waters could enter many structures within multiple
communities; some structures become uninhabitable or are washed
away. Flood waters could cover multiple escape routes. Streets
and parking lots become rivers of moving water with underpasses
submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous. Many road and
bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
- Drinking water and sewer services could be negatively impacted.
- Hazardous containers and materials could possibly be present in
flood waters.
* TORNADOES:
Potential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across portions of
southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia. Remain well braced
against a particularly dangerous tornado event having possible
extensive impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Numerous tornadoes can greatly hinder the execution of
emergency plans.
- Tornadoes could produce pockets of extensive destruction, power
loss, and communications failures. In some locations, tornado
winds and deadly projectiles demolish sturdy buildings, sweep
away structures upon weak foundations, obliterate mobile homes,
snap off and uproot large trees, lift vehicles off the ground
and throw with distance, and destroy small boats destroyed.
* SURGE:
Protect against life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across the southeast South Carolina coast and portions of the
southeast Georgia coast. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Areas of inundation of saltwater along immediate shorelines and
in low-lying spots farther inland near rivers and creeks, with
storm surge flooding accentuated by waves. Damage to several
buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in normally vulnerable low
spots.
- Moderate to major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching
dunes. Strong and numerous rip currents.
- Minor to moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and
piers. Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially
in unprotected anchorages. Some navigation aids possibly
displaced well off station, creating difficult navigation near
inlets and waterways.
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia. Remain well sheltered
from dangerous wind having possible significant impacts. If realized,
these impacts include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges and access routes
impassable.
- Travel by vehicle or on foot increasingly difficult. Danger of
death or injury from falling objects such as trees or electric
wires outside.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines, which could persist for hours
or days.
- Some poorly secured small craft could break loose from their
moorings.
* OTHER COASTAL HAZARDS:
Prepare for additional coastal hazards along the entire southeast
Georgia and southeast South Carolina coastline including dangerous rip
currents, high surf, and beach erosion.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Do not enter evacuated areas until officials have given the all clear
to return.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to stay inside and away from windows. Listen for
updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Keep a battery-
powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.
Keep your cell phone charged and in power-saving mode. If you lose
power, use it sparingly and mainly for personal emergencies and check-
ins.
If you are prone to flooding or in an area under a storm surge watch
or warning, be prepared for the possibility of a quick and dramatic
rise in water levels.
If a tornado warning is issued for your area, quickly move to the
safest place within your shelter. Protect your head and body.
