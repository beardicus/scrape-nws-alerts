<headline>Rip Current Statement issued August 30 at 3:36AM EDT until August 30 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM EDT THIS MORNING
THROUGH THIS EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO 6 PM
EDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents
expected. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of
6 to 8 feet expected in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Southwest Suffolk, Southeast Suffolk and Southern
Nassau Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, from 8 AM EDT this
morning through this evening. For the High Surf Advisory, from
2 PM this afternoon to 6 PM EDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Life-threatening rip currents are
likely for all people entering the surf zone. Anyone visiting
the beaches should stay out of the surf. Rip currents can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
