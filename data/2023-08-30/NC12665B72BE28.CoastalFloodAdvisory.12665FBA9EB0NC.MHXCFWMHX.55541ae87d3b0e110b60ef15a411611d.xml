<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM EDT FRIDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 8 PM THIS EVENING TO
8 AM EDT FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents
and large breaking waves in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood
Advisory, 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level expected
in low- lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.
For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 6 to 10
feet expected in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Ocracoke Island.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, until 8 PM EDT this
evening. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 11 PM EDT
Friday. For the High Surf Advisory, from 8 PM this evening to
8 AM EDT Friday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only isolated
road closures expected. Inundation of portions of Hwy 12 around
high tide is possible. Dangerous swimming and surfing
conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep
even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
Dangerous shore break can throw a swimmer or surfer head first
into the bottom causing neck and back injuries.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
