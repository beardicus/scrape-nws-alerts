<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 30 at 6:39PM AKDT  by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON AKDT SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...Tanana River from Delta Junction to Fairbanks
* WHEN...Until noon AKDT Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding is occurring in low lying areas along the
Tanana River from Delta Junction to Fairbanks and further
downriver. In Fairbanks, several inches of water is flowing over
the Melanie Lane and Chief John Drive and going overbank nearby at
Perkins Landing. Several driveways and yards are inundated with
water. Minor flooding is also occuring around the boat landing at
Whitestone Farms near Delta Junction. Minor flooding or bankfull
conditions are expected through Saturday.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 500 PM AKDT, heavy rain that fell over the south slopes of
the Alaska Range from Denali to the Alcan Border is causing
high water to flow down the Delta River and other rivers
draining the Alaska Range. This has caused the Tanana River
to rise to bankfull and overbank in some locations.
Additional heavy rain in the Alaska Range the next few days
and will result in more runoff into the Tanana River.
- For Tanana River at Big Delta:
At 5:00pm Wed the stage was 22.5 feet.
Flood Stage is 23.0 feet.
Forecast: The river is expected to remain steady at this
level into Friday.
For Tanana River at Fairbanks:
At 5:00pm Wed the stage was 25.3 feet.
Flood Stage is 24.5 feet.
Forecast: The river is expected to remain steady at this
level into Saturday.
