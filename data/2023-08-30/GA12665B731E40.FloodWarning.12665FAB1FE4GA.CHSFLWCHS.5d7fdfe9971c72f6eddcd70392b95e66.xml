<headline>Flood Warning issued August 30 at 7:52PM EDT until further notice by NWS Charleston</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 1045 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
...REPLACES FLASH FLOOD WARNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Portions of southeast Georgia, including the following
counties, Bulloch, Candler, Effingham, Jenkins and Screven.
Portions of southeast South Carolina, including the following
counties, Allendale, Hampton and Jasper.
* WHEN...Until 1045 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring. Streams
continue to rise due to excess runoff from earlier rainfall.
Expect many areas of slow moving or standing water. It will take
several hours for all the water from these storms to work through
local drainage systems in urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 751 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain slowly
diminishing across the area as the center of Tropical Storm
Idalia moves into southern South Carolina. Many dirt roads
have been washed out across the area and flooding is likely
ongoing in many places. While additional flash flooding is
unlikely, flooding will continue for several more hours.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 0.5 to 2 inches are possible
in the warned area.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Statesboro, Metter, Sylvania, Hampton, Lake Warren State
Park, Varnville, Estill, Fairfax, Brooklet, Portal, Brunson,
Gifford, Newington, Oliver, Furman, Scotia, Rocky Ford,
Luray, Hunters and Captolo.</description>
