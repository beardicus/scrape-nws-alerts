- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Coastal Volusia,
Inland Northern Brevard, Inland Southern Brevard, Inland
Volusia, Mainland Northern Brevard, Mainland Southern Brevard,
Northern Brevard Barrier Islands, Northern Lake, Orange,
Osceola, Seminole, Southern Brevard Barrier Islands, and
Southern Lake
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 140 miles west of Leesburg FL
- 29.1N 84.1W
- Storm Intensity 130 mph
- Movement North-northeast or 25 degrees at 18 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
The center of Major Hurricane Idalia is located around 60 miles
west of Cedar Key, Florida early this morning. Idalia currently has
maximum sustained winds of 130 mph and is moving north-northeast at
18 mph. The north-northeastward motion is expected to continue this
morning as Idalia is forecast to cross the Florida Gulf coast and near
Apalachee Bay this morning as a dangerous, major hurricane.
A Tropical Storm Warning remains in effect for Lake, Osceola, Orange,
Seminole, Volusia, and Brevard counties. For the Atlantic waters, a
Tropical Storm Warning remains in effect north of Sebastian Inlet.
In addition, a Tornado Watch is in effect for Lake, Volusia, Seminole,
Orange and Osceola counties until 6 AM this morning. An additional
Tornado Watch later this morning is likely as conditions remain
favorable for tornado development.
Showers and squalls associated with outer rain bands from Idalia have
pushed inland across the Florida peninsula this morning. As Idalia
accelerates towards the Florida Big Bend over the next few hours,
conditions locally will deteriorate further. The possibility of strong
wind gusts in squalls will increase as tropical storm force winds
extend well south and east of the storm`s center. Idalia is currently
making its closest pass to east-central Florida. Even as the storm
moves north of the area this afternoon, conditions will remain quite
windy. A Wind Advisory has been issued for portions of the area,
beginning at 10 AM.
Gusty squalls will be capable of torrential downpours today. Around
one-half to one inch of rain is forecast for coastal areas and
Okeechobee County this morning, and one to two inches is forecast west
of I-95 from Brevard and Osceola Counties northward, with locally
higher amounts possible. One to two inches of rain has already fallen
from Osceola County to Volusia County. Locations in closer proximity
to the center of Idalia, generally along and northwest of Interstate
Four in east-central Florida, may receive higher rainfall totals.
In addition to strong wind gusts, a threat for tornadoes will continue
through the day due to increasing wind shear associated with Hurricane
Idalia. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive warnings, including
NOAA Weather Radio and local media.
Incoming Atlantic swell from Major Hurricane Franklin, combined with
winds from Idalia, is leading to high seas, rough surf, an increase in
life-threatening rip currents, and beach erosion during high tides
through today.
Do not let your guard down as impacts from Major Hurricane Idalia will
continue to be felt far from the center of the storm, including across
east-central Florida.
Have multiple ways to receive tornado warnings in the event they are
issued for your area, and continue to monitor the latest updates from
the National Weather Service in Melbourne, Florida and National
Hurricane Center.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
east-central Florida. Remain well sheltered from hazardous wind having
possible limited impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Some damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* TORNADOES:
Potential impacts from tornadoes are ongoing across east-central
Florida. Remain well braced against a dangerous tornado event having
possible significant impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- The occurrence of scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- Several places may experience tornado damage with a few spots
of considerable damage, power loss, and communications failures.
- Locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses, mobile homes
demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees snapped or uprooted,
vehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed about. Dangerous
projectiles can add to the toll.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are ongoing across east-
central Florida. Remain well guarded against locally hazardous flood
waters having possible limited impacts. If realized, these impacts
include:
- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter currents.
Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may become swollen
and overflow in spots.
- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually
vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding of water
occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become
near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge
closures.
* SURGE:
Direct surge impacts from Idalia are not expected. However, larger
swells and surf combined with Hurricane Franklin will bring a threat
for minor coastal flooding and beach erosion. Locations more vulnerable
to coastal flooding and beach erosion, such as portions of the Volusia
and Brevard county coast, should stay updated on the latest
information.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended actions.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to stay inside and away from windows. Listen for
updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Keep a battery-
powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.
Keep your cell phone charged and in power-saving mode. If you lose
power, use it sparingly and mainly for personal emergencies and
check-ins.
Do not be a thrill seeker or risk your life for senseless photos or
videos.
Quickly move to the safest place within your shelter if it begins to
fail, preferably an interior room on the lowest floor as long as
flooding is not a concern.
If a tornado warning is issued for your area, quickly move to the
safest place within your shelter. Protect your head and body.
