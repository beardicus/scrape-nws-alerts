SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Idalia will move off the South Carolina coast
tonight and farther offshore Thursday. The main impact will be heavy
rain and localized flooding through tonight, but tropical storm force
wind gusts are also expected, which could lead to some downed trees
and power lines. Isolated tornadoes are also possible tonight,
mainly near the NC coast.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
southeast North Carolina and northeast South Carolina. Remain well
guarded against life-threatening flood waters having possible
extensive impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Major flooding from rainfall may prompt evacuations and
numerous rescues.
- Rivers and streams may rapidly overflow their banks in multiple
places. Creeks and ditches will flood and may contain strong
currents.
- Flood waters may enter many structures, and some may become
uninhabitable. Some road scours or complete road failures will
be possible, along with the potential for sinkholes. Many
streets and parking lots may flood, and may be impacted by
flowing water. Many road and low-lying bridge closures are
possible with some weakened or washed away. Driving conditions
will be dangerous.
- The delivery of drinking water and sewer services may be
interrupted. Flood waters may be polluted and contain hazardous
materials.
* TORNADOES:
Potential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across mainly
coastal southeast NC. Remain well braced against a particularly
dangerous tornado event having possible extensive impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- The occurrence of numerous tornadoes can greatly affect
preparedness actions during tropical events.
- Tornadoes can significantly damage homes, destroy mobile homes,
uproot and snap trees, destroy cars and boats. Large and deadly
projectiles can add to the damage.
- Many places may experience tornado damage with a few spots of
immense destruction, power loss, and communications failures.
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
coastal northeast South Carolina and southeast North Carolina. Remain
well sheltered from dangerous wind having possible significant impacts.
If realized, these impacts include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding, along with damage to porches
and awnings. A few buildings experiencing window, door, and
garage door failures. Damage to vulnerable structures such as
carports, sheds and mobile homes is possible.
- Large limbs will be down with several trees snapped or
uprooted. Several fences and roadway signs may become blown
over. Some roads may become impassable due to large debris
blocking the roadway, especially within urban or heavily wooded
locations. Some bridges, causeways, and elevated roads may be
impacted by high winds making driving on them hazardous.
- Scattered power and communications outages are possible, but
more prevalent in areas with above ground lines.
- Small craft that are not properly moored may break loose.
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across
coastal northeast South Carolina and southeast North Carolina. Remain
well away from locally hazardous surge having possible limited impacts.
If realized, these impacts include:
- Localized inundation and minor over-wash is possible, mainly
along immediate shorelines and other vulnerable low-lying areas
along the coast. Low spots along waterways and tidal creeks may
also be impacted.
- Some portions of near-shore roads and parking lots may become
covered by surge water. Driving conditions may become hazardous
in places where the surge covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion is possible, mainly in the vulnerable
locations along the ocean front.
- Minor damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers is
possible. A few small craft may break away from moorings if not
properly secured.
- Navigation may be difficult near inlets and waterways, as
navigational aids may be off station or missing.
Elsewhere across southeast North Carolina and northeast South
Carolina, little to no impact is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to remain safely sheltered from the storm. Stay
inside and away from windows. Listen for updates and be ready in case
you lose electrical power. Locate your battery powered radio and
flashlight from your Emergency Supplies Kit. Keep these items close.
Continue to keep your cell phone well charged for as long as
possible. If you lose power, use it more sparingly and mainly for
personal emergencies and check-ins. Do not overload communications
systems with idle chatter.
