SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Idalia, now centered near Charleston late this
evening, is expected to continue moving northeast and offshore of the
Carolina coastline by Thursday morning.
Surge and tidal levels along the coast of southeast South Carolina
have dropped over the past couple of hours, with the tide gauge in
Charleston Harbor now below flood stage. The Storm Surge Warning north
of the Savannah River will continue for a few more hours, as some
areas continue to see flooding related to surge from this afternoon.
Tropical storm wind gusts will continue along the coastline of
southeast South Carolina, and in parts of Colleton, Dorchester, and
Berkeley Counties through the overnight. Winds will diminish from
southwest to northeast overnight as Idalia moves away from the area.
Heavy rain has ended over the area, though some bands of light to
moderate rain will linger in Colleton, Dorchester, Berkeley, and
Charleston Counties for the next several hours.
Dangerous rip currents and high surf will continue along the South
Carolina and Georgia coast through Thursday.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Protect against life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across the southeast South Carolina coast. Potential impacts
in this area include:
- Areas of inundation of saltwater along immediate shorelines and
in low-lying spots farther inland near rivers and creeks, with
storm surge flooding accentuated by waves. Damage to several
buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in normally vulnerable low
spots.
- Moderate to major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching
dunes. Strong and numerous rip currents.
- Minor to moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and
piers. Several small craft broken away from moorings,
especially in unprotected anchorages. Some navigation aids
possibly displaced well off station, creating difficult
navigation near inlets and waterways.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across parts of
southeast South Carolina. If realized, these impacts include:
- Rivers and tributaries could rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple locations. Small streams, creeks, canals, ditches may
become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and barriers
could become stressed.
- Flood waters could enter many structures within multiple
communities; some structures become uninhabitable or are washed
away. Flood waters could cover multiple escape routes. Streets
and parking lots become rivers of moving water with underpasses
submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous. Many road and
bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
- Drinking water and sewer services could be negatively impacted.
- Hazardous containers and materials could possibly be present in
flood waters.
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event continue to linger across parts
of Southeast South Carolina and coastal Georgia. If realized, these impacts
include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges and access routes
impassable.
- Travel by vehicle or on foot increasingly difficult. Danger of
death or injury from falling objects such as trees or electric
wires outside.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines, which could persist for hours
or days.
- Some poorly secured small craft could break loose from their
moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
RECOVERY PHASE - Do not enter evacuated areas until officials have
given the all clear to return.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Listen for updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Keep
a battery-powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.
Keep your cell phone charged and in power-saving mode. If you lose
power, use it sparingly and mainly for personal emergencies and
check-ins.
If you are prone to flooding or in an area under a storm surge watch
or warning, be prepared for the possibility of a quick and dramatic
rise in water levels.
