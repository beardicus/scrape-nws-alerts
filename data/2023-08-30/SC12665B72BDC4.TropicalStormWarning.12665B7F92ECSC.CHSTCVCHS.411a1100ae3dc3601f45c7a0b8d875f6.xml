in multiple locations. Small streams, creeks, canals,
ditches may become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems
and barriers could become stressed.
- Flood waters could enter many structures within multiple
communities; some structures become uninhabitable or are
washed away. Flood waters could cover multiple escape
routes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving
water with underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become
dangerous. Many road and bridge closures with some weakened

tornado winds and deadly projectiles demolish sturdy
buildings, sweep away structures upon weak foundations,
obliterate mobile homes, snap off and uproot large trees,
lift vehicles off the ground and throw with distance, and
destroy small boats destroyed.
