<headline>High Surf Advisory issued August 30 at 3:38AM EDT until September 02 at 2:00AM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM EDT THIS MORNING
THROUGH THIS EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 2 AM THURSDAY TO 2 AM EDT
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents
and large breaking waves expected in the surf zone. For the High
Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 8 to 11 feet expected in
the surf zone.
* WHERE...The beaches north of Cape Hatteras.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, from 8 AM EDT this
morning through this evening. For the High Surf Advisory, from
2 AM Thursday to 2 AM EDT Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore
break can throw a swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom
causing neck and back injuries. Ocean overwash likely Thursday
into Friday, and may continue into the weekend due to the strong
NE winds and back swell behind Idalia. This will likely impact
portions of NC-12, especially during times of high tide.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Localized ocean overwash will still be
possible for Hatteras Island with this mornings high tide
(around 7 AM).</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
