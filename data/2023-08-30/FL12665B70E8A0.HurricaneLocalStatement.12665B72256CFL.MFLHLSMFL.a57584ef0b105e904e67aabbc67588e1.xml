SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Idalia is moving northward across the eastern Gulf of
Mexico this morning and is approaching the Big Bend region of Florida
where it is expected to make landfall. It is then expected to move
northeastward across northern Florida and towards the Georgia and
Carolinas coast by late Wednesday into early Thursday.
The following are the primary hazards of concern with Idalia:
* Coastal Flooding/Surge - Higher than usual tides due to the
combination of surge from Idalia and the upcoming full moon could lead
to coastal flooding of 1 to 3 feet along coastal Collier and mainland
Monroe Counties. Other vulnerable coastal areas of southern Florida
could also experience minor coastal flooding, especially around the
times of high tide.
* Rainfall - The majority of the rainfall associated with the system
is forecast to fall through Wednesday. Additional rain amounts of 1 to
3 inches with localized higher amounts are possible. The highest
amounts are anticipated along the Gulf coast.
* Wind - Gusty southerly winds continue across South Florida. All of
South Florida could see winds gusts up to 40mph, with the highest
gusts likely during the day on Wednesday.
* Tornadoes - A low-end tornado threat is possible through Wednesday,
mainly across the lake Okeechobee region.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time
across South Florida.
* SURGE:
Little to no additional surge impacts expected.
Elsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact is anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Additional impacts from flooding rain are still a concern across
South Florida. Remain well guarded against locally hazardous flood
waters having further impacts of limited potential.
* TORNADOES:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time
across South Florida.
