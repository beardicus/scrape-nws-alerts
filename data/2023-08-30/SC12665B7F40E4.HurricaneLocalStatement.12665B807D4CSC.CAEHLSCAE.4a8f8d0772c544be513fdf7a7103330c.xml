SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Idalia will move northeast along eastern South

eastern Midlands and Pee Dee. Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches are
expected in those areas. Tropical Storm force wind gusts 40 to 50 mph
are also possible, but winds should slowly diminish after Midnight.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
the eastern Midlands. Remain well guarded against life-threatening
flood waters having possible extensive impacts.
If realized, these impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, arroyos, and
ditches may become dangerous rivers. In mountain areas,
destructive runoff may run quickly down valleys while
increasing susceptibility to rockslides and mudslides. Flood
control systems and barriers may become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.
Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with
underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.
Many road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
the eastern Midlands. Remain well guarded against dangerous
flood waters having additional significant impacts.
Elsewhere across the Midlands of central South Carolina and east
central Georgia CSRA, little to no impact is anticipated.
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
the eastern Midlands. Remain well sheltered from dangerous
wind having possible significant impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
Potential impacts from the main wind event are also now unfolding
across the eastern Midlands. Remain well sheltered from
hazardous wind having possible limited impacts.
Elsewhere across the Midlands of central South Carolina and east
central Georgia CSRA, little to no impact is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to stay inside and away from windows. Listen for
updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Keep a
battery-powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.
If you are prone to flooding, be prepared for the possibility of a
quick and dramatic rise in water levels.
