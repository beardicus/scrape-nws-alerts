SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Idalia will move northeast along eastern South
Carolina through tonight. The main impact expected from Idalia is the
enhanced potential for flash flooding tonight as heavy rain spreads in
from the coast. Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches are expected across
the central and eastern Midlands of South Carolina and the Central
Savannah River area of Georgia. Locally heavier amounts are possible.
Isolated Tornadoes are also possible across the eastern Midlands
through this evening. Tropical Storm force wind gusts 40 to 50 mph are
possible through tonight.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding along and
south of I-20. Remain well guarded against life-threatening flood
waters having possible extensive impacts. If realized, these impacts
include:
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, arroyos, and
ditches may become dangerous rivers. In mountain areas,
destructive runoff may run quickly down valleys while
increasing susceptibility to rockslides and mudslides. Flood
control systems and barriers may become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.
Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with
underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.
Many road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
north of I-20. Remain well guarded against dangerous
flood waters having possible significant impacts.
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding in the
far southeastern Midlands. Remain well sheltered from dangerous wind
having possible significant impacts. If realized, these impacts
include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
Potential impacts from the main wind event are also now unfolding
along and south of I-20. Remain well sheltered from
hazardous wind having limited impacts.
* TORNADOES:
Potential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across in the far
southeastern Midlands. Remain well braced against a dangerous tornado
event having possible significant impacts. If realized, these impacts
include:
- The occurrence of scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- Several places may experience tornado damage with a few spots
of considerable damage, power loss, and communications failures.
- Locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses, mobile
homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees snapped or
uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed about.
Dangerous projectiles can add to the toll.
Potential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding south of I-20.
Remain well braced against a tornado event having limited impacts.
Elsewhere across the Midlands of central South Carolina and east
central Georgia CSRA, little to no impact is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to stay inside and away from windows. Listen for
updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Keep a
battery-powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.
If you are prone to flooding, be prepared for the possibility of a
quick and dramatic rise in water levels.
If a tornado warning is issued for your area, quickly move to the
safest place within your shelter. Protect your head and body.
