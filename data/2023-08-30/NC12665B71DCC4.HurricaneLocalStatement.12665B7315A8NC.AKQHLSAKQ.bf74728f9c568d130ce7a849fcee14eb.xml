NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Eastern Currituck and
Western Currituck
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 580 miles southwest of Duck NC

SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Idalia has made landfall in the Big Bend region of
Florida this morning, and has weakened to a Category 1 hurricane.
Idalia will track northeast towards the Georgia and South Carolina
coast later today. Idalia will make it closest approach Thursday
afternoon as a tropical storm and as it tracks east, south of Cape
Lookout.
Tropical storm force wind gusts are expected to develop by Thursday
morning for coastal and inland Currituck County as well as the
Currituck Sound. A Tropical Storm Warning remains in effect for these
areas. Additionally, the pressure gradient between Idalia`s
circulation and high pressure to the north will result in strong winds
along the coast, even outside of the Tropical Storm Warning area.
Strong winds could lead to downed trees and scattered power outages.
Strong onshore winds could also lead to areas of minor to locally
moderate coastal flooding.
Heavy rain is expected this afternoon as a cold front moves into the
area. The cold front will stall over the area as heavy rain bands move
from Idalia tonight and will continue through Thursday evening. There
will likely be a sharp rainfall gradient across the local area as high
pressure over the Great Lakes builds south and east on Thursday. 2 to
4 inches of rainfall is forecast near and south of the Virginia North
Carolina border. Locally higher amounts are possible, especially along
and south of the Virginia North Carolina border where a Flood Watch
has been issued.
Dangerous marine conditions are expected to develop by early Thursday
with strong winds lasting into early Friday. Seas build to 7 to
12 feet on Thursday and remain elevated into Saturday.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across coastal northeast North Carolina, extending northward
to coastal Virginia and the southern Chesapeake Bay. Potential
impacts in this area include:
- Widespread storm surge flooding of vulnerable areas will result
in an elevated threat of property damage to homes and
businesses near the waterfront and shoreline.
- Sections of low-lying vulnerable roads, parking lots and
property will likely become flooded. Driving conditions could
become dangerous in places where flooding covers the road.
- Moderate to severe beach erosion is likely, including heavy
surf possibly breaching dunes, especially in vulnerable
locations. Strong and dangerous rip currents are likely.
- Minor to moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and
piers is likely. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
Elsewhere across CENTRAL AND EASTERN VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST NORTH
CAROLINA...AND THE LOWER MARYLAND EASTERN SHORE, little to no impact
is anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible
significant impacts across northeast North Carolina. Potential
impacts include:
- Flooding from heavy rainfall may prompt evacuations and rescues
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen, with swift
currents, and overspill their banks. Small streams, creeks, and
ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures and/or weaken
foundations. Some areas may experience areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures are expected.
Protect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across far southeast Virginia.
Elsewhere across CENTRAL AND EASTERN VIRGINIA AND THE LOWER MARYLAND
EASTERN SHORE, little to no impact is anticipated.
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
coastal and inland Currituck County NC. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, especially if soils are saturated. Some roadway signs
will sustain damage.
- A few roads will be impassable from debris. Hazardous driving
conditions on bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across CENTRAL AND EASTERN VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST NORTH
CAROLINA...AND THE LOWER MARYLAND EASTERN SHORE, little to no impact
is anticipated.
* TORNADOES:
Little to no are anticipated at this time
across CENTRAL AND EASTERN VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST NORTH CAROLINA...AND
THE LOWER MARYLAND EASTERN SHORE.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
Keep cell phones well charged. Cell phone chargers for automobiles
can be helpful, but be aware of your risk for deadly carbon monoxide
poisoning if your car is left idling in a garage or other poorly
ventilated area.
Rapidly rising flood waters are deadly. If you are in a flood-prone
area, consider moving to higher ground. Never drive through a flooded
roadway. Remember, turn around don`t drown!
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
