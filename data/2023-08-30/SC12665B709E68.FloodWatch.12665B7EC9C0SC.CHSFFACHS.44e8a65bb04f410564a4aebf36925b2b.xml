* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Tropical Cyclone Idalia is forecast to track along the
southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina coastline
after making landfall in the Big Bend region of Florida early
this morning. Rainfall is forecast to begin overspreading the
area from north to south through the day and into tonight.
Rainfall totals are forecast to be 4 to 8 inches inland, and
2 to 4 inches closer to the coast. Some of the heavier
rainfall is expected to occur this evening, coinciding with
the high tide, which will exacerbate the flash flooding
threat.
