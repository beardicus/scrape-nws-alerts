<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued November 22 at 2:22PM PST until November 24 at 8:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FOR WESTERN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND
EASTERN VENTURA COUNTY MOUNTAINS AND VALLEYS FROM 1 AM THURSDAY
THROUGH 11 AM FRIDAY...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FOR THE MALIBU COASTAL STRIP
WESTWARD TO THE VENTURA COUNTY COASTAL PLAIN FROM 8 AM THROUGH 8
PM THURSDAY...
. High confidence in a moderate to strong Santa Ana wind event
expected late Wednesday night through Friday morning. This Santa
Ana event will be a bit more out of the east than recent events
leading to more of a focus on the western San Fernando Valley and
western portions of the Santa Monica mountains. This orientation
typically provides more widespread gusty winds into coastal areas
of Ventura County as well. Wind gusts are expected to peak in the
40 to 55 mph range except up to 65 mph for favored mountain and
valley areas. These winds combined with critically low relative
humidity values ranging between 5 and 15 percent provide about a
70 percent chance of critical fire weather conditions starting
early Thursday morning, peaking in extent and intensity late
morning into the afternoon, and possibly continuing through Friday
morning for wind prone areas. There is a smaller window of
critical conditions for coastal areas along and west of Malibu
into Coastal Ventura County centered on the daytime Thursday.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY MORNING THROUGH
THURSDAY EVENING FOR GUSTY NORTHEAST WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE
HUMIDITY FOR THE MALIBU COASTAL STRIP WESTWARD INTO THE VENTURA
COUNTY COASTAL PLAIN...
* Winds...Northeast winds 20 to 30 mph with gusts of 45 to 55 mph
possible. Strongest Thursday morning.
* Relative Humidity...Humidity levels mostly in the 5 to 15
percent range.
* Impacts...If fire ignition occurs there could be rapid spread
of wildfire that would lead to a threat to life and property.</description>
<instruction>A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are likely to occur in the coming days. Residents near wildland
interfaces should prepare now on what to do if a wildfire breaks
out. See readyforwildfire.org and wildfirerisk.org for
