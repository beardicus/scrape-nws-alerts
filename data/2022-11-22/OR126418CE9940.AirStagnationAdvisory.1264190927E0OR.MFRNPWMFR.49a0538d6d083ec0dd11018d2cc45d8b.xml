<headline>Air Stagnation Advisory issued November 22 at 2:24PM PST until November 25 at 10:00PM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...AIR STAGNATION ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Stagnant air is expected, which may lead to
deteriorating air quality.
* WHERE...The valleys of Central Douglas County, Eastern Curry
County and Josephine County, and Jackson County.
* WHEN...Until 10 PM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Air stagnation is likely to result in diminishing
air quality with time, especially in and near areas with
significant sources of air pollution. Diminished air quality
is likely to cause health issues for people with respiratory
problems if precautions are not taken.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...In the wake of a front that will move
through today, mixing heights will only exceed the 1000 ft.
threshold for stagnating air by a few hundred feet and
transport winds will remain weak. Only slight improvement will
occur as a result. With stagnant conditions expected to return
Wednesday, and with coordination from DEQ, the advisory
remains in effect through Friday evening.

<instruction>People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with diminished air quality. N95 masks are
effective at filtering out the majority of harmful air
particulates.
State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor
burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be
limited as much as possible. According to state air quality
agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants
close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with
your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
