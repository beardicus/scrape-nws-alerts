<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM CDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has issued an Air Quality
Alert for fine particles pollution. The Air Quality Index (AQI)
is expected to reach the Red or Unhealthy category.
* WHERE...Northern Minnesota.
* WHEN...Until 10 AM CDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Some members of the general public may experience
health effects. Sensitive groups, such as people with lung
disease (including asthma), heart disease, and children and
older adults, may experience health effects.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Heavy ground-level smoke from wildfires in
the Northwest Territories of Canada is moving quickly across
southern Manitoba and towards the Minnesota border. The smoke is
expected to reach northwest Minnesota around noon Tuesday. The
smoke should reach as far south as Bemidji and as far east as
Ely. The heaviest smoke will be across the northwest corner of
the state. Winds across the region will become southerly by
Wednesday morning and the smoke will quickly retreat and clear
the state by 10 AM. Another wave of smoke is expected to move
into northern Minnesota late Wednesday evening.

<instruction>Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including
asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults, should
avoid prolonged or heavy exertion. The general public should limit
prolonged or heavy exertion. Reduce or eliminate activities that
contribute to air pollution, such as outdoor burning, and use of
residential wood burning devices. Reduce vehicle trips and vehicle
idling as much as possible. Keep windows closed overnight to
prevent smoke from getting indoors.</instruction>
