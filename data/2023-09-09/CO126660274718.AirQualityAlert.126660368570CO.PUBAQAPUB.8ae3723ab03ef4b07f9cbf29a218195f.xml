<description>...AIR QUALITY HEALTH ADVISORY FOR WILDFIRE SMOKE FROM 900 AM
SATURDAY UNTIL 900 AM SUNDAY...
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has
issued the following...
WHAT...Air Quality Health Advisory for Wildfire Smoke.
WHERE...Eastern Archuleta and southern Mineral and Hinsdale
Counties.
WHEN...900 AM Saturday September 09 to 900 AM Sunday September 10
IMPACTS...The Bear Creek and Quartz Ridge wildfires are producing
moderate to heavy smoke Saturday morning for eastern parts of
Archuleta and southern portions of Mineral and Hinsdale Counties.
This smoke will decrease by late Saturday morning as atmospheric
mixing increases. By Saturday night, moderate to heavy smoke from
the Bear Creek fire will accumulate along Weminuche Creek in
southern Hinsdale County to the west of Williams Creek campground.
Additionally, the Quartz Ridge wildfire in eastern Archuleta
County could produce moderate to heavy smoke Saturday night
through Sunday morning for locations along East Fork Road westward
to Highway 160 north of Pagosa Springs.
HEALTH INFORMATION...Public Health Recommendations: If smoke is
thick or becomes thick in your neighborhood you may want to remain
indoors. This is especially true for those with heart disease,
respiratory illnesses, the very young, and the elderly. Consider
limiting outdoor activity when moderate to heavy smoke is present.
Consider relocating temporarily if smoke is present indoors and is
making you ill. If visibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in
your neighborhood, smoke has reached levels that are unhealthy.</description>
