levels on the Kenai River from the Snow Glacier-dammed lake
outburst occurring near Snow River. Steady river rises will
cause minor flooding along Kenai River.

through this weekend before decreasing late Monday morning.
High water levels are expected further downstream in the
lower Kenai River, but flooding is not expected.
- -
Some locations that will experience flooding include...
- For Kenai River below Skilak Lake:
At 10:30am the stage was 12.36 feet.
Flood Stage is 13.0 feet.

At 8:00am the stage was 10.41 feet.
Flood Stage is 11.0 feet.
Forecast: A crest around 11.1 feet is expected around 10:00pm
