- A low pressure system just west of the Appalachians will keep
deep moisture in place across the area today. Multiple rounds
of slow moving showers and thunderstorms this afternoon
through this evening will lead to the potential for 2 to 4
inches of rainfall. This will result in the potential for
flash flooding across the North Carolina foothills and
Piedmont, mainly in urban areas and locations that have
received heavy rainfall in the past few days prior to today.
