<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT...
The following message is transmitted at the request of the New
Mexico Departments of Health and Environment, United States Forest
Service and the Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality Response
Program.
* WHAT...Transport winds have tended more westerly this afternoon as
compared to Monday with speeds generally in the 10-20 mph range. As
a result, smoke from the states largest wildfires will be pushed
toward the east until around sunset. Thereafter, surface winds will
gradually decouple and residual smoke will settle and drift down-
drainage resulting in the most significant impacts for locations
closer to the fires perimeters. There is still some uncertainty
regarding how far north thicker smoke from the Black and Bear Trap
fires will extend along the Middle Rio Grande Valley during the
evening and overnight hours. As smoke gradually settles this
evening, despite weakening westerly transport winds, surface smoke
may gradually funnel northward along and near the west slopes of the
Capitan, Gallinas and Manzano Mountains and resultant impacts
expanding along the Rio Grande Valley corridor. Increased smoke
impacts can be expected for valley locations south and southeast of
the Black fire in the Gila National Forest. In addition to smoke,
daytime temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above normal are expected for
many of the impacted communities. New Mexicans may also need to take
steps to avoid heat-related illnesses.
* WHERE...Locations most likely to experience the greatest impacts
from smoke include the following counties: Catron, Colfax, Mora,
San Miguel, Sierra, and Socorro counties. Impacted communities
include but are not limited to: Arrey, Chacon, Elephant Butte,
Gallinas, Guadalupita, Hatch, Las Vegas, Magdalena, Mora, Ocate,
Pecos, Sapello, San Antonio, Truth or Consequences, and Winston.
* WHEN...Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1pm MDT
Wednesday, May 18th.
* IMPACTS...Those with conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and heart
disease will be especially vulnerable to impacts from poor air
quality, as will adults over age 65, young children, and pregnant
women if smoke concentrations become unhealthy.
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method available
at https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/IndoorQuality.html and
https://cv.nmhealth.org
New Mexicans will also need to take steps to keep their homes cool to
avoid heat-related illnesses. NMDOH offers tips here:
