<description>...High Water Expected Along the Yukon River...
The National Weather Service has observed on satellite imagery an
ice jam on the Yukon River located approximately 7 miles upriver
from Grayling. The Yukon River is flowing overbank upriver from
the ice jam and flooding low lying areas east of the river. Residents
in Grayling, Anvik, Holy Cross, and Russian Mission will see a
rapid rise in water levels when the ice jam releases. At this
time, flooding is not expected in these communities but water
levels may rise to bankfull in some locations along with bank to
bank runs of ice moving downriver. Residents area encouraged to
monitor water levels as the breakup front moves through this
reach of the Yukon River and move items to higher ground.</description>
