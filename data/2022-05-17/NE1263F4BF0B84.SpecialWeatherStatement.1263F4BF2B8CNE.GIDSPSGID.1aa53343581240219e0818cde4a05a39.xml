<headline>Special Weather Statement issued May 17 at 5:33PM CDT  by NWS Hastings</headline>
<description>...Strong thunderstorms will impact portions of Furnas and west
central Harlan Counties through 615 PM CDT...
At 531 PM CDT, Doppler radar was tracking strong thunderstorms
capable of producing occasional landspout tornadoes along a line
extending from near Beaver City to 6 miles south of Wilsonville.
Movement was east at 20 mph. This storm has a history of producing
brief landspout tornadoes, but none are confirmed on the ground at
this time.
HAZARD...Landspouts, wind gusts up to 50 mph, and penny size hail.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Minor damage to outdoor objects is possible. Gusty winds
could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured
objects.
Locations possibly impacted include...
Beaver City, Wilsonville, Hendley and Hollinger.
LANDSPOUT...OBSERVED
MAX HAIL SIZE...0.75 IN
MAX WIND GUST...50 MPH</description>
<instruction>Although typically weaker and shorter lived than tornadoes associated
with organized supercell thunderstorms, landspout tornadoes can still
cause injury or minor damage. Landspouts develop as a surface front
or wind shift line interact with a towering cumulus cloud or
developing thunderstorms. Landspouts are not usually associated with
a wall cloud and are often difficult to detect with weather radar.
If a landspout is sighted, first take any necessary tornado safety
precautions, and then report the landspout activity to the National
Weather Service in Hastings and local law enforcement.
These storms may intensify, so be certain to monitor local radio
stations and available television stations for additional information
and possible warnings from the National Weather Service.</instruction>
