<description>...A strong thunderstorm will impact portions of southwestern Furnas
County through 515 PM CDT...
At 449 PM CDT, Doppler radar was tracking a line of strong
thunderstorms near and southwest of Wilsonville, or 18 miles
northwest of Norton, moving northeast at 15 mph. A landspout tornado
was recently reported in northwestern Norton County, and it is
possible that another landspout could form in southwestern Furnas
County. Please note this is only a possibility!
HAZARD...Landspouts and winds in excess of 40 mph.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Minor damage to outdoor objects is possible. Gusty winds
could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured
objects.
This strong thunderstorm will be near...
Wilsonville around 505 PM CDT.
Other locations in the path of this storm include Hendley.
LANDSPOUT...POSSIBLE
MAX HAIL SIZE...0.00 IN
MAX WIND GUST...40 MPH</description>
<instruction>Although typically weaker and shorter lived than tornadoes associated
with organized supercell thunderstorms, landspout tornadoes can still
cause injury or minor damage. Landspouts develop as a surface front
or wind shift line interact with a towering cumulus cloud or
developing thunderstorms. Landspouts are not usually associated with
a wall cloud and are often difficult to detect with weather radar.
If a landspout is sighted, first take any necessary tornado safety
precautions, and then report the landspout activity to the National
Weather Service in Hastings and local law enforcement.</instruction>
