<description>...FLOOD WARNING FOR SNOWMELT IN GLENNALLEN NORTH OF THE GLENN
HIGHWAY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM AKDT THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by snowmelt continues.
* WHERE...Glennallen north of the Glenn Highway
* WHEN...Until 400 PM AKDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of Moose Creek and surrounding areas in
Glennallen is occurring.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 941 AM AKDT, Rapid snowmelt is causing flooding. Flooding
will likely worsen in the afternoon and evening due to higher
temperatures. Water has receded a bit due to recent cool and
cloudy weather. Temperatures will warm significantly mid to
late week, which will result in more rapid snow melt, which
in turn could worsen the flooding.
- Glennallen north of the Glenn Highway is the most likely
place to experience flooding.
