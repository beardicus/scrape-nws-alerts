<headline>Coastal Flood Watch issued December 15 at 2:28PM EST until December 17 at 1:00PM EST by NWS Tallahassee</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY EVENING
THROUGH SUNDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Minor to locally moderate coastal flooding possible.
* WHERE...Coastal Dixie Counties.
* WHEN...From Saturday evening through Sunday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...A brief period of onshore flow around the time of high
tide early Sunday morning could lead to minor to low end
moderate coastal flooding. This could result in flooding of
roadways near the coast and water could potentially surround structures
immediately along the coastline.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The Coastal Flood Watch may be discontinued
later tonight should future forecasts show the storm system
moving further south and east of Dixie County further decreasing
the coastal flood threat.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
