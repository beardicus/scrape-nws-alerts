<headline>Dense Fog Advisory issued December 15 at 12:53AM PST until December 15 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...DENSE FOG ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST THIS MORNING...
...AIR STAGNATION ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Dense Fog Advisory, visibility one quarter of a
mile or less in dense fog. For the Air Stagnation Advisory,
stagnant air is expected, which may lead to deteriorating air
quality.
* WHERE...For the Dense Fog Advisory, valleys of eastern Curry and
Josephine County including the cities of Grants Pass, Merlin,
Selma, Wilderville and Illinois Valley. For the Air Stagnation
Advisory, Valleys of southern Oregon.
* WHEN...For the Dense Fog Advisory, until 10 AM PST Friday. For
the Air Stagnation Advisory, until 10 AM PST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous driving conditions due to low visibility.
Air stagnation is likely to result in diminishing air quality
with time, especially in and near areas with significant
sources of air pollution. Diminished air quality is likely to
cause health issues for people with respiratory problems if
precautions are not taken.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Localized freezing fog is possible, mainly
in the Merlin area and portions of the the Illinois Valley.
This may result in slippery roads, especially on bridges, this
morning.

<instruction>If driving, slow down, use your headlights, and leave plenty of
distance ahead of you.
People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with diminished air quality. N95 masks are
effective at filtering out the majority of harmful air
particulates.
State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor
burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be
limited as much as possible. According to state air quality
agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants
close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with
your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
