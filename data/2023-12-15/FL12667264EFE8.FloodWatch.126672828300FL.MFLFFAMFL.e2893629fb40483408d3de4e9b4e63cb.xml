<headline>Flood Watch issued December 15 at 1:18PM EST until December 17 at 7:00AM EST by NWS Miami</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT EST TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of southeast Florida, including the following
areas, Coastal Broward County, Coastal Miami Dade County, Coastal
Palm Beach County, Far South Miami-Dade County, Inland Miami-Dade
County, Metro Broward County, Metro Palm Beach County and
Metropolitan Miami Dade.
* WHEN...From midnight EST tonight through Sunday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Showers and thunderstorms are expected to develop late
tonight through early Sunday morning as low pressure develops
over the Gulf of Mexico and moves northeast across North or
Central Florida. Total rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches are
possible over the eastern areas of South Florida through
early Sunday morning with higher amounts where any showers
and thunderstorms train over the same area. This amount of
rainfall will lead to some flooding issues over the east
metro and coastal areas of South Florida due to the grounds
being already saturated from previous rainfall this week.
Therefore, a Flood Watch has been issued for the metro and
coastal areas of South Florida from late tonight through
early Sunday morning.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
