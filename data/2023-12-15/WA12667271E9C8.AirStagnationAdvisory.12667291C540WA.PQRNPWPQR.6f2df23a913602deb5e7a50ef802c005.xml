<description>...AIR STAGNATION ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM PST
MONDAY...
* WHAT...A period of stagnant air with light winds is expected.
* WHERE...In Oregon, Lower Columbia. In Washington, I-5 Corridor
in Cowlitz County.
* WHEN...Until 4 AM PST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Air stagnation could result in the development and

<instruction>People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with high levels of air pollution during
periods of stagnant air.
State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor
burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be
limited as much as possible. According to state air quality
agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants
close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with
your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
