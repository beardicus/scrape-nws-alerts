<description>...SPECIAL HYDROLOGIC OUTLOOK...
This outlook is for the Rio Grande Basin in south-central Colorado,
primarily for area rivers and creeks in Mineral, Rio Grande, Alamosa
and Conejos Counties.
This outlook is valid from May 5 to May 12, 2023.
The potential for minor flooding and inundation of low-lying
areas, due to accelerated snowmelt potential, is higher than
normal in the Rio Grande Basin.
...OUTLOOK FOR THE NEXT 7 DAYS...
The snowmelt season is well underway and snowpack in the eastern
San Juan Mountains remains well above normal for this time of year.
Warming temperatures and dry, windy conditions over the month of
April and into early May have accelerated snowmelt rates and have
produced higher than normal flows for area rivers and creeks this
early in the snowmelt season. After an anticipated slowdown of
snowmelt runoff over the weekend, another warming trend beginning
next week will accelerate snowmelt and further cause river and creek
levels to rise through the remainder of the week. This could result
in bankfull flows or possible minor flooding and inundation of
low-lying areas.
Any snowmelt flooding that develops will most likely be minor and
would only result in minimal property damage and minor public threat
or inconvenience.
