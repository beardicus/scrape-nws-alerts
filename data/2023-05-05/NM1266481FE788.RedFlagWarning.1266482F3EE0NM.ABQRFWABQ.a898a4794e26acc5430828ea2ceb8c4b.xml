<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM NOON TO 8 PM MDT SATURDAY FOR
MOST OF NORTHERN AND CENTRAL NEW MEXICO DUE TO STRONG WINDS, LOW
HUMIDITY, AND AN UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT SUNDAY FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHERN
AND EASTERN NEW MEXICO DUE TO STRONG WINDS, LOW HUMIDITY, AND AN
UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
.Winds are subsiding this evening, but additional rounds of
strong southwest winds, low humidity, seasonably warm
temperatures, and an unstable airmass will lead to critical fire
weather conditions below snowpack through the weekend. Widespread
critical fire weather is expected Saturday over all but
northwestern New Mexico. Critical conditions will then focus toward
the eastern half of the region Sunday. Critical conditions may
persist into the middle of next week. In addition, lightning
strikes from earlier this week may lead to new ignitions in
receptive fuels.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON TO 8 PM MDT
SATURDAY...
* AREA AND TIMING...North Central Mountains (120) below snowpack
from noon to 8 pm MDT Saturday.
* 20 FOOT WINDS...Southwest 20 to 25 mph with gusts to 35 mph.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...10 to 20 percent.
* IMPACTS...Any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly.
Outdoor burning is not recommended.</description>
