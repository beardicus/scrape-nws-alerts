<headline>Rip Current Statement issued May 05 at 3:55AM AST until May 05 at 6:00PM AST by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Life-threatening rip currents due to breaking waves up
to 6 feet.
* WHERE...Northern Coastlines of Puerto Rico including San Juan
and Vicinity, Northeast, North Central, and Northwest, as well
as for Culebra and the eastern tip of St. Croix.
* WHEN...Through this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Rip currents that can sweep even the best swimmers
away from shore into deeper water where it becomes difficult
to return to safety.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.</instruction>
