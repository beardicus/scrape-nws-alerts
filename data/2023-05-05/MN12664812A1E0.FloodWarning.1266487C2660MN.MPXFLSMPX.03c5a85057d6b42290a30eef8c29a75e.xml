<headline>Flood Warning issued May 05 at 9:48AM CDT until May 12 at 1:00AM CDT by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in
Minnesota...
Minnesota River at Granite Falls HWY 212 affecting Yellow
Medicine, Chippewa and Renville Counties.
Minnesota River at Morton affecting Redwood and Renville Counties.
Minnesota River at Savage affecting Scott, Carver, Dakota and
Hennepin Counties.
Minnesota River at Montevideo affecting Yellow Medicine, Chippewa
and Lac qui Parle Counties.
...The Flood Warning is cancelled for the following rivers in
Minnesota and Wisconsin...
Mississippi River near Hastings L/D 2 (COE) affecting Dakota,
Pierce, Goodhue and Washington Counties.
.Several chances of precipitation are expected through the weekend.
A half inch to an inch of rainfall area-wide seems like a good bet.
Localized areas could see 2 inches to perhaps even 3 inches, if any
training thunderstorms occur. However, these higher amounts should
be sparse and area river levels should still generally decrease.

* WHERE...Minnesota River at Morton.
* WHEN...Until early Friday morning.
