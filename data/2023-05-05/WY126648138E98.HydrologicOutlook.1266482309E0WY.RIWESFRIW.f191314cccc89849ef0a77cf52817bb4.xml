<description>...High River Flows and Flooding due to Snowmelt...
Despite cooler temperatures yesterday and today, rivers and streams
are expected to continue running high as warm temperatures have
melted much of the valley and foothills snowpack, which is making
its way into the main stem rivers.
Local emergency management reported widespread low-land flooding
near the Bear River and Salt River, with smaller tributary streams
running high as well. Currently, flooding is mainly affecting
low-lying agricultural areas. Streams are generally expected to
level off today, but remain high into early next week.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding. In hilly terrain, there are hundreds of low
water crossings which can be affected by increased stream flows. Do
not attempt to cross flooded roads. Please report observed flooding
to local emergency services or law enforcement.</description>
