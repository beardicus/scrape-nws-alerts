<description>...Slippery Roads Expected Across the Area for the Morning Commute...
Accumulating snowfall will continue across central and north-
central Wisconsin this morning, and spread eastwards across the
Fox Valley between 5 to 7am. Snowfall will create slippery roads
and hazardous travel conditions for the morning commute across the
area. Total snowfall amounts across the area between 1 to 3
inches of snow are expected, tapering off at most locations during
the late morning or early afternoon.
For central and north-central Wisconsin, light snowfall
accumulations have already fallen. Slick spots are likely through
the remainder of the morning, especially on raised surfaces such
as bridges, which may have icy spots under the snow.
For the Fox Valley, higher snowfall rates will arrive during the
morning commute, which will deteriorate road conditions and
lower visibility. Be prepared for changing conditions!
Be sure to use caution on your commute in the morning, and allow
yourself extra time to reach your destination.</description>
