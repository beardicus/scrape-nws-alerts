<description>...Slippery, Hazardous Travel In Snow Showers This Morning...
Snow covered roads with icy spots are making for slippery to
hazardous travel for many this morning, especially portions of
southeast Minnesota and western into north-central Wisconsin.
Bridges and overpasses are especially treacherous with melting
snow refreezing...resulting in icy conditions.
Bands of snow, with pockets of moderate to heavy snow, will
continue to rotate across and through the local area through late
morning. Visibilities in the heavy snow will quickly drop to 1/2
mile. Additional snowfall of up to 1&quot; is possible, mostly on cold
and grassy surfaces. In addition, winds will gust from 30 to 40
mph at times.
Numerous accidents and slide offs have already occurred this
morning. If you must travel, be prepared for the winter driving
conditions...especially across bridges and overpasses. Take it
slow and allow for ample time to reach your destination.</description>
