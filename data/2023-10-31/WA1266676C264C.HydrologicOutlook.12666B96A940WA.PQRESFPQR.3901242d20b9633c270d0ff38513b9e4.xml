<description>...HEAVY RAIN MAY CAUSE LOCALIZED FLOODING LATER THIS WEEK...
An atmospheric river of moisture will affect southwest Washington
and northwest Oregon Wednesday through Thursday as a well organized
frontal system slowly moves across the region. Latest model guidance
has increased the rainfall potential, with 1 to 2 inches of rain
expected for the interior lowlands, and up to 3 inches possible for
the coast. The heaviest rain will likely be in the Willapa Hills, as
well as the Coast Range and Cascades north of Oregon Highway 22,
where 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected and up to 5 inches
possible. The heaviest rain appears likely to occur Wednesday night
into Thursday morning.
The main concern with this event will be the potential for urban
flooding in areas of poor drainage. Officials and property owners
should do what they can to clear storm drains of fallen leaves today
before the rain arrives tomorrow. Recently burned areas are also of
concern, as rainfall rates may be sufficient to cause minor debris
flows. While a few small streams may jump their banks due to the
heavy rain, early season low flows should keep mainstem rivers from
flooding during this event.
After a brief break Thursday night, the next front and atmospheric
river are expected arrive later Friday. Latest indications are that
rainfall will not be as heavy with this second system, but this may
change as details become clearer.
Stay tuned to weather.gov/portland for the latest forecast and
warning information. This product will be updated by 4 PM Tuesday.</description>
