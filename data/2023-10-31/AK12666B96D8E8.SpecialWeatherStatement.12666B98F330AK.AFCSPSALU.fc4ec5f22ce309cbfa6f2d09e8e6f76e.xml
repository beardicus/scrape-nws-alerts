<description>...POTENTIAL FOR FREEZING RAIN WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY...
Below-freezing overnight temperatures in combination with warm
air moving in overhead may lead to light, intermittent freezing
rain through the Kuskokwim Delta beginning Wednesday night.
Temperatures warm during the day on Thursday, leading to a pause
in the threat of freezing rain. Low temperatures are likely to be
colder for Thursday night, leading to another chance for freezing
rain, with more widespread coverage. A colder airmass moves in on
Friday, transitioning precipitation to snow.
Overall, there is a moderate chance (around 50%) for locations in
the Kuskokwim Delta to observe freezing rain between Wednesday
night and Friday. However, precipitation amounts are expected to
be light, with areal coverage scattered and intermittent. As a
result, ice accumulations are most likely to be trace to a few
hundredths of an inch.</description>
