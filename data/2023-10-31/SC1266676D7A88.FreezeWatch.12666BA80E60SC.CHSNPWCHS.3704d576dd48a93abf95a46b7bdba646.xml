WEDNESDAY FOR LAKE MOULTRIE...
...FREEZE WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT
THROUGH THURSDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...For the Lake Wind Advisory, north winds 10 to 20 knots
with gusts up to 25 knots and waves 1 to 2 feet expected. For
the Freeze Watch, sub-freezing temperatures as low as 30 to 32
degrees.
* WHERE...Inland Berkeley County.
* WHEN...For the Lake Wind Advisory, from 4 AM to 8 PM EDT
Wednesday. For the Freeze Watch, from late Wednesday night
through Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Strong winds and rough waves on Lake Moultrie will
create hazardous conditions for small craft. Frost and freeze
conditions could kill crops, other sensitive vegetation and
possibly damage unprotected outdoor plumbing.</description>
<instruction>Boaters on Lake Moultrie should use extra caution since strong
winds and rough waves can overturn small craft.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
