PDT THURSDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 5 AM TO 11 PM
PDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 10
to 13 feet with dangerous rip currents. Highest waves are
expected on west and southwest facing beaches. For the Coastal
Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding expected around the
time of high tide.
* WHERE...San Luis Obispo County Beaches and Santa Barbara
County Central Coast Beaches.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, from 9 PM Tuesday to 2 AM
PDT Thursday. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 5 AM to 11
PM PDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely, around the time of
high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as
parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to
roads or structures is NOT expected. There is an increased
risk for ocean drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers and
surfers out to sea. Large breaking waves can cause injury,
wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats
near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...High tides are expected at 11 am and 1130
pm.</description>

NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
