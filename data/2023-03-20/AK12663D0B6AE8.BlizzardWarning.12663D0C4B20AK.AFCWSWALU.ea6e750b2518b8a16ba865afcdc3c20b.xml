<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM AKDT THIS
MORNING FOR THE KUSKOKWIM DELTA COAST AND NUNIVAK ISLAND...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions. Additional snow accumulations of up
to one inch. Winds gusting as high as 65 mph. Visibilities
reduced to one quarter mile or lower at times.
* WHERE...Kuskokwim Delta coast and Nunivak Island.
* WHEN...Until 10 AM AKDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be difficult. Areas of blowing snow to
significantly reduce visibility down to one quarter mile.
Power outages due to strong winds are possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The lowest visibilities are currently ongoing
along the coast. However, blowing snow may spread as far inland
as Bethel as snow pushes from west to east through the morning
hours today. By late morning, the front exits east and steady
snowfall will transition to snow showers. In combination with
warming temperatures, this will lead to an end to blizzard
conditions by midday.</description>
<instruction>A Blizzard Warning means severe winter weather conditions are
expected or occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds
and poor visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout
conditions, making travel very hazardous. If you must travel,
have a winter survival kit with you.</instruction>
