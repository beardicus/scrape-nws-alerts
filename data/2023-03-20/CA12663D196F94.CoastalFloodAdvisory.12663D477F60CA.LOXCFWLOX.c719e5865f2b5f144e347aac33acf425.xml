<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued March 20 at 9:13PM PDT until March 23 at 11:00PM PDT by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 2 AM WEDNESDAY TO
3 PM PDT THURSDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 5 AM WEDNESDAY
TO 11 PM PDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 6
to 10 feet with dangerous rip currents. Highest waves are
expected on west and southwest facing beaches. For the Coastal
Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding expected around the
time of high tide.
* WHERE...Ventura County Beaches.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, from 2 AM Wednesday to 3 PM
PDT Thursday. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 5 AM
Wednesday to 11 PM PDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely, around the time of
high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as
parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to
roads or structures is NOT expected. There is an increased
risk for ocean drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers and
surfers out to sea. Large breaking waves can cause injury,
wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats
near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...High tides on Wednesday are expected
between 10 and 11 am as well as 10 and 11 pm.</description>

NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
