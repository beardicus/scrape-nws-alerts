<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued December 25 at 10:54AM AKST until December 26 at 9:00AM AKST by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...STORM WILL BRING HEAVY SNOW TO THE HIGHWAYS...
.Up to 12 inches of snow has been reported along the Klondike
Highway this morning while the Haines Highway has seen mostly
rain. Temperatures are over achieving with much stronger warm air
advection associated with the storm than previously forecasted.
Snow levels have risen up to between 1,000 ft to 1,500 ft.
Temperatures are now expected to remain steady through the
afternoon, but then cool this evening as cold air advects over
the area. This will allow for some additional snow accumulation
this evening.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM AKST
TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow. Additional snow accumulations between 6 to 8
inches.
* WHERE...Haines Highway near Haines Customs.
* WHEN...Until 9 AM AKST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...As the front exits the Panhandle, cold air
is expected to advect over the border. This will allow for a
short period of heavy snow. Heaviest snow is expected late this
afternoon into this evening. If temperatures fail to cool,
little snow accumulation will occur.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water
with you in case of an emergency.
People are urged to prepare their property before the onset of
winter weather.
