<headline>Flood Advisory issued December 25 at 11:42PM EST  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 1115 AM EST TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of western North Carolina, including the
following counties, Henderson and Polk.
* WHEN...Until 1115 AM EST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks, greenways,
boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and parking lots.
Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.  A few flood-
prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1116 PM EST, Light to moderate rainfall has persisted
across Henderson and Polk counties since yesterday morning.
Doppler radar and automated gauges indicate 2-4 inches of
rain has accumulated over the past 12 hours.  Area streams
are gradually rising and some are approaching bankfull or
Action/Advisory Stage.  At these levels nuisance flooding of
adjacent low-lying areas is beginning.  Additional streams
are likely to exceed bankfull levels during the overnight
hours as rainfall and runoff continues.  This includes the N
Pacolet River and Green River.  Therefore, a Flood Advisory
has been issued and will remain in place through at least
Tuesday morning.
Mud Creek from Crail Farm Rd to Erkwood Dr to White St and S
Center Plaza to the Oklawaha Greenway is exceeding its banks
and starting to flood adjacent low-lying areas.  The
following streamgauge is above Action/Advisory Stage,
resulting in nuisance flooding along Mud Creek...
ID: MNMN7
NAME: at N Main St, 1 N Hendersonville
CURRENT STAGE: 11.06 feet
ACTION/ADVISORY STAGE: 11.5
MINOR FLOOD STAGE: 14.0
TREND: Rising Steadily
FORECAST: Mud Creek is expected to continue to rise past
Action/Advisory Stage before 1 AM and may exceed Minor Flood
Stage later Tuesday morning.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches is expected
through Tuesday afternoon, with isolated totals exceeding 4
inches possible.  This additional rainfall will likely cause
area streams to approach and exceed Minor Flood Stage,
resulting in more significant lowland flooding.  If these
conditions develop, a Flood Warning may be issued.  Steps to
protect vulnerable property adjacent to streams should be
taken before flood waters develop and rise.
Areas of heavier rainfall are also possible through Tuesday
afternoon.  Intense rainfall rates may result in an
acceleration of stream rises as upper soils are already
saturated from earlier rainfall.  This may cause flash
flooding to develop and a Flash Flood Warning may be
necessary.  If rapid stream rises are observed, avoid all
low-lying areas near streams and be prepared to seek higher
ground.
- Some locations that may experience nuisance flooding
include...
Hendersonville, Columbus, Flat Rock, Etowah, Mountain Home,
Laurel Park, Tryon, Saluda, Dupont State Forest, Valley Hill,
Dana, Lake Adger, East Flat Rock, Mill Spring, Tuxedo, Crab
Creek and Green Creek.</description>
<instruction>Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
