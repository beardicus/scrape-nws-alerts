<headline>Flood Watch issued December 25 at 2:35PM EST  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of western North Carolina, including the
following counties, Avery, Mitchell and Yancey.
* WHEN...Through Tuesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Deep moisture across the area and strong southeasterly low
level flow will lead to heavy rainfall today through Tuesday
morning. Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are also
possible which could increase rainfall rates where they
develop. Amounts of 3 to 5 inches with locally higher totals
are expected through Tuesday morning which could lead to
flooding, especially locations along and near the Blue Ridge
where upslope flow could enhance rainfall rates.

<instruction>A Flood Watch means there is a potential for flooding based on
current forecasts. Please monitor the latest forecasts and be alert
for possible Flood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding
should be prepared to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
