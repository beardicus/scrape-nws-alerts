and hazardous surf conditions. Breakers up to 20 feet.
* WHERE...South Washington Coast.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, through this evening.
For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 9 AM this morning to 1 PM
PST this afternoon. For the High Surf Advisory, from 9 PM this
evening to 6 AM PST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor flooding, up to
one foot above ground level, during high tides is expected in
the low lying areas near bays, sloughs, and the lower reaches of
the coastal rivers. A total tide of 11 ft is forecasted at Toke
Point. This typically begins to result in water rising up to
Highway 101 near Raymond.
* IMPACTS...For the High Surf Advisory...Waves may wash over
beaches, jetties, and other structures unexpectedly. People can
be swept off rocks and jetties and drown while observing high
surf. Minor beach erosion may damage coastal properties and
buildings. Higher than normal water run-up is expected on
beaches and low-lying shoreline. The threat of sneaker waves is
particularly elevated when high surf conditions are met. Please
use caution when venturing to area beaches, jetties and
headlands.</description>
<instruction>A Coastal Flood Advisory means that tidal overflow flooding is
expected. Coastal residents in the warned area should be alert
for rising water, and take appropriate action to protect life and
property.
A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches,
producing rip currents, sneaker waves and beach erosion. Stay
well back from the water`s edge and be alert for exceptionally
high waves.
Keep away from large logs on the beach. Water running up on the
beach can easily lift or roll logs which can injure or kill
someone caught in their path.
Remain out of the water to avoid hazardous swimming conditions.</instruction>
