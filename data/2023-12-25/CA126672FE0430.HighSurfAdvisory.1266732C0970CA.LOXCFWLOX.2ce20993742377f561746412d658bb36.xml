<headline>High Surf Advisory issued December 25 at 1:40PM PST until December 28 at 3:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 PM PST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Large breaking waves of 9 to 11 feet through Wednesday
night. Local sets to 13 feet this afternoon. Surf building to 15
to 19 feet Thursday. Dangerous rip currents can be expected.
* WHERE...San Luis Obispo County Beaches and Santa Barbara
County Central Coast Beaches.
* WHEN...Until 3 PM PST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...There is an increased risk for ocean drowning. Rip
currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Large
breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and
rocks, and capsize small boats near shore. Pooling of sea water
is possible around high tide at beach and harbor areas that is
uncommon with normal tidal ranges. Enhanced beach erosion is
also possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Very large surf is expected to continue
Thursday night through at least Saturday. This very large surf
combined with relatively high tides of 6.0 to 6.5 feet may
result in more significant coastal flooding and beach erosion.
This could require the issuance of a coastal flood advisory as
we draw closer to the event.</description>
<instruction>Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly
locations in such conditions, so stay off the rocks.</instruction>
