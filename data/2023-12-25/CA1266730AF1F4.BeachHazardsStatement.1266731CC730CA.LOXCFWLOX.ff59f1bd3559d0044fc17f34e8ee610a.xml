...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH WEDNESDAY
AFTERNOON...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM THURSDAY TO 9 PM PST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Abnormally high tides around 7 feet are expected each
morning through Wednesday. For the High Surf Advisory, large
breaking waves of 7 to 12 feet are expected Thursday into
Saturday. Local sets of 15 to 20 feet will be likely near Point
Conception.
* WHERE...Catalina and Santa Barbara Islands, Santa Barbara
County Southwestern Coast, Santa Barbara County Southeastern
Coast, Malibu Coast and Los Angeles County Beaches.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, through Wednesday
afternoon. For the High Surf Advisory, from 9 AM Thursday to 9
PM PST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Pooling of sea water is possible around high tide at
beach and harbor areas that is uncommon with normal tidal
ranges. No significant damage is expected through Wednesday.
Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches
and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore. There is an
increased risk of ocean drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers
and surfers out to sea. Waves can wash people off beaches and
rocks, and capsize small boats nearshore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...High tides will occur each morning
between 800 AM and 900 AM. Later on, large surf is expected
Thursday through at least Saturday. During this time, there is
the potential for surf up to 10 feet across west facing
beaches of Los Angeles County. This very large surf combined
with relatively high tides of 6.2 to 6.6 feet may result in
more significant coastal flooding and beach erosion. This
could require the issuance of a coastal flood advisory as we
draw closer to the event.</description>
<instruction>Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
