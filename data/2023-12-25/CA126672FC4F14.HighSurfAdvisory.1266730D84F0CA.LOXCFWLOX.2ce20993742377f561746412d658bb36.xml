<headline>High Surf Advisory issued December 25 at 2:21AM PST until December 26 at 3:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 PM PST TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Large breaking waves of 9 to 12 feet, with local sets to
13 feet and dangerous rip currents. Surf peaking on Monday.
Abnormally high tides each morning around 7.0 feet are expected.
* WHERE...San Luis Obispo County Beaches and Santa Barbara
County Central Coast Beaches.
* WHEN...Until 3 PM PST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...There is an increased risk for ocean drowning. Rip
currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Large
breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and
rocks, and capsize small boats near shore. Pooling of sea
water is possible around high tide at beach and harbor areas
that is uncommon with normal tidal ranges. Enhanced beach
erosion is also possible. No significant damage is expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...High tides will occur each morning between
700 AM and 830 AM. Surf will build rapidly this morning up to 13
feet. Later on, very large surf is expected late Wednesday night
through at least Saturday. During this time, there is the
potential for warning level surf of 20 feet. This very large
surf combined with relatively high tides of 6.0 to 6.5 feet, may
result in more significant coastal flooding and beach erosion.
This could require the issuance of a coastal flood advisory as
we draw closer to the event.</description>
<instruction>Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly
locations in such conditions, so stay off the rocks.</instruction>
