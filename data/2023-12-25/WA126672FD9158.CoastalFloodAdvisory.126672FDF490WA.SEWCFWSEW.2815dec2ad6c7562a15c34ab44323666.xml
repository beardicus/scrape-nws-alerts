<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued December 25 at 10:46AM PST until December 25 at 1:00PM PST by NWS Seattle</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM PST THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Minor coastal flooding. Inundation of up to two feet
above ground level is possible along shorelines and low-lying
coastal areas.
* WHERE...North Coast and Central Coast zones, including areas
around La Push and Westport.
* WHEN...Until 1 PM PST this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Minor coastal flooding due to tidal overflow is
expected around high tide. This may lead to flooding of
parking lots, parks, and roads, with only isolated road
closures expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...High tide is occuring or will occur within
the next hour, and is likely being enhanced by the large waves.
This may lead to lingering minor tidal overflow impacts for an
hour or two after high tide.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inundation above ground level refers to the height above the Mean
Higher High Water (MHHW) level.</instruction>
