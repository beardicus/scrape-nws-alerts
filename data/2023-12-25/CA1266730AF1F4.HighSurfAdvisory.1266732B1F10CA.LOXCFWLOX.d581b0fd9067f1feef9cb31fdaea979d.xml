<headline>High Surf Advisory issued December 25 at 10:13PM PST until December 28 at 9:00AM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH TUESDAY
MORNING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM TUESDAY TO 9 AM PST
THURSDAY...
...HIGH SURF WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM THURSDAY TO 9 PM PST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents
and breaking waves due to elevated surf. For the High Surf
Advisory, large breaking waves of 7 to 10 feet are expected
Tuesday night into Wednesday. For the High Surf Warning,
dangerously large and potentially damaging breaking waves of 10
to 15 feet with local sets to 18 feet are likely, along with
dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Ventura County Beaches.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, through Tuesday
morning. For the High Surf Advisory, from 9 PM Tuesday to 9 AM
PST Thursday. For the High Surf Warning, from 9 AM Thursday to
9 PM PST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Powerful waves and strong rip currents will pose an
exceptional risk of ocean drowning and damage to coastal
structures like piers and jetties, especially Thursday through
Saturday evening. Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash
people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near
shore. There is an increased risk of ocean drowning. Rip
currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Waves can
wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats
nearshore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The highest surf during the warning period
will likely be near Ventura Harbor. Coastal flooding and beach
erosion will likely be more significant Thursday through
Saturday, especially during times of high tide. A coastal flood
advisory will likely need to be issued as we draw closer to the
event due to this increased risk of more significant coastal
flood impacts. This very large surf combined with relatively
high tides of 6.0 to 6.7 feet may result in more significant
coastal flooding and beach erosion.</description>
<instruction>Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other water side
infrastructure.
Remain out of the water due to hazardous swimming conditions, or
stay near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly
in such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
