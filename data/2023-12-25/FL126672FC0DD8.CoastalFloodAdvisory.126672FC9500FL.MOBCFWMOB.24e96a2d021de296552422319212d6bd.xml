<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued December 25 at 3:54AM EST until December 25 at 7:00AM EST by NWS Mobile</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM CST EARLY THIS
MORNING...
...HIGH SURF WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM CST THIS
MORNING...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH TUESDAY
AFTERNOON...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM THIS MORNING TO
9 PM CST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding.
For the High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking waves of
6 to 9 feet in the surf zone. For the High Rip Current Risk,
dangerous rip currents. For the High Surf Advisory, large
breaking waves of 4 to 7 feet expected in the surf zone.
* WHERE...In Alabama, Mobile Coastal and Baldwin Coastal
Counties. In Florida, Escambia Coastal, Santa Rosa Coastal and
Okaloosa Coastal Counties.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 6 AM CST early
this morning. For the High Surf Warning, until 9 AM CST this
morning. For the High Rip Current Risk, through Tuesday
afternoon. For the High Surf Advisory, from 9 AM this morning
to 9 PM CST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Breaking waves can sweep
people off jetties and docks, and into dangerous seas. Life-
threatening swimming conditions and significant beach erosion
can be expected. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers
away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Significant wave runup and over-wash may
occur along Gulf Front beaches, particularly in the Gulf
Islands National Seashore area between Fort Pickens and
Pensacola Beach. Wave runup and over-wash through the dune
system can result in some minor flooding impacts on Fort
Pickens Road, although the road usually remains open and
passable..</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other waterside
infrastructure.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
