<headline>High Surf Warning issued December 25 at 10:13PM PST until December 30 at 9:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 AM PST THURSDAY...
...HIGH SURF WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM THURSDAY TO 9 PM PST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 10 to
13 feet with dangerous rip currents. Local sets to 15 feet
tonight. For the High Surf Warning, dangerously large and
potentially damaging breaking waves of 17 to 22 feet with local
sets to 25 feet are likely, along with dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...San Luis Obispo County Beaches and Santa Barbara
County Central Coast Beaches.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 3 AM PST Thursday.
For the High Surf Warning, from 3 AM Thursday to 9 PM PST
Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Powerful waves and strong rip currents will pose an
exceptional risk of ocean drowning and damage to coastal
structures like piers and jetties, especially Thursday through
Saturday. Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off
beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The highest surf will be across west facing
beaches. Coastal flooding and beach erosion will likely be more
significant Thursday through Saturday, especially during times
of high tide. A coastal flood advisory will likely need to be
issued as we draw closer to the event due to this increased risk
of more significant coastal flood impacts. This very large surf
combined with relatively high tides of 5.7 to 6.4 feet may
result in more significant coastal flooding and beach erosion.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other water side
infrastructure.</description>
