<headline>Flood Watch issued December 25 at 10:33PM EST until further notice by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH TUESDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of northeast Georgia, including the following
areas, Habersham, Rabun and Stephens, western North Carolina,
including the following areas, Eastern Polk, Greater Rutherford,
Henderson, Macon, Polk Mountains, Rutherford Mountains, Southern
Jackson and Transylvania, and upstate South Carolina, including
the following areas, Central Greenville, Greater Oconee, Greater
Pickens, Greenville Mountains, Northern Spartanburg, Oconee
Mountains and Pickens Mountains.
* WHEN...Through Tuesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Deep moisture across the area and strong southeasterly low
level flow will lead to heavy rainfall today through Tuesday
afternoon. Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are also
possible which could increase rainfall rates where they
develop. Amounts of 3 to 6 inches with locally higher totals
are expected through Tuesday morning which could lead to
flooding, especially locations along and near the Blue Ridge
Escarpment where upslope flow could enhance rainfall rates.

<instruction>A Flood Watch means there is a potential for flooding based on
current forecasts. Please monitor the latest forecasts and be alert
for possible Flood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding
should be prepared to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
