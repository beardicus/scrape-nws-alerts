<headline>High Surf Advisory issued December 25 at 1:40PM PST until December 28 at 3:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH TUESDAY
MORNING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM TUESDAY TO 3 PM PST
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, abnormally high tide
around 7.0 feet. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking
waves up to 7 feet Wednesday building to 10 to 14 feet Thursday
with dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Ventura County Beaches.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, through Tuesday
morning. For the High Surf Advisory, from 9 PM Tuesday to 3 PM
PST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...There is an increased risk for ocean drowning. Rip
currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Large
breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and
rocks, and capsize small boats near shore. Pooling of sea water
is possible around high tide at beach and harbor areas that is
uncommon with normal tidal ranges. Enhanced beach erosion is
also possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Astronomical high tide around 7.0 feet is
expected Tuesday morning around 800 AM. Large surf is expected
to continue Thursday night through at least Saturday. The large
surf combined with relatively high tides of 6.2 to 6.6 feet may
result in more significant coastal flooding and beach erosion.
This could require the issuance of a coastal flood advisory as
we draw closer to the event.</description>
<instruction>Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
