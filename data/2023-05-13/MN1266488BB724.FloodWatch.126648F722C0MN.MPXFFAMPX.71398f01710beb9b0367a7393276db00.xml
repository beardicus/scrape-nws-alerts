<headline>Flood Watch issued May 13 at 3:01AM CDT until May 20 at 7:00AM CDT by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>.Rounds of heavy rain are expected this morning and again later this
afternoon and tonight across southern Minnesota. Widespread totals
of 2 to 3 inches are expected with localized areas over 5 inches
possible. This is the same region that received 2 to 4 inches
Wednesday night into Thursday morning. The recent heavy rain, and
the snow melt from a few weeks ago, have left soils saturated and
susceptible to flooding with any additional heavy rainfall.

* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of south central Minnesota, including the
following county, Martin.
* WHEN...Through Sunday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rounds of heavy rainfall could produce totals of 2 to 3
inches, with isolated locations receiving in excess of 5
inches. This will lead to the possibility of flash flooding.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action
should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.</instruction>
