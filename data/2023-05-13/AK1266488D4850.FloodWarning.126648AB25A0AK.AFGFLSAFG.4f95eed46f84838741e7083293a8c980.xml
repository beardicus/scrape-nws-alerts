SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues.
* WHERE...Yukon River at Eagle.
* WHEN...Until noon AKDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding is occuring in low lying areas around Eagle. A
surge of water and ice moved past early this morning and pushed
water and ice overbank. Some structures along the edge of the
river were impacted by high water. Water is still over the road
between town and Eagle Village.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 800 AM AKDT,a resident in Eagle reports the river is
mostly ice free at this time and the water has receded since
the crest this morning. Water levels will continue to
fluctuate as ice runs move past the community. Water levels
could increase and go overbank again if a new ice jam forms
downriver from Eagle.
