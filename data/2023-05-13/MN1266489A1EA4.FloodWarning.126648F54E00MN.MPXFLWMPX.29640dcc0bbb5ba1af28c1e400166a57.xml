<description>...The National Weather Service in the Twin Cities has issued a
Flood Warning for the following rivers in Minnesota...
Cottonwood River Above Springfield affecting Brown County.
.Accumulating rainfall has occurred across southern Minnesota Friday
night into this evening. Totals so far have reached 2 to even 4 plus
inches in some localized areas with additional rainfall expected
tonight. This has caused area rivers to rapidly rise. Crests should
occur within the next few days before a dry pattern this coming week
allows for rivers to decrease again.

EVENING...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is forecast.

* WHEN...From late Sunday night to Friday evening.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...

early Monday morning to a crest of 26.5 feet Tuesday morning.
It will then fall below flood stage early Friday morning.
- Flood stage is 22.0 feet.

26.5 feet on 03/13/2007.
