- Ice jams have been forming and releasing on the Yukon River
upstream of Circle. These ice jams have caused a range of
flooding from major to minor impacts at some locations along
the Yukon River. The first surge of water from one of these
ice jams is expected to arrive in Circle this evening or
early Sunday morning. A second surge from a large ice jam
that was in place upstream of Eagle is expected to arrive
late Sunday night or Monday morning.
