<headline>Flood Warning issued May 13 at 9:39PM CDT until further notice by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in the Twin Cities has issued a
Flood Warning for the following rivers in Minnesota...
Minnesota River at Henderson MN19 affecting Scott, Le Sueur and
Sibley Counties.
.Accumulating rainfall has occurred across southern Minnesota Friday
night into this evening. Totals so far have reached 2 to even 4 plus
inches in some localized areas with additional rainfall expected
tonight. This has caused area rivers to rapidly rise. Crests should
occur within the next few days before a dry pattern this coming week
allows for rivers to decrease again.

NOTICE...

* WHEN...From late Sunday night until further notice.
* IMPACTS...At 736.8 feet, Highway 22 east of St Peter closed

- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above flood stage
early Monday morning and continue rising to a crest of 735.8
feet Thursday morning.
