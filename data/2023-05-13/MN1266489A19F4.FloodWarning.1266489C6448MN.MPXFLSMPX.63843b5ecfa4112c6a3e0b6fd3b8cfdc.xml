<headline>Flood Warning issued May 13 at 9:29PM CDT until further notice by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in
Minnesota...
Minnesota River at Morton affecting Renville and Redwood Counties.
.Accumulating rainfall has occurred across southern Minnesota Friday
night into this evening. Totals so far have reached 2 to even 4 plus
inches in some localized areas with additional rainfall expected
tonight. This has caused river levels in this region to either
rapidly rise or delay falling. Crests should occur within the next
few days before a dry pattern this coming week allows for river
decreases again.

forecast.
