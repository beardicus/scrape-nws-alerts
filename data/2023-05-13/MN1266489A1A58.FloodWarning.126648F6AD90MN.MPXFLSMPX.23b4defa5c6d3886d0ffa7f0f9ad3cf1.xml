<description>...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in
Minnesota...
Cottonwood River at New Ulm affecting Brown County.
.Accumulating rainfall has occurred across southern Minnesota Friday
night into this evening. Totals so far have reached 2 to even 4 plus
inches in some localized areas with additional rainfall expected
tonight. This has caused river levels in this region to either
rapidly rise or delay falling. Crests should occur within the next
few days before a dry pattern this coming week allows for rivers to
decrease again.

forecast.

- Recent Activity...The maximum river stage in the 24 hours
ending at 900 PM CDT Saturday was 12.0 feet.
