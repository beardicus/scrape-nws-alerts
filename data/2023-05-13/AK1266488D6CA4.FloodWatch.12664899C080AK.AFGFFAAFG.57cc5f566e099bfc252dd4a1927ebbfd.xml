<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues to be possible.
* WHERE...The Tanana River at Manley Hot Springs
* WHEN...Through Sunday morning.
* IMPACTS...Water levels are running high and going overbank in some
low lying areas along the Tanana River near Manley Hot Springs.
Fluctuating water levels have caused flooding of the parking lot
at Manley Landing on the Tanana River. Ice jam flooding is
possible and has a high uncertainty. Impacts could range between
localized high water or significant flooding. Large chunks of ice
could push overbank along the Tanana River.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A local pilot reported that an ice jam 6 miles downriver from
Manley Hot Springs was starting to deteriorate on Friday
afternoon. It is possible another ice jam could develop 12
miles downriver from Manley Hot Springs where ice was still
in place. In addition, the river gauge on Manley Hot Spring
Slough is showing water levels continuing to rise and are
within a foot of reaching flood stage as of Saturday morning.

items to higher ground and prepare for possible flooding.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
