<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued October 18 at 12:14AM EDT until October 18 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Marquette</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Heavy, wet snow will continue into Tuesday, mainly
inland from Lake Superior, resulting in poor travel
conditions. Additional snow accumulations of 4 to 12 inches
are expected in the higher terrain a few miles inland from
Lake Superior with locally higher totals approaching 14 inches
possible across the Michigamme Highlands. Near the shoreline,
little or no snow accumulation will occur due to rain only or
rain mixing with the snow at times. Winds gusting as high as
45 mph through this evening then as high as 50 mph into
Tuesday.
* WHERE...Baraga and Marquette Counties.
* WHEN...Until 8 PM EDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible in some
high terrain areas. The hazardous conditions will impact the
evening commute today and the Tuesday morning commute. Gusty
winds and wet snow could bring down tree branches, resulting
in potentially widespread power outages.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Since this is the first winter storm of
the season, extra caution is urged for those who must travel.</description>
