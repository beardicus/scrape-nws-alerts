<headline>Coastal Flood Watch issued September 13 at 10:40AM EDT until September 16 at 12:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT SATURDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 10 to
15 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards Statement,
dangerous rip currents and large breaking waves expected in the
surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Watch, 2 to 4 feet of
inundation above ground level possible in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways around high tide.
* WHERE...Hatteras Island.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT Saturday.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, from 8 AM EDT this morning
through this evening. For the Coastal Flood Watch, from
Thursday afternoon through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Numerous roads may be closed, including portions of
NC 12. Low lying property including homes, businesses, and some
critical infrastructure may be inundated. Some shoreline erosion
may occur. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore
break can throw a swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom
causing neck and back injuries.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Minor inundation possible this afternoon
into Thursday, peaking Thursday evening through Saturday,
especially around times of high tide. The most critical factor
in this event will be the powerful ocean wave run up, which will
bring seawater up and over vulnerable dune structures, across
roads, and onto properties.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
