SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Lee is forecast to pass offshore of southern New England on
Saturday but its impacts will extend far from the storm`s center. Lee
should bring rough surf and possible storm surge flooding, damaging
winds, and bands of heavy rain to at least coastal areas of
Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
The following are the primary hazards of concern with Lee:
* Damaging wind - Winds will increase on Friday and remain gusty
through Saturday night. Tropical storm force winds are possible late
Friday night and Saturday near the coast, where downed branches or
trees are possible since trees are fully leafed and root systems may
be weakened from saturated soils. These winds and high seas will
also be dangerous for mariners.
* Storm surge - Life-threatening storm surge flooding is possible on
the bay side of Cape Cod and the northern side of Nantucket,
including Nantucket Harbor, late Friday and Saturday. In addition,
ocean beaches will experience dangerous rip currents and significant
beach erosion through the weekend.
* Flooding rainfall - Bands of heavy rain may result in flash flooding
Friday night and Saturday, mainly near the coast. Rainfall totals of
2 to 4 inches are possible in a short period of time.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
coastal Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Potential impacts in this
area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across Southern New England, little to no impact is
anticipated.
* SURGE:
Prepare for life-threatening surge having possible significant impacts
across the bay side of Cape Cod and the northern side of Nantucket,
including Nantucket Harbor. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Sections of coastal roadways and secondary roads become flooded
and impassable, especially in usually vulnerable low spots.
- Significant beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes.
Strong and numerous rip currents.
Also, prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across the rest of the eastern Massachusetts coast. This
includes minor inundation of coastal roads and low lying areas.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across eastern Massachusetts. Potential impacts
include:
- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter currents.
Small streams, creeks, and ditches may become swollen and
overflow in spots.
- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually
vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding of water
occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become
near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge
closures.
Elsewhere across Southern New England, little to no impact is
anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies
kit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your
home or business.
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
near the ocean, in a low-lying or poor drainage area, or near an
already swollen river, plan to move to safe shelter on higher ground.
When securing your property, outside preparations should be concluded
as soon as possible before conditions deteriorate. The onset of strong
gusty winds or flooding can cause certain preparedness activities to
become unsafe.
Check on those who may not be fully aware of the situation or who are
unable to make personal preparations.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news outlets
for official storm information. Listen for possible changes to the
forecast.
