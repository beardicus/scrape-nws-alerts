SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Lee has begun to move north today which will continue
through the end of the week, bringing it into the Gulf of Maine late
Friday night or early Saturday. As the storm moves north, it is
expected to weaken, but the wind field will expand significantly.
Therefore, the potential exists for tropical storm conditions to
develop by Friday afternoon...continuing Friday night through Saturday
afternoon. The strongest winds are expected across coastal portions of
western Maine and New Hampshire.
Large, pounding surf in addition to one to three feet of storm surge
will bring the potential for beach erosion and minor to moderate
coastal flooding.
Heavy rainfall is also possible, particularly across Midcoast Maine
where localized flooding will be possible.
There remains some uncertainty with regards to the track of Lee, which
will play a role in the level of impacts experienced a. cross the
area, but confidence is higher the further east you move. Please check
back frequently for the latest updates.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for dangerous wind having possible significant impacts across
coastal New Hampshire and Maine. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes are damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured
lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Numerous large trees snapped or uprooted, leading to downed
power lines.
- Many roads are impassable from debris, caused by downed trees
and power lines. Many bridges, causeways, and access routes
impassable.
- Numerous power and communications outages likely.
Also, prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts
across interior areas of Maine and the higher elevations.
Elsewhere across NEW HAMPSHIRE AND WESTERN MAINE, little to no impact
is anticipated.
* SURGE:
Prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited impacts
across vulnerable low lying areas of coastal New Hampshire and Maine.
Potential impacts in this area include:
- Localized inundation of up to 2 feet mainly along low-lying
spots on the immediate shorelines and in tidal affected
riverine areas farther inland. Storm surge flooding could be
accentuated by large waves in vulnerable wave action shoreline
locations.
- Sections of near-shore roads, causeways, and parking lots
become overspread with surge water. Dangerous driving
conditions in places where surge water covers the road.
- Minor to moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching
dunes, mainly in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip
currents.
- Minor damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. A few
small craft broken away from moorings. No damage to revetments
expected.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant
impacts across central Maine. Potential impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals, and
ditches will overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
will become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
Prepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across western Maine.
* TORNADOES:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time across NEW HAMPSHIRE
AND WESTERN MAINE.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
WATCH/WARNING PHASE - If evacuating the area, stick to prescribed
evacuation routes. Look for additional traffic information on roadway
smart signs and listen to select radio channels for further travel
instructions. Drivers should not use cell phones while operating
vehicles.
WATCH/WARNING PHASE - For those not under evacuation orders,
understand that there are inherent risks to evacuation (such as
traffic congestion, accidents, and driving in bad weather), so
evacuate only if necessary. Help keep roadways open for those that
are under evacuation orders.
WATCH/WARNING PHASE - If evacuating away from the area or relocating
to a nearby shelter, leave early before weather conditions become
hazardous.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and take necessary
actions to secure your home or business. Deliberate efforts should be
underway to protect life and property. Ensure that your Emergency
Supplies Kit is stocked and ready.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track as there are inherent forecast uncertainties
which must be taken into account.
If you live in a place that is particularly vulnerable to high wind,
such as a mobile home, an upper floor of a high rise building, or on
a boat, plan to move to safe shelter. Take enough supplies for you
and your family for several days.
Always heed the advice of local officials and comply with any orders
that are issued. Do not needlessly jeopardize your life or the lives
of others.
When securing your property, outside preparations should be conducted
as soon as possible before conditions deteriorate. The onset of
strong gusty winds and heavy rain can cause certain preparedness
activities to become unsafe.
Visitors to the area should become familiar with nearby surroundings.
If you are a visitor, know the name of the county in which
you are located and where it is relative to current watches and
warnings. If staying at a hotel, ask the management staff about their
onsite disaster plan. Listen for evacuation orders, especially
pertaining to area visitors.
Closely monitor NOAA Weather Radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for possible changes to the
forecast.
