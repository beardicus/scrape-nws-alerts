<headline>Flood Watch issued September 13 at 3:29PM EDT until September 13 at 6:00PM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of southern Connecticut, including the following
areas, Northern Fairfield and Southern Fairfield.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM EDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Storm drains
and ditches may become clogged with debris.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- This area received heavy rain from earlier today so excessive
runoff will more easily occur in this area. Also, this area
has a greater likelihood of showers and thunderstorms
containing heavy rain going through the remainder of this
afternoon, so the threat for flash flooding continues.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
