<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
In addition to torrential rains, strong winds and hail can also be
expected. Accumulation of small hail on roads can create very slick
and hazardous driving conditions.
Do not underestimate the power of flood waters. Only a few inches of
rapidly flowing water can quickly carry away your vehicle.</instruction>
