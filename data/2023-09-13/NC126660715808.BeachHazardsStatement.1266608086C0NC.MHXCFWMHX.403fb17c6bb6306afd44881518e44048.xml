<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued September 13 at 8:50PM EDT until September 14 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM EDT FRIDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM EDT THURSDAY
THROUGH THURSDAY EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM THURSDAY TO
NOON EDT SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 9 to
13 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards Statement,
dangerous rip currents, large breaking waves expected, and
strong longshore currents in the surf zone. For the Coastal
Flood Warning, 2 to 4 feet of inundation above ground level
expected in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...East Carteret County.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 6 PM EDT Friday. For
the Beach Hazards Statement, from 8 AM EDT Thursday through
Thursday evening. For the Coastal Flood Warning, from 4 PM
Thursday to noon EDT Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Numerous roads may be closed. Low lying property
including homes, businesses, and some critical infrastructure
will be inundated. Some shoreline erosion will occur. Dangerous
swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw a swimmer or
surfer head first into the bottom causing neck and back
injuries. Strong longshore currents will create dangerous
swimming conditions.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
