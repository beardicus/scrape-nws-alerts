<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM EDT THIS MORNING THROUGH
THURSDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of northern Connecticut, including the following
areas, Hartford CT, Tolland CT and Windham CT. Portions of
Massachusetts, including the following areas, Central Middlesex
MA, Eastern Essex MA, Eastern Franklin MA, Eastern Hampden MA,
Eastern Hampshire MA, Eastern Norfolk MA, Eastern Plymouth MA,
Northern Bristol MA, Northern Middlesex MA, Northern Worcester MA,

* WHEN...From 11 AM EDT this morning through Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Highly saturated conditions continue across much of Southern
New England, and some locations are still recovering from
severe flooding that occurred on Monday. A slow moving
frontal system moving in will bring another round of slow-
moving downpours and embedded thunderstorms from west to
east. One to two inches of rain are forecast, although
localized amounts up to four inches are possible. This will
worsen existing flooding and/or trigger new areas of
flooding.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
