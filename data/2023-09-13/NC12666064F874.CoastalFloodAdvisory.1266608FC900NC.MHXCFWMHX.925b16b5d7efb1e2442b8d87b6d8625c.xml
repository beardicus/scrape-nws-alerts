<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued September 13 at 3:41PM EDT until September 15 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM EDT FRIDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM THURSDAY TO 8 PM
EDT FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 6 to
10 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards Statement,
dangerous rip currents and large breaking waves in the surf
zone. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, 1 to 2 feet of inundation
above ground level expected in low- lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...West Carteret and Coastal Onslow Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 6 PM EDT Friday. For
the Beach Hazards Statement, until 8 PM EDT this evening. For
the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 4 PM Thursday to 8 PM EDT
Friday.
* IMPACTS...Up to 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in a low threat of property damage. Some roads and low
lying property including parking lots, parks, lawns, and homes
adjacent to the waterfront will experience shallow flooding.
Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach
erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from
shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw a
swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom causing neck and
back injuries.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
