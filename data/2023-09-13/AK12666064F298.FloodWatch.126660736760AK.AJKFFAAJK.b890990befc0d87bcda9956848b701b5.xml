<headline>Flood Watch issued September 13 at 11:26AM AKDT  by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY MORNING THROUGH
FRIDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...The following areas, Central Inner Channels and Eastern
Gulf Coast. This includes the cities of Sitka, Juneau, And
Petersburg.
* WHEN...From Thursday morning through Friday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, other low-lying areas and flood-prone locations.
Some landslides in steeper terrain could be possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- An atmospheric river will bring heavy rainfall in the range
of 2 to 4 inches to the central and northern panhandle.
Heaviest rainfall is expected for the northern panhandle
starting Wed night and continuing into Thursday. For the
central panhandle, the heaviest rainfall will start early
Thursday morning and continue into Thursday night. Minor
flooding is possible especially for the smaller streams.
There is some uncertainty on when exactly the rainfall will
end with the earliest end being Thursday night, but the rain
could last into early Friday with enhanced effects due to the
longer duration of the rainfall.
In addition, the heavy rainfall combined with some gusty
winds from this system could cause some steeper mountain
slopes to become unstable. Be alert for some possible
landslides.
- Stay away from steep barren hillsides due to the landslide
danger.
- All residents on or near mountain slopes should be prepared for
possible landslides.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
