<headline>Red Flag Warning issued April 09 at 5:21AM MDT until April 10 at 8:00PM MDT by NWS El Paso</headline>
<description>...AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS FOR
TODAY THROUGH AT LEAST MONDAY DUE TO STRONG WINDS, VERY LOW
HUMIDITY, WARMER THAN NORMAL TEMPERATURES, AND DEEP INSTABILITY...
.After a couple of relatively calm days, winds will be on the
increase this afternoon. We will see sustained winds of 20 to 30
mph in area mountains and that combined with low min RH`s near
10%, has prompted a Red Flag warning to be issued for this
afternoon. Most lowland locations will see near Red Flag
conditions as well. For Sunday we will see more wide spread windy
conditions with very low min RH`s, so a Red Flag warning is in
effect for both the mountains and the lowlands on Sunday
afternoon. Our winds and dry conditions will continue on Monday
so a Fire Weather watch has been issued for Monday as well. An
approaching upper level storm system will give us even stronger
winds on Tuesday.

MDT THIS EVENING FOR STRONG WINDS AND LOW HUMIDITY FOR FIRE
