<headline>Red Flag Warning issued April 09 at 2:53PM CDT until April 09 at 10:00PM CDT by NWS Brownsville</headline>
<description>...ELEVATED TO CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS LIKELY TODAY
ACROSS MOST OF DEEP SOUTH TEXAS...
.Relative humidity values will range from 20 to 25 percent across
much of the inland areas of Deep South Texas through this
afternoon, with 25 to 40 percent along the lower Texas coast. As
low pressure deepens across the Plains States, expect south to
southeasterly winds to continue to remain gusty this afternoon and
evening. Gusty southerly winds combined with low humidity between
20 to 40 percent will lead to the potential for elevated to
critical fire weather conditions again Sunday. Burning of any kind
should be avoided.

EVENING FOR WINDS, VERY DRY FUELS, AND LOW RELATIVE
HUMIDITY FOR PORTIONS OF DEEP SOUTH TEXAS...
