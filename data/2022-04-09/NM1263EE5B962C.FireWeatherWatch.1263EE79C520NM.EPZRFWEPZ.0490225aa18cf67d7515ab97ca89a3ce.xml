<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued April 09 at 10:19PM MDT until April 11 at 8:00PM MDT by NWS El Paso</headline>
<description>...AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS LASTING
THROUGH TUESDAY DUE TO STRONG WINDS, VERY LOW HUMIDITY, WARMER
THAN NORMAL TEMPERATURES, AND DEEP INSTABILITY...
For Sunday we will see wide-spread windy conditions with very low
min RH`s, and therefore a Red Flag Warning is in effect for both
the mountains and the lowlands on Sunday afternoon. Our winds and
dry conditions will continue on Monday so a Fire Weather Watch
has been issued for Monday. An approaching upper level storm
system will give us even stronger winds on Tuesday, though a
slight uptick in moisture may keep western areas out of Red Flag
conditions. Areas to the east will likely reach Red Flag
criteria.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON TO 8 PM MDT
SUNDAY FOR FOR STRONG WINDS AND LOW HUMIDITY FOR FIRE WEATHER
ZONES 055, 056, 110, 111, 112, AND 113...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH MONDAY EVENING FOR FOR STRONG WINDS AND LOW HUMIDITY FOR
FIRE WEATHER ZONES 055, 056, 110, 111, 112, AND 113...
* 20 FOOT WINDS...West to southwest winds will increase to 20 to
30 mph by early afternoon with gusts to 45-50 mph after mid
afternoon.
* HUMIDITY...An extended duration of very low relative humidity
is expected. Lowlands will see minimum relative humidity in
the 5-10 percent range, while area mountain see minimums in
the 8- 15 percent range. Overnight recoveries will be poor
with maximum relative humidity only in the 25-40 percent
range.
* IMPACTS...any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly.
Outdoor burning is not recommended. Be careful with anything
that might cause sparks.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now, or will shortly. A combination of
strong winds, low relative humidity, and warm temperatures can
contribute to extreme fire behavior.
A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are forecast to occur. Listen for later forecasts and possible
Red Flag Warnings.</instruction>
