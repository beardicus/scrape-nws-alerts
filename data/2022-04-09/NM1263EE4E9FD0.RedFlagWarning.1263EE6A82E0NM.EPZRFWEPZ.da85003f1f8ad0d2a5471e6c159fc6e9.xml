<headline>Red Flag Warning issued April 09 at 1:24PM MDT until April 10 at 8:00PM MDT by NWS El Paso</headline>
<description>...AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS FOR
TODAY THROUGH AT LEAST MONDAY DUE TO STRONG WINDS, VERY LOW
HUMIDITY, WARMER THAN NORMAL TEMPERATURES, AND DEEP INSTABILITY...
.After a couple of relatively calm days, winds will be on the
increase this afternoon. We will see sustained winds of 20 to
30 mph in area mountains and that combined with low min RH`s near
10%, has prompted a Red Flag warning to be issued for this
afternoon. Most lowland locations will see near Red Flag
conditions as well. For Sunday we will see more wide spread windy
conditions with very low min RH`s, so a Red Flag warning is in
effect for both the mountains and the lowlands on Sunday
afternoon. Our winds and dry conditions will continue on Monday
so a Fire Weather watch has been issued for Monday as well. An
approaching upper level storm system will give us even stronger
winds on Tuesday.

30 mph by early afternoon with gusts of 35 to 45 mph after mid
afternoon.

is expected. Lowlands will see minimum relative humidity in
the 5-10 percent range, while area mountain see minimums in
the 8- 15 percent range. Overnight recoveries will be poor

range.

<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now, or will shortly. A combination of
strong winds, low relative humidity, and warm temperatures can
contribute to extreme fire behavior.
A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are forecast to occur. Listen for later forecasts and possible
Red Flag Warnings.</instruction>
