<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued April 09 at 6:21AM CDT until April 11 at 9:00PM CDT by NWS El Paso</headline>
<description>...AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS FOR
TODAY THROUGH AT LEAST MONDAY DUE TO STRONG WINDS, VERY LOW
HUMIDITY, WARMER THAN NORMAL TEMPERATURES, AND DEEP INSTABILITY...
.After a couple of relatively calm days, winds will be on the
increase this afternoon. We will see sustained winds of 20 to 30
mph in area mountains and that combined with low min RH`s near
10%, has prompted a Red Flag warning to be issued for this
afternoon. Most lowland locations will see near Red Flag
conditions as well. For Sunday we will see more wide spread windy
conditions with very low min RH`s, so a Red Flag warning is in
effect for both the mountains and the lowlands on Sunday
afternoon. Our winds and dry conditions will continue on Monday
so a Fire Weather watch has been issued for Monday as well. An
approaching upper level storm system will give us even stronger
winds on Tuesday.
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM NOON TO 8 PM MDT SUNDAY FOR
STRONG WINDS AND LOW HUMIDITY FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONES 055, 056,
111, AND 112...

The National Weather Service in El Paso Tx/Santa Teresa has
issued a Red Flag Warning, which is in effect from noon to 8 PM
MDT Sunday and a Fire Weather Watch has also been issued. This

30 mph by early afternoon with gusts of 35 to 45 mph after mid
afternoon.

is expected. Lowlands will see minimum relative humidity in
the 5-10 percent range, while area mountain see minimums in

range.

that might cause sparks.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now, or will shortly. A combination of
strong winds, low relative humidity, and warm temperatures can
contribute to extreme fire behavior.
A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are forecast to occur. Listen for later forecasts and possible
Red Flag Warnings.</instruction>
