<description>...Wintry Weather Today and Cold Temperatures Tonight...
A strong and unseasonably cold storm system will continue to
affect the region this weekend. Scattered rain and snow showers
are expected this morning into the early afternoon. Little to no
snow accumulation is expected in most places. However, at 2500
feet elevation and above a dusting to an inch of snow is possible
through this afternoon. From this morning through late this
afternoon, the crest of Pine Mountain along the Little Shepherd
Trail and Black Mountain could receive between 1 and 2 inches of
snow. Slippery travel could occur at times on KY 160 between Lynch
and the VA border.
Precipitation ends late this afternoon into early this evening,
with clearing skies expected late tonight and overnight. This
will set up for temperatures near or below freezing by dawn on
Sunday. Most places can expect frost at a minimum, and the
possibility of temperatures dipping below 30 degrees, especially
in the sheltered valleys.</description>
