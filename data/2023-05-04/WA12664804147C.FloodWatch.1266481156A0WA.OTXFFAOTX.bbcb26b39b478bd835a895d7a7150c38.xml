<headline>Flood Watch issued May 04 at 12:11PM PDT  by NWS Spokane</headline>
<description>.A long period of heavy rain will take place through early this
weekend. Convective thunderstorms with heavy rain will transition to
widespread rainfall causing already fast moving rivers and creeks to
continue to rise. Additional rainfall on areas that are flood-prone
may cause creeks and streams to rise out of their banks.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH FRIDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Idaho, including the following counties,
Benewah, Latah, Lewis, Nez Perce and Shoshone. Portions of
Southeast Washington, including the following counties, Asotin,
Garfield and Whitman.
* WHEN...Through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...Area rivers, creeks, and small streams are on the rise
due to melting snow from the unseasonably warm weather and heavy
rain on snowmelt will exasperate runoff. Heavy rain may also cause
flooding of urban areas and flash flooding or debris flows,
especially in steep terrain and near burn scars.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Wet slow moving thunderstorms will develop across the
southern to central Idaho Panhandle this afternoon and track
into southeast Washington during the evening hours.
Thunderstorms will be capable of producing torrential
downpours that could lead to flash flooding. Additional rain
with showers will continue through Friday with rivers, small
streams, and creeks remaining high.
