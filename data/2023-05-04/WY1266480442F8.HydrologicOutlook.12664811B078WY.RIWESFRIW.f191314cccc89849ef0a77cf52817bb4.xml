<description>...Increased River Flows and Flooding due to Snowmelt...
A weather system moving into the area today into Friday will cool
temperatures and bring scattered rain showers to Lincoln County. The
light rain is not expected to be a major contributor to flooding at
this time. Despite the cooling temperatures, rivers and streams are
expected to continue running high as warm temperatures have melted
much of the valley and foothills snowpack, which is making its way
into the main stem rivers.
Local emergency management reports widespread low-land flooding near
the Bear River and Salt River, with smaller tributary streams
running high as well. Currently, flooding is mainly affecting
low-lying agricultural areas. Streams are generally expected to rise
further into the day Friday, after which time flows are expected to
level off, but remain high through the weekend.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding. In hilly terrain, there are hundreds of low
water crossings which can be affected by increased stream flows. Do
not attempt to cross flooded roads. Please report observed flooding
to local emergency services or law enforcement.</description>
