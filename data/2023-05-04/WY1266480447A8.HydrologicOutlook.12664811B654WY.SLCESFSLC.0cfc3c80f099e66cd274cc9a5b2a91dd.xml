<description>... CREEKS, STREAMS, AND RIVERS TO CONTINUE RUNNING HIGH, FAST
AND COLD DUE TO SNOWMELT...
Streams, creeks, and rivers will continue to experience elevated
flows for the next several weeks, especially mid elevation
watersheds across the forecast area. Waterways will be extremely
dangerous, running high, fast, and cold, increasing the risk of
hypothermia and drowning with even brief periods of time in the
water. Keep a safe distance from these waterways as banks may
become unstable, and especially monitor children and pets closely
as they can quickly drown in these elevated flows.
Isolated flooding has occurred, and will continue to occur. Many
other mid-elevation watersheds will continue to run high, fast,
and cold with flows approaching, or remaining near, bankfull
conditions.
Given record snowpack in our area mountains, any sustained
periods of above average temperatures through the spring will have
the potential to unlock additional water contained in high
elevation snowpack, leading to additional rises on area waterways.
Continue to monitor conditions closely as the spring snowmelt-
runoff has now begun in earnest. Stay tuned for the latest river
forecasts, watches, and warnings. Refer to those already issued
for additional information.</description>
