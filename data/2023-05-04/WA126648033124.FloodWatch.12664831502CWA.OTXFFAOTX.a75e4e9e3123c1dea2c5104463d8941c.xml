<headline>Flood Watch issued May 04 at 6:29AM PDT until May 07 at 8:55AM PDT by NWS Spokane</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 5 PM PDT THIS AFTERNOON
THROUGH FRIDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by rain and snowmelt is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of North Central Washington, including the
following counties, Chelan and Okanogan.
* WHEN...From 5 PM PDT this afternoon through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...Area rivers, creeks, and small streams are on the rise
due to melting snow from the unseasonably warm weather and heavy
rain on snowmelt will exasperate runoff. Flash flooding and debris
flows will be possible with steep terrain and locations near burn
scars especially susceptible to flash flooding impacts.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Wet slow moving thunderstorms will track across north-central
Washington this evening with heavy rain at times continuing
through the day Friday.
