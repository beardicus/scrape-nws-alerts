<description>...Snowmelt and additional rainfall to continue rises on many rivers
and creeks in the region...
River rises and increased flows will continue through the week as a
result of snowmelt and rainfall through Saturday. Any thunderstorms
that develop through Friday evening will be capable of producing
heavy rain which may further accentuate the rising rivers. Isolated
heavier showers or thunderstorms may also produce localized debris
flows in steep terrain, especially near burn scars. Urban areas as
well as locations with poor drainage will also be susceptible to
flooding.
Several rivers are forecast to reach bankfull by late Friday or this
weekend. This includes the Moyie and Kootenai Rivers.</description>
