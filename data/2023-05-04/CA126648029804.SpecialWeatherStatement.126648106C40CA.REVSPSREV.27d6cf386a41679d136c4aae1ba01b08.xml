<description>...Additional Showers and Thunderstorms Today into the Weekend...
* Scattered rain/snow/pellet showers will once again develop
today, with a 15-30% chance for a thunderstorm at any given
location. Rain-snow lines will hover near 6000-7000 feet today,
falling overnight, where heavier showers could bring snow as low
as 4500-5500 feet at times.
* Tonight and into Friday, there is a strong signal for the
heavier showers to focus across north central Nevada, especially
for Pershing County north of Lovelock. Elsewhere, shower
activity will be more isolated in nature.
* Yet another round of rain and snow showers arrives Saturday with
the main focus in the Sierra and northeast California.
* Roadway snow accumulation tends to be difficult this late into
the season, but is still possible in heavier bands of snow and
during the overnight hours. If you have travel plans through
the Sierra, check with CalTrans and/or NDOT for the latest on
road conditions.
* Breezy southwest to west afternoon winds are expected each day
today through the weekend. The greater concern is stronger winds
from any thunderstorms that may develop, particularly across the
west-central Nevada Basin and Range today.
* High temperatures will remain 5-15 degrees below normal through
the weekend, but at this point low temperatures in lower
elevation valleys should remain above freezing. The one time
frame to potentially watch is Saturday night into Sunday morning
when typically colder valleys could fall near the freezing mark,
with a 10% chance of dipping below freezing. Hard freezes are
anticipated for all mountain valleys.</description>
