<headline>Flood Watch issued May 04 at 12:11PM PDT until May 07 at 4:53AM PDT by NWS Spokane</headline>
<description>.A long period of heavy rain will take place through early this
weekend. Convective thunderstorms with heavy rain will transition to
widespread rainfall causing already fast moving rivers and creeks to
continue to rise. Additional rainfall on areas that are flood-prone
may cause creeks and streams to rise out of their banks.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 5 PM PDT THIS AFTERNOON
THROUGH FRIDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by rain and snowmelt continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of North Central Washington, including the
following counties, Chelan and Okanogan.
* WHEN...From 5 PM PDT this afternoon through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...Area rivers, creeks, and small streams are on the rise
due to melting snow from the unseasonably warm weather and heavy
rain on snowmelt will exasperate runoff. Flash flooding and debris
flows will be possible with steep terrain and locations near burn
scars especially susceptible to flash flooding impacts.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Wet slow moving thunderstorms will track across north-central
Washington this evening with heavy rain at times continuing
through the day Friday.
