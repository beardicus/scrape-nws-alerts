<description>...AN INTENSE LAKE EFFECT SNOW BAND WILL CONTINUE TO AFFECT PARTS OF
NIAGARA AND NORTHERN ERIE COUNTIES THIS MORNING...
HAZARDS...A lake effect snow band which can rapidly reduce visibility
to less than a quarter of a mile. This lake effect snow band is
producing extremely heavy snow at the rate of 2 to 3 inches per hour.
LOCATION AND MOVEMENT...At 857 AM EST, a lake effect snow band was
located across most of Niagara County, Grand Island and far northern
Erie county. This band will remain nearly stationary through the
rest of this morning, before starting to drift to the north this
afternoon.
LOCATIONS IMPACTED INCLUDE...
Buffalo, Cheektowaga, Niagara Falls, North Tonawanda, Lockport,
Kenmore, Tonawanda, Amherst, Williamsville, Grand Island, Newfane,
Pendleton, Erie Basin Marina, Lewiston, Middleport, Sanborn, Barker,
Clarence Center, Cambria Center and Pendleton Center.
Travel will be extremely difficult, if not nearly impossible in the
most intense portion of this band, including Niagara Falls and
Lockport.
This includes Interstate 90 between exits 49 and 51.
SAFETY INFO...
Use extra caution if you must travel into or through this lake effect
snow band. Rapid changes in visibility and potentially slick roads
may lead to accidents.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time to reach your destination.
