<headline>Flood Watch issued February 23 at 10:02AM EST until February 25 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Buffalo</headline>
<description>.The combination of high flows leading into this event, recent
rainfall, and run-off from snow melt may cause a few rivers and
creeks to exceed bankfull.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of western New York, including the following
counties, Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Genesee, Livingston,
Monroe, Niagara, Northern Erie, Orleans, Southern Erie and Wyoming.
* WHEN...Until 7 PM EST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Flows are already high on many area creeks and rivers,
and the combination of snow melt from Tuesdays warm weather and
rainfall will cause water levels to rise again. This will bring
the risk of flooding along some rivers and creeks due to high
flows.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A half to one inch of rain that fell over the region on
Tuesday, combined with snow melt from 50 degree temperatures,
has led to significant runoff into area tributaries. This
will result in rises on larger creeks and rivers, and
potentially will cause flooding at some flood prone areas.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
