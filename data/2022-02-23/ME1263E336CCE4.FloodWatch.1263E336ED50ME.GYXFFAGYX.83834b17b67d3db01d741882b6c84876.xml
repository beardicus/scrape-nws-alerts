<headline>Flood Watch issued February 23 at 3:17AM EST  by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>.An ice jam may cause water to infiltrate the lowlands along the
river.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and/or snowmelt and/or ice jam
continues to be possible.
* WHERE...Portions of western Maine, including the following areas,
Northern Oxford and Southern Oxford. Portions of New Hampshire,
including the following areas, Northern Carroll, Northern Coos,
Northern Grafton, Southern Carroll, Southern Coos, Southern
Grafton and Sullivan.
* WHEN...Through Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations due
to ice jams.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rainfall will combine with rapid snowmelt today to cause
rises on area rivers. In addition, pre-existing ice jams will
be focus areas for flooding as river rises cause flooding of
low-lying areas.  Rivers will continue to rise through the
day, before peaking later tonight. The additional rises along
with weakening river ice could lead to additional ice break-
up and possible ice jam flooding.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
