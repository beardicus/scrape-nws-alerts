<headline>Flood Watch issued February 23 at 11:16AM EST until February 26 at 1:00AM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>.An ice jam may cause water to infiltrate the lowlands along the
river.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and/or snowmelt and/or ice jam
continues to be possible.
* WHERE...Portions of western Maine, including the following areas,
Northern Oxford and Southern Oxford. Portions of New Hampshire,
including the following areas, Northern Carroll, Northern Coos,
Northern Grafton, Southern Carroll, Southern Coos, Southern
Grafton and Sullivan.
* WHEN...Through Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rapid snowmelt today will cause rises on area rivers. In
addition, pre-existing ice jams will be focus areas for
flooding as river rises cause flooding of low-lying areas.
River rises are expected to peak later tonight. The
additional rises along with weakening river ice could lead to
additional ice break-up and possible ice jam flooding.

Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
