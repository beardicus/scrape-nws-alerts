<description>...FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1115 AM EST THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain, snowmelt, and an ice jam is
occurring.
* WHERE...A portion of central New Hampshire, including the
following county, Sullivan. Sugar River in West Claremont.
* WHEN...Until 1115 AM EST.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring. Streams
continue to rise due to excess runoff from earlier rainfall and
continuing snowmelt. Depending on ice behavior, any release of the
ice jam could result in sudden rises of water, leading to a rapid
flooding situation.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 710 AM EST, An ice jam locked in place in West Claremont
is causing water to rise on the Sugar River. Increased runoff
due to rain and snowmelt will continue to allow for increased
rises on the river over the next 12 hours. Flooding is
already occurring in the warned area and is expected to
continue until the ice jam releases. Between 0.5 and 0.8
inches of rain have fallen. Additional snowmelt is expected
through today.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Claremont.

deaths occur in vehicles.
Water levels can rise and fall quickly in the vicinity of ice jams.

alert for rapidly fluctuating water levels in the vicinity of ice
jams. Forecast values represent ice-free flow.</instruction>
