<headline>Flood Watch issued February 23 at 10:02AM EST until February 25 at 10:00PM EST by NWS Buffalo</headline>
<description>.The combination of high flows leading into this event, recent
rainfall, and run-off from snow melt may cause a few rivers and
creeks to exceed bankfull.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of central New York, including the following
counties, Jefferson and Lewis.
* WHEN...Until 7 PM EST this evening.
* IMPACTS...A combination of Tuesdays rain and snow melt will cause
flows to increase on the Black River and it`s tributaries through
today. Flows are already high, and there are ice jams in place on
some waterways. This will bring the risk of flooding along the
Black River and its tributaries due to high flows or ice jams.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A half to and inch and a half of rain that fell over the
region late Tuesday and Tuesday night, combined with snow
melt from temperatures that climbed into the 50s, will likely
lead to significant runoff into area tributaries. This will
result in rises on creeks and streams, and potentially will
cause flooding at some flood prone areas.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
