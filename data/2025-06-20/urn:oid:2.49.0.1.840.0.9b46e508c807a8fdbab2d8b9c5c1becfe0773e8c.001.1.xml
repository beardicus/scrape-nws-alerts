        <headline>Flood Advisory issued June 20 at 5:33PM AKDT until June 22 at 10:00PM AKDT by NWS Anchorage AK</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...Flooding caused by snowmelt is expected.

* WHERE...the Yentna and Skwentna Rivers and other nearby
tributaries.

* WHEN...Until 1000 PM AKDT Sunday.

* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 532 PM AKDT, Warm temperatures are resulting in rapid
snowmelt at higher elevations of the Western Alaska Range.
This is leading to higher water levels across much of the
Susitna Valley, especially along the Yentna and Skwentna
Rivers. This will lead to minor flooding in low lying areas
along these rivers this weekend. River levels will be highest
during the late afternoon and evening hours in response to
peak melting at the warmest time of day. Increasing cloud
cover this weekend through early next week, will lead to
gradual cooling of temperatures. Thus, snowmelt will lessen
by late Sunday and allow water levels to begin to fall.
- For Skwentna River at Skwentna:
At 12:00pm the stage was 40.6 feet.
Flood Stage is 42.0 feet.
Forecast: A crest around 41.2 feet is expected around 10:00am
Saturday.

Impacts:
At 41.5 feet: Water starts to flow over low spots on the road
which is adjacent to an active slough.  There are five or so
houses on this road including the Wx observers.

- For Yentna River at Lake Creek:
At 4:00pm the stage was 20.4 feet.
Flood Stage is 20.5 feet.
Forecast: A crest around 20.6 feet is expected around 10:00am
Sunday.

Impacts:
At 20.5 feet: Anglers Inn &amp; King Point Lodges will have water
in several cabins.
