        <headline>Air Quality Alert issued June 20 at 5:10PM MDT by NWS Grand Junction CO</headline>
        <description>The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has
issued the following...

WHAT...Air Quality Health Advisory for Wildfire Smoke.

WHERE...Moffat County. Locations include, but are not limited to
mainly rural portions of Moffat County along Highway 13, southwest
of Hamilton.

WHEN...500 PM Friday June 20 to 900 AM Saturday June 21

IMPACTS...A wind driven fire is producing areas of smoke in
southwestern Moffat County. Smoke is moving to the northeast along
Highway 13. Smoke may be present in this area during the overnight
and early morning hours, particularly in low lying terrain.

HEALTH INFORMATION...Public Health Recommendations: If smoke is
thick or becomes thick in your neighborhood you may want to remain
indoors. This is especially true for those with heart disease,
respiratory illnesses, the very young, and older adults. Consider
limiting outdoor activity when moderate to heavy smoke is present.
Consider relocating temporarily if smoke is present indoors and is
making you ill. If visibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in
your neighborhood, smoke has reached levels that are unhealthy.
