<description>...Heavy rainfall and flooding possible by late week...
A strong storm system moving into the region by late week will is
expected to bring a combination of rain and snow along its track.
Heavy rainfall totals may occur in areas that receive mostly liquid
precipitation, and this rainfall may lead to flooding of rivers and
poor drainage areas. This flood potential exists from Friday through
the weekend depending on the track of the system.
Due to recent wet weather, soils across the area have a high
moisture content. Rivers also remain elevated. These antecedent
conditions reduce the amount of rainfall necessary to cause
flooding. At the present time, the most likely overlap between heavy
liquid precipitation and favorable antecedent conditions is roughly
near and south of I-80. River forecast guidance based upon a range
of rainfall possibilities indicates a wide range of river levels by
the weekend, including rivers remaining relatively steady near
bankfull and some rivers rising to above moderate flood stage.
This outlook means that elevated water levels and potential impacts
are possible, but not yet certain. Persons should closely monitor
forecasts including the possibility of flood watches, warnings, and
advisories.
This outlook will be updated by tomorrow morning.</description>
