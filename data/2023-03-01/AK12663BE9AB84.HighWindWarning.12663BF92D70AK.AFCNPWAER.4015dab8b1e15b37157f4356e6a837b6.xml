<headline>High Wind Warning issued March 01 at 4:37AM AKST until March 02 at 6:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM AKST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...West winds 35 to 55 mph with gusts up to 80 mph
expected.
* WHERE...Kodiak Island.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM AKST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...High winds may move loose debris, damage property,
and cause power outages. Travel will be difficult, especially
for high profile vehicles.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Strong winds will develop across the entire
island this morning in the wake of a deepening area of low
pressure tracking just east of Kodiak Island northeast toward
the Kenai Peninsula. Winds will then diminish late Wednesday
morning before increasing again Wednesday afternoon. There is
higher confidence in the second peak gusting to 75 mph or
greater, and it is likely to be stronger than the first peak.
The combination of any lingering snow showers or snow on the
ground with the strong winds may cause blowing and drifting
snow. Visibility reductions to one half mile are possible
should this occur.</description>
<instruction>People are urged to secure loose objects that could be blown
around or damaged by the wind. Prepare for the possibility of
widespread power outages. Use caution if you must drive.</instruction>
