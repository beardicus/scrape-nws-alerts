<headline>Blizzard Warning issued March 01 at 9:26AM AKST until March 01 at 3:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 PM AKST THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions. Additional snow accumulations of up
to two inches. North winds gusting to 45 mph around Seward
Wednesday morning. Reduced visibility as low as one quarter
mile.
* WHERE...Whittier and Seward.
* WHEN...Until 3 PM AKST this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...As an area of low pressure passes east of
Seward early this morning, northerly winds will quickly
increase, peaking mid-morning before slowly diminishing late
this afternoon. Snow will likely be fluffy, and windy conditions
will significantly reduce visibility and create snow drifts.
Gusty westerly winds will also develop for Portage Valley and
Whittier this afternoon and persist through Thursday allowing
to another round of blowing snow. The blowing snow will likely
cause reduced visibilities to persist for these locations
through Thursday.</description>
<instruction>A Blizzard Warning means severe winter weather conditions are
expected or occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds
and poor visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout
conditions, making travel very hazardous. If you must travel,
have a winter survival kit with you.If you get stranded, stay
with your vehicle.
For the latest road conditions call 5 1 1 or visit
511.alaska.gov.</instruction>
