<headline>Flood Advisory issued July 09 at 3:54PM EDT  by NWS Caribou</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 645 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Small stream flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
expected.
* WHERE...A portion of WEST CENTRAL Maine, including the following
county, Somerset.
* WHEN...Until 645 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Water over dirt roadways. Some low-water crossings may
become impassable.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 353 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
nearly stationary thunderstorms. This will cause small stream
and creek flooding. Between 0.5 and 1.5 inches of rain have
fallen.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are expected
over the area. This additional rain will result in minor
flooding and washout of North Woods dirt roads.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Billy-Jack Depot and Baker Lake.
- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
