to 2 inches are likely across the watch area, with localized
higher amounts in locations that receive multiple rounds of
thunderstorms. The flooding threat will be exacerbated in
locations that have received heavy rain over the past few
days. This heavy rainfall may lead to rapid water rises in
creeks and streams, in addition to urban and other flood-
prone locations.
