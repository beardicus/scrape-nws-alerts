expected to persist through Tuesday.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action
should Flash Flood Warnings be issued. In addition, if you live,
travel, or work in a flood prone area, make sure you have multiple
ways to receive warnings. Have a contingency or escape plan in place
in case of flooding. Finally, never drive on flooded roads. Turn
around, don`t drown.</instruction>
