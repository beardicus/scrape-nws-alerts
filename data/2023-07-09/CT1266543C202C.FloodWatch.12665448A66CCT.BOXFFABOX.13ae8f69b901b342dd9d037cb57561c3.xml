* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be

* WHERE...Portions of northern Connecticut, including the following

out of their banks.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Several rounds of showers and thunderstorms are expect
tonight into Monday night. Storm total rainfall of 2 to 4
inches is expected across the watch area, but localized
amounts in excess of 5 inches are possible especially where
thunderstorms develop and move over the same areas.
Thunderstorms will have the potential to produce rainfall
rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour, which will elevate the risk
of urban and street flooding along with localized flash
flooding. The greatest risk for storms will be across
northern Connecticut, western and central Massachusetts.
