<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THIS EVENING THROUGH TUESDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Including the following area, Central Beaufort Sea Coast.
This includes the cities of Nuiqsut, Prudhoe Bay, Alpine,
Deadhorse, And Kuparuk.
* WHEN...From this evening through Tuesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
streams, and creeks which exit to the Arctic Coast including the
Sagavanirktok River and Kuparuk River.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Large rises have been measured along the Sagavanirktok River
upstream near the headwaters, which reached near moderate
flood stage. Given the heavy rainfall across the headwaters,
all rivers draining to the Arctic Coast will see large rises
as the crest moves downstream. Creeks, rivers, and streams
may rise out of their banks. Low-water crossings may be
flooded.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
