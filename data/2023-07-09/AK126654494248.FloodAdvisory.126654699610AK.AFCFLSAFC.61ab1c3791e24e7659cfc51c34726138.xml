expected.
* WHERE...Kennicott River near McCarthy.
* WHEN...Until 900 AM AKDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 908 PM AKDT, Hidden Lake, which is dammed by the Kennicott
Glacier, has begun to
release and will cause a significant rise on the Kennicott
River at
McCarthy. The Kennicott River water levels prior to the
release
were at 1343 feet on the river gage.
Expect water levels on the Kennicott River to rise an
additional
3 to 7 feet over the next 24 to 48 hours.
This is a yearly event that occurs in mid to late summer.
Persons living or traveling in the vicinity of the Kennicott
River are
urged to prepare for rapidly rising water and possible minor
flooding
and bank erosion during the next several days. Persons
traveling for
recreation should avoid parking or camping in low lying areas
near
the Kennicott River.
The Chitina and Copper Rivers will experience moderate rises
in water
levels as the glacier dammed outburst progresses downstream.
- For Kennicott River near McCarthy:
At 8:15pm the stage was 1345.73 feet.
Flood Stage is 1350.0 feet.
Impacts:
At 1347.0 feet: Bankfull stage.
At 1350.0 feet: Minor flood stage. Water begins to impact the
campground upstream of the bridge.
Inherent uncertainty in initial glacier lake volume will
result in varying crest height and timing.
