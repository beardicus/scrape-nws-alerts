MORNING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of northern Connecticut, including the following
areas, Hartford CT, Tolland CT and Windham CT. Portions of
Massachusetts, including the following areas, Eastern Franklin MA,
Eastern Hampden MA, Eastern Hampshire MA, Northern Middlesex MA,
Northern Worcester MA, Southern Worcester MA, Western Franklin MA,
Western Hampden MA and Western Hampshire MA.
* WHEN...From this evening through Tuesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Several rounds of showers and thunderstorms are expected
later today into Monday evening. Storm total rainfall
rainfall of 2 to 3 inches is expected across the watch area,
but localized higher amounts up to 5 inches are possible
especially where thunderstorms develop and move over the same
areas. Thunderstorms will have the potential to produce
rainfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour, which will elevate
the risk of urban and street flooding along with localized
flash flooding. The greatest risk for storms will be across
northern Connecticut, western and central Massachusetts.
