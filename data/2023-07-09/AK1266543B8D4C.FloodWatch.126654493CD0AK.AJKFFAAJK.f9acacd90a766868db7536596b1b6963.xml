<headline>Flood Watch issued July 09 at 7:31AM AKDT until July 09 at 9:00PM AKDT by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR SNOWMELT NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by snowmelt continues to be possible.
* WHERE...The following area, Chilkat River.
* WHEN...Through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Backyards along the Chilkat River in the village of
Klukwan may start to flood and impact some smoke houses.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Unusually warm daytime temperatures into the 70s and 80s
through the Sunday may accelerate snow and glacier ice melt
in the Chilkat River basin. River levels are expected to
remain near bankfull and that may start to cause issues for
areas around Klukwan Sunday morning and afternoon. Highest
water levels are expected Sunday morning. There is
uncertainty on how high the river will get with the
possibilities ranging from the bankfull conditions to minor
flooding in some areas.
- If you live near or along Chilkat River stay alert and be
prepared to take action.</description>
