<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood

Stay tuned to further developments by listening to your local radio,
television, or NOAA Weather Radio for further information.
Caution is urged when walking near riverbanks.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. Most flood related deaths
occur in automobiles. Do not attempt to cross water covered bridges,
dips, or low water crossings. Never try to cross a flowing stream,
