<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM THIS EVENING TO 5 AM
AKST WEDNESDAY FOR INTERIOR BRISTOL BAY...
* WHAT...East winds 30 to 45 mph with gusts of 55 to 70 mph
expected.
* WHERE...Interior Bristol Bay, including Iliamna, Koliganek,
and New Stuyahok.
* WHEN...From 6 PM this evening to 5 AM AKST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...High winds may move loose debris, damage property, and
cause power outages. Travel will be difficult. Gusty winds may
cause blowing and drifting of snow.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Winds over interior Bristol Bay will peak
late this evening into the overnight hours. Although not quite
as strong, gusts of 50 to 60 mph are also expected along the
Alaska Peninsula south of King Salmon, including Port Heiden,

45 mph. Temperatures will remain above freezing across the
region, with precipitation falling as mostly rain. There will be
some snow at the start for inland areas, with low visibilities
as the high winds blow the falling snow.</description>
<instruction>People are urged to secure loose objects that could be blown
around or damaged by the wind. Prepare for the possibility of
widespread power outages. Use caution if you must drive.</instruction>
