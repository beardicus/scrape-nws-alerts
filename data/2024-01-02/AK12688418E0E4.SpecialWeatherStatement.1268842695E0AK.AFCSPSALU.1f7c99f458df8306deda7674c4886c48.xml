<description>...STRONG WINDS DEVELOPING WITH SNOW AND BLOWING SNOW CHANGING TO
RAIN THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH TONIGHT...
A strong low pressure system is poised to move along the Aleutian
Chain today before entering the southern Bering Sea tonight into
Wednesday. Easterly to east-northeasterly winds will pick up
this morning and peak with gusts to 55 mph in the afternoon to
early evening. Winds begin to weaken and turn more northeasterly
during the late evening and overnight hours. The front will reach
the Pribilof Islands this afternoon into the early evening hours.
Precipitation will begin from south to north as the winds are
peaking. There could be enough cold air in place initially that
St. Paul Island could experience a period of snow and blowing snow
late this afternoon into the evening hours before mixing with and
changing over to rain.</description>
