<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM WEDNESDAY
TO 10 AM PST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Moderate snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 3
to 6 inches likely, with isolated amounts up to 8 inches
possible across higher elevations. There is a 30 percent
chance of 1- 2 inch snow accumulations down to 4000 feet,
including I-5 at Tejon Pass. Snow levels will generally range
between 4500 and 5000 feet early Wednesday then could fall as
low as 4000 feet late Wednesday into Wednesday night, which
could impact I-5 at Tejon Pass. Northwest winds will be
increasing Wednesday afternoon into Wednesday night with gusts
in the 35 to 50 mph range.
* WHERE...The mountains of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, as
well as the Santa Barbara interior mountains.
* WHEN...From 3 AM Wednesday to 10 AM PST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult, with potential for
delays and closures. I-5 near Tejon Pass will potentially see
snow, ice, and gusty winds, which could cause significant
travel delays.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The gusty winds could bring reduced
visibilities in blowing snow, especially Wednesday afternoon
into Wednesday night. A second and potentially colder storm
system could impact the local mountains this weekend,
potentially bringing snow levels as low as 3000 feet.</description>
