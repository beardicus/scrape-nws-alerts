<description>...MISSOURI RIVER NEAR BISMARCK AND MANDAN ICING OVER...
As of early Thursday afternoon, sheets of ice are continuing to work
their way down through the Bismarck and Mandan reach of the Missouri
River. Thus far, the river has only risen a few inches, but at some
point between late Thursday and Friday evening, it is likely that
the ice will begin to accumulate near the University of Mary and
restrict flow in the river. As the river channel fills with immobile
ice, the river above the immobile ice will see rapid increases in
water levels.
Since 2010, the river has risen between five and nearly eight feet
during the first icing over event for the winter season, often in
well under 24 hours. As of Thursday afternoon, the water level for
the Missouri River at Bismarck is 4.2 feet. Given recent history,
this would suggest the river will be at a stage of between roughly 9
feet and 12 feet once the river ice is in place. Flood stage at the
Bismarck gage on the Missouri River is 14.5 feet.
If you observe problematic high water, please report this to your
local emergency management.</description>
