<headline>Rip Current Statement issued December 01 at 3:10PM ChST until December 06 at 6:00PM ChST by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH TUESDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...East facing reefs of the Marianas.
* WHEN...Through Tuesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Trade-wind swell will maintain surf up to
9 feet and a high risk of rip currents along east facing reefs
the next several days. By late week, northeasterly trade swell
will increase and will likely cause surf along north facing
reefs to also increase. This could result in a high risk of
rip currents along north reefs and hazardous surf along both
north and east facing reefs for the weekend.</description>
<instruction>Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
