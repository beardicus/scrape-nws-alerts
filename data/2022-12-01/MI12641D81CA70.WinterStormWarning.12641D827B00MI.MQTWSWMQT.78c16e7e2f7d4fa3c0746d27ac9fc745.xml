times to the east of Munising and to the north of Newberry.
Additional snow accumulations of up to 3 inches. Snow
accumulations south and west of Munising will be less than 1
inch. West to northwest winds gusting to as high as 50 mph
will create considerable blowing snow and brief whiteout

north of Newberry. Winds will gradually diminish overnight.
* WHERE...Alger and Luce Counties.
* WHEN...Until 7 AM EST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be difficult around Grand Marais,

north of Newberry. Otherwise, plan on slippery road
conditions. Patchy blowing snow could significantly reduce
visibility. The hazardous conditions could impact the Thursday
