<headline>Flood Watch issued December 08 at 7:41PM PST  by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH SUNDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of northwest Oregon including the Coast Range of
Northwest Oregon and North Oregon Coast.
* WHEN...From Saturday afternoon through Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A moderate to strong atmospheric river will bring another
period of steady rain that will be heavy at times, late
Saturday into Sunday. Soils are saturated and will allow much
of the rain to runoff, particularly during periods of intense
rainfall. The most likely scenario is for 1.5-2.5 inches of
rain to fall along the immediate coast and 3-4 inches of rain
to fall across the north Oregon Coast Range. However, there
is a 25% chance that 5-7 inches of rain will fall during an
18-24 hour period across the north Oregon Coast Range. The
latter scenario would lead to many rivers climbing to
similar, if not higher levels, than what was observed earlier
this week. Also of note is that high tide will be running 1-2
ft higher on Sunday than what it was earlier this week and
may exacerbate flooding for communities near the mouths of
coastal rivers.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.
Landslides and debris flows are possible during this flood event.
People, structures, and roads located below steep slopes, in
canyons, and near the mouths of canyons may be at serious risk from
rapidly moving landslides.</instruction>
