less at times. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph. Freezing spray
will accumulate into a light glaze.

could significantly reduce visibility. Large snow drifts will
form. Ice will make traveling surfaces slippery.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Strong north winds will cause snow squalls
with periods of very low visibility through Saturday. The winds
combined with temperatures in the teens will cause freezing
spray to accumulate into a light glaze through Saturday. Winds
are expected to decrease Saturday afternoon and blowing snow
and freezing spray will diminish then. Gale force north winds
are expected to return Sunday night and continue into Wednesday
which will bring a return to snow squalls and blowing snow with
low visibility and freezing spray.</description>
