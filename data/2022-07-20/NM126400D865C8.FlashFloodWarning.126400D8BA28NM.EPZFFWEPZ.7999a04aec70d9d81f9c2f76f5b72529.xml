anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may be washed away in
places. If you encounter flood waters...climb to safety.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood

In hilly terrain there are numerous of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
