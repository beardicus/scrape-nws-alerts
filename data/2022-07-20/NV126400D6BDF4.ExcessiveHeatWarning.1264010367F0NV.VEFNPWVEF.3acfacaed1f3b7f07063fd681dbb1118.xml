<instruction>Young children and pets should never be left unattended in
vehicles under any circumstances. Car interiors can reach lethal
temperatures in a matter of minutes. Limit outdoor activities, drink
plenty of water, avoid alcoholic and caffeinated beverages, wear
light-weight clothing, and, if possible, spend more time in air-
conditioned or well-ventilated places.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. Know
the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. To
reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent rest breaks
in shaded or air-conditioned environments. Anyone overcome by heat
should be moved to a cool and shaded location. Heat stroke is an
emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
