<headline>Flood Watch issued August 04 at 6:56AM CDT until August 04 at 9:00AM CDT by NWS Paducah</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CDT TODAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of southern Illinois, western Kentucky and
southeast Missouri, along and west of a line from Perryville
Missouri to Olmsted Illinois to Murray Kentucky.
* WHEN...Until Noon CDT today.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Low-water
crossings may be flooded. There are a couple small rivers forecast
to rise above flood stage overnight and additional rainfall may
further heighten their rise or cause other similar rises on area
rivers.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- More storm development is expected early this morning.
Training of multiple storms over the same area is becoming
likely near the Mississippi River and into the Purchase Area
of Kentucky. The resultant heavy rain will aggravate any
existing flooding and cause additional flooding concerns.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
