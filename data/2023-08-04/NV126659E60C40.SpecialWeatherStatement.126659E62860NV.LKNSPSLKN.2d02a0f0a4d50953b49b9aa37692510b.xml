<headline>Special Weather Statement issued August 04 at 2:28PM PDT  by NWS Elko</headline>
<description>...A strong thunderstorm will impact portions of northeastern
Humboldt and northwestern Elko Counties through 300 PM PDT...
At 227 PM PDT, Doppler radar was tracking a strong thunderstorm
capable of producing a landspout 20 miles northeast of Paradise
Valley, one cell moving northeast at 20 mph while the southern cell
is stationary.
HAZARD...Landspouts, winds in excess of 30 mph, and nickel size
hail.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Minor damage to outdoor objects is possible. Gusty winds
could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured
objects.
This storm will remain over mainly rural areas of northeastern
Humboldt and northwestern Elko Counties.
LANDSPOUT...POSSIBLE
MAX HAIL SIZE...0.88 IN
MAX WIND GUST...30 MPH</description>
<instruction>If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.
Conditions are favorable for the development of weak, brief funnel
clouds. This type of funnel cloud is harmless, but on rare occasions
they can briefly touch down, producing wind gusts over 50 mph. If a
funnel cloud is spotted move indoors and report your sighting to the
National Weather Service.
Torrential rainfall is also occurring with this storm and may lead to
localized flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flooded
roadways.</instruction>
