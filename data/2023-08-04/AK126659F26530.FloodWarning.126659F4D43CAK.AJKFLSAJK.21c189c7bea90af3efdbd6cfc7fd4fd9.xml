<headline>Flood Warning issued August 04 at 6:20PM AKDT  by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>.Mendenhall Lake gauge levels along with imagery from Suicide Basin
indicate that the basin has started its release of water into the
Mendenhall lake.
...FLOOD WARNING FOR A GLACIER-DAMMED LAKE OUTBURST REMAINS IN
EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM AKDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by a glacier-dammed lake outburst is
expected.
* WHERE...The Mendenhall Lake and River around the glacier visitor
center, the Mendenhall campground, Skaters Cabin Road, View Drive
and possibly below Back Loop bridge.
* WHEN...Until 1000 AM AKDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, other low-lying
areas and flood-prone locations near Mendenhall Lake and River is
imminent.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 6 PM AKDT, the USGS gauge reports showed rising levels on
Mendenhall Lake consistent with a release of water from
Suicide Basin. Water levels have been rising at a rate of
around two tenths of a foot per hour. The imagery of Suicide
Basin confirms the start of a release. Flooding is expected
to begin shortly, especially near the Mendenhall Lake and
River.
- For Mendenhall Lake :
At 6:15pm the stage was 7.35 feet.
Flood Stage is 9.0 feet.
Forecast: A crest around 10.75 feet is expected around
10:00pm Saturday which puts the lake above the moderate flood
stage of 10.0 feet.
Impacts:
At 7.7 feet: Nugget Falls trail begins to flood near the
beginning of the trail. Along the Mendenhall River some
sections will experience bank erosion resulting in dangerous
tree fall. These conditions could make floating the river
more hazardous with the higher water levels.
At 9.0 feet: Water covers Skaters Cabin Road between Skaters
Cabin and West Glacier Trailhead, also water will flow into
the Mendenhall Lake Campground.
At 9.4 feet: The yards along View Drive will start to flood
and cause minor flooding.
At 9.6 feet: There will be 7 inches of water over the Skaters
Cabin Road between Skaters Cabin and West Glacier Trailhead.
Campsite 7 will be flooded as well as water flowing over the
road between campsites 8 and 9 in the Mendenhall campground.
At 10.0 feet: Water levels will inundate Mendenhall
Campground with up to 3 feet of water covering low areas as
well as up to 1.5 feet of water covering Skaters Cabin Road.
Portions of West Glacier Trail will be impassable.
At 10.4 feet: Significant flooding along the Mendenhall Lake
area with more than 3 feet of water in places and the
Mendenhall campground will be evacuated. Some homes along
View Drive will have up to 3 ft of water in yards.
- Inherent uncertainty in initial glacier lake volume will
result in varying crest height and timing.</description>
