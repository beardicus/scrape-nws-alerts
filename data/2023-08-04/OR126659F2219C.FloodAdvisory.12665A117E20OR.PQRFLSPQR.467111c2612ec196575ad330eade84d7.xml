<instruction>In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded

Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where

killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
