<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM PST MONDAY
THROUGH MONDAY EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 AM TO 11 AM
PST MONDAY...
* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, breaking waves 10 to 12
feet expected. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal
flooding expected.
* WHERE...San Francisco County.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, from 1 AM PST Monday
through Monday evening. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 7
AM to 11 AM PST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only isolated
road closures expected. For the Beach Hazards Statement expect
dangerous water conditions including localized beach erosion.
Large waves can sweep across the beach without warning, pulling
people into the sea from rocks, jetties, and beaches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Tidal levels are running around 1 foot
higher than tidal predictions. High tide will peak about 9:26 am
PST Monday between 7.0 to 7.5 feet, resulting in minor coastal
flooding for low-lying, flood-prone spots adjacent to the San
Francisco Bay. For the Beach Hazards Statement mainly northwest
facing beaches are most at risk for large, turbulent shore break
and strong currents. Northwest waves will gradually subside
later in the day on Christmas.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Remain out of the water to avoid hazardous swimming conditions.</instruction>
