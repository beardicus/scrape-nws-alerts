<headline>High Surf Advisory issued December 24 at 8:00PM EST until December 25 at 10:00PM EST by NWS Mobile</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 AM CST
MONDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM CST THIS
EVENING...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH TUESDAY
AFTERNOON...
...HIGH SURF WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM CST MONDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM TO 9 PM CST
MONDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
For the first High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 4 to
7 feet expected in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood
Advisory, minor coastal flooding expected. For the High Surf
Warning, dangerously large breaking waves of 6 to 10 feet
expected in the surf zone. For the second High Surf Advisory,
large breaking waves of 4 to 7 feet expected in the surf zone.
* WHERE...In Alabama, Mobile Coastal and Baldwin Coastal
Counties. In Florida, Escambia Coastal, Santa Rosa Coastal and
Okaloosa Coastal Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Tuesday
afternoon. For the first High Surf Advisory, until 9 PM CST
this evening. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 3 PM this
afternoon to 3 AM CST Monday. For the High Surf Warning, from
9 PM this evening to 9 AM CST Monday. For the second High Surf
Advisory, from 9 AM to 9 PM CST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Breaking waves can sweep
people off jetties and docks, and into dangerous seas. Life-
threatening swimming conditions and significant beach erosion
can be expected. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers
away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Significant wave runup and over-wash may
occur along Gulf Front beaches, particularly in the Gulf
Islands National Seashore area between Fort Pickens and
Pensacola Beach. Wave runup and over-wash through the dune
system can result in some minor flooding impacts on Fort
Pickens Road, although the road usually remains open and
passable.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of unknown
depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other waterside
infrastructure.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
