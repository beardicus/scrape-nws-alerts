<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued December 24 at 6:26PM CST until December 27 at 6:00AM CST by NWS Goodland</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH LATE TUESDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions possible. Total snow accumulations
ranging anywhere from 2 to 6 inches. Northwest winds may gust
up to 55 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of eastern Colorado, northwest Kansas and
southwest Nebraska, mainly along and north of Interstate 70.
* WHEN...Monday afternoon through Tuesday night.
* IMPACTS...A prolonged period of dangerous travel conditions
associated with accumulating snow, strong northwesterly winds
and blowing snow.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow will overspread the watch area from
the east Christmas afternoon and evening as a deepening low
pressure system in Iowa shifts westward into eastern Nebraska.
Periods of snow are possible throughout the day on Tuesday and
into Tuesday night, as the aforementioned low pressure system
meanders southward into eastern Kansas. Areas located along
and north of Highway 36 in Kansas and Nebraska are more prone
to experience significant snow accumulation and blizzard
conditions. The near-stationary nature of this system will
result in a prolonged period of breezy to strong northwest
winds over most, or all, of the Tri-State area on Christmas
Day and Tuesday.</description>
<instruction>Blizzard conditions are possible across the watch area late
Christmas day into Tuesday. Strongly consider alternate travel
plans. If you absolutely must travel, keep an extra flashlight,
food, and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency. The
latest road conditions for the state you are calling from can be
obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
