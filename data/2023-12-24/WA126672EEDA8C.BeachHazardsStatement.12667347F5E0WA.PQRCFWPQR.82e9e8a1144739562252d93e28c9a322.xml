* IMPACTS...Minor flooding (up to 1 foot above ground level) and
erosion is possible during high tide in the low lying areas near
bays, sloughs, highway 101, and the lower reaches of the coastal
waters. Destructive waves may wash over beaches, jetties, and
other structures unexpectedly. People can be swept off rocks and
jetties and drown while observing high surf. Minor beach erosion
may damage coastal properties and buildings. Higher than normal
water run-up is expected on beaches and low-lying shoreline.</description>
<instruction>A Coastal Flood Advisory means that tidal overflow flooding is
expected. Coastal residents in the warned area should be alert
for rising water, and take appropriate action to protect life and
property.
A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches,
producing rip currents, sneaker waves and beach erosion. Stay
well back from the water`s edge and be alert for exceptionally
high waves.
Keep away from large logs on the beach. Water running up on the
beach can easily lift or roll logs which can injure or kill
someone caught in their path.
Remain out of the water to avoid hazardous swimming conditions.</instruction>
