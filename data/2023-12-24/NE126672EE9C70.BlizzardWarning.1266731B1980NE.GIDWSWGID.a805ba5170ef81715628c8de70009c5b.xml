<headline>Blizzard Warning issued December 24 at 2:44PM CST until December 27 at 6:00AM CST by NWS Hastings</headline>
<description>...SIGNIFICANT WINTER STORM CHRISTMAS THROUGH EARLY WEDNESDAY...
...BLIZZARD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT TONIGHT TO 6 AM CST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions expected. Total snow accumulations
mainly between 4 and 8 inches. Northwest winds gusting as high as
around 35 MPH on Monday, but decreasing to 15 to 25 MPH Tuesday
into Wednesday.
* WHERE...Polk, York, and Hamilton Counties.
* WHEN...From midnight tonight to 6 AM CST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Visibilities may drop below 1/4 mile due to falling and
blowing snow. Travel could be very difficult. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact Christmas and post-Christmas travel.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Even with this storm so close in time, there
is still some uncertainty in the snowfall forecast, and further
upward or downward adjustments are quite possible. Even if snow
amounts end up being closer to the lower end range of
possibilities, strong winds will still cause travel issues due to
blowing and drifting snow.</description>
<instruction>Travel should be restricted to emergencies only. If you must travel,
have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded, stay with
your vehicle. The latest road conditions for the state you are
calling from can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.
Persons should delay all travel if possible. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution and be prepared for sudden
changes in visibility. Leave plenty of room between you and the
motorist ahead of you, and allow extra time to reach your
destination. Avoid sudden braking or acceleration, and be especially
cautious on hills or when making turns. Make sure your car is
winterized and in good working order.</instruction>
