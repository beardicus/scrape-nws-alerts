blizzard conditions are possible greatly impacting travel much of
the day on Tuesday.  Travelers planning to travel east on I-76 late
Monday through Tuesday should closely monitor the forecast.

TUESDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions possible. Total snow accumulations
between 1 and 4 inches possible. Winds could gust as high as 55
mph.
* WHERE...Julesburg, and Holyoke.
* WHEN...From Monday afternoon through late Tuesday night.
* IMPACTS...Visibilities may drop below 1/4 mile due to falling and
blowing snow. Plan on slippery road conditions and very difficult
travel conditions.</description>
<instruction>Prepare for possible blizzard conditions. Continue to monitor the
latest forecasts for updates on this situation.
Persons should consider delaying travel on Tuesday. Motorists should
use extreme caution if travel is absolutely necessary.</instruction>
