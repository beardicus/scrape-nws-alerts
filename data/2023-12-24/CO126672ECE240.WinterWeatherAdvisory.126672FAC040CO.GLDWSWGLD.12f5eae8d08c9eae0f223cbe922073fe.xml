CST/ THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Snow and blowing snow. Total snow accumulations ranging
anywhere from half an inch to five inches. North to northwest
winds sustained at 25 to 35 mph with gusts up to 50 mph

morning.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Bands of precipitation, initially in the

AM MST as breezy to strong north winds usher a colder airmass

are possible at times, mainly between 4 AM and 11 AM MST
Sunday morning, when the majority of precipitation is
anticipated to occur. Conditions may vary considerably from
county to county, or even within the same county.</description>
