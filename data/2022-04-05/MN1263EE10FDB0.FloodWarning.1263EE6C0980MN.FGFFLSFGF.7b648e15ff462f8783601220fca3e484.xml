<headline>Flood Warning issued April 05 at 10:32AM CDT until April 11 at 7:00AM CDT by NWS Eastern ND and Grand Forks</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in
Minnesota...North Dakota...
Two Rivers River near Hallock affecting Kittson County.
Red River of the North at Pembina affecting Kittson and Pembina
Counties.
Red River of the North at Drayton affecting Marshall, Kittson,
Walsh and Pembina Counties.
.The first flood wave of the spring season has now passed across the
international border into Canada with the Red River at Pembina
recently cresting. However, renewed rises are expected in the coming
days at some locations on the Red and on the Minnesota tributaries
(especially in southern portions of the basin). This is due to the
weather system currently impacting the region bringing rain, snow,
and some mixed precipitation.
Note that these river forecasts incorporate the precipitation that
has recently occurred in addition to forecast precipitation through
7 am Wednesday. Therefore, river forecasts will likely continue to
change in the coming days as the total precipitation from this
system is worked into the river forecasts.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
