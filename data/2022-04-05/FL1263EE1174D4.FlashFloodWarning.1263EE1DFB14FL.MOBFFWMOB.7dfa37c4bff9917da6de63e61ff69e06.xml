<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued April 05 at 2:37PM EDT until April 05 at 8:45PM EDT by NWS Mobile</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Mobile has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
Southeastern Okaloosa County in northwestern Florida...
* Until 745 PM CDT Tuesday.
* At 137 PM CDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing
heavy rain across the warned area. The expected rainfall rate is 1
to 3 inches in 1 hour. Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 4
inches are possible in the warned area. Flash flooding is ongoing
or expected to begin shortly.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban
areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as
other poor drainage and low-lying areas.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Wright, Fort Walton Beach, Niceville, Destin, Eglin AFB,
Valparaiso, Mary Esther, Lake Lorraine, Ocean City, Shalimar,
Cinco Bayou, Eglin Village, Longwood, Postil and Seminole.
Rain has not started across portions of the warned area; however,
will begin shortly with extremely heavy rain rates over notoriously
poor drainage areas. This coupled with likely training storms will
likely result in flash flooding.
