<description>...HEAVY RAINFALL POSSIBLE OVER THE WEEKEND...
A tropical disturbance, JTWC Invest 95W, centered near 5N150E is
drifting toward the west-northwest. It is expected to turn toward
the northwest,  moving toward Yap over the next few days. Latest
model guidance is in better agreement over the expected movement and
intensity of this system, though they still differ on timing, with
the GFS moving the system a bit faster than the ECMWF. All models
continue to show 95W remaining south of Guam. Rainfall amounts
continue to be the tricky part, with the ECMWF showing around 1.5
inches over Guam, decreasing northward to less than 0.5 inch for
Saipan, while the GFS shows amounts between 5 and 7 inches over the
Marianas through the weekend and up to 10 inches by Monday. Heavy
rainfall remains a possibility across the region as 95W strengthens
and moves northwest.
Localized flooding is possible in low-lying and poor drainage areas,
while flash flooding will be possible in areas of heaviest rainfall,
especially near steep terrain. Residents of the Marianas need to
closely monitor this developing situation as watches, advisories and
warnings could be issued later in the week. If living near streams
and rivers, prepare to move items away from stream and river banks.
Make sure storm drains nearby are not clogged, especially in
low-lying areas.
This outlook will be updated over the next couple of days with
additional information, or cancelled if the situation changes.</description>
