<description>This product covers the Hawaiian islands
**TROPICAL STORM CALVIN MOVING WESTWARD TOWARD THE BIG ISLAND**
**TROPICAL STORM WARNING ISSUED FOR HAWAII COUNTY**
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- The Tropical Storm Watch has been upgraded to a Tropical Storm
Warning for the Big Island
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for the Big Island
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 860 miles east-southeast of Honolulu or about 650 miles
east-southeast of Hilo
- 17.4N 145.4W
- Storm Intensity 45 mph
- Movement West or 275 degrees at 22 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
The center of Tropical Storm Calvin is forecast to pass over, or very
close to, the Big Island of Hawaii from Tuesday night into Wednesday.
Calvin will weaken as it moves westward to the south of the other
Hawaiian Islands Wednesday and Wednesday night, bringing the potential
for some peripheral impacts.
Primary impacts are expected on the Big Island, with a period of heavy
rainfall, high surf along east facing shores, and locally strong wind
gusts.
Flooding rain will be possible as early as Tuesday evening on the Big
Island, with chances for heavy rain expected to increase for much of
the state Tuesday night and Wednesday. Expect storm total rainfall of
4 to 8 inches across mainly windward portions of the Big Island, with
around 1 to 4 inches of rainfall elsewhere across the state.
Coastal impacts associated with Calvin will include rapidly building
surf Tuesday night through Wednesday. Surf heights will reach High
Surf Advisory levels for most windward coasts, with High Surf Warning
levels (greater than 15 feet) along east facing shores of the Big
Island. Although peak surf heights on the Big Island will likely occur
around low tide Wednesday morning, some minor overwash and erosion is
possible for exposed low-lying coastal areas.
Locally strong winds may begin as early as Tuesday evening across
parts of the Big Island, with north winds shifting to the northeast
and east as Calvin moves westward. Winds will primarily be
northeasterly over the smaller islands, strongest Wednesday and
Wednesday night. It is important to note that the mountainous terrain
of the islands can produce localized areas of enhanced winds, even
well away from the tropical cyclone center.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across the
Hawaiian islands. Potential impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* SURGE:
Prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited impacts
across portions of windward and southeast Big Island. Potential
impacts in this area include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread
with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where
surge water covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
Elsewhere across the Hawaiian islands, little to no impact is
anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant
impacts across mainly windward and southeastern portions of the Big
Island. Potential impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals,
arroyos, and ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
Prepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across other Hawaiian Islands from Kauai to Maui.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
the Hawaiian islands. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies
kit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your
home or business.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
NEXT UPDATE
-----------
The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather
Service in Honolulu HI around 11 PM HST, or sooner if conditions
warrant.</description>
