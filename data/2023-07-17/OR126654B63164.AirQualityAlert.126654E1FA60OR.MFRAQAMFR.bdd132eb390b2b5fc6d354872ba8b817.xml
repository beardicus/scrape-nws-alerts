<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM PDT WEDNESDAY...
Oregon Department of Environmental Quality has issued an Air
Pollution Advisory...in effect until 11 PM PDT Wednesday.
The Flat Fire near Agness combined with periods of easterly and
northerly winds will cause smoke concentrations to increase. Air
Quality is expected to reach unhealthy levels at times in southern
Curry and western Josephine County, but can fluctuate depending on
the weather.
Check current conditions on the Oregon Smoke Information Blog
oregonsmoke.org, DEQ’s Air Quality Index, or by downloading the free
OregonAIR app on your smartphone.
- Smoke can irritate the eyes and lungs and worsen some medical conditions.
People most at risk include infants and young children, people
with heart or lung disease, older adults and pregnant people.
- Protect yourself and your family when smoke levels are high:
- Stay inside if possible. Keep windows and doors closed. If it’s too
hot, run air conditioning on recirculate or consider moving to a
cooler location. Avoid strenuous outdoor activity.
- Use a high efficiency particulate air(HEPA) filter in indoor
ventilation systems or portable air purifiers.
- Be aware of smoke in your area and avoid places with the highest
levels.
- If you have a breathing plan for a medical condition, be sure to
follow it and keep any needed medications refilled.
