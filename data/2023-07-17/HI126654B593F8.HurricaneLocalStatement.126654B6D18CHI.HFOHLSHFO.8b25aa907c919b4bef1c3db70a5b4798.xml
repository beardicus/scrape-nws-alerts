Island Interior, Big Island North, Big Island South, Big Island
Southeast, Big Island Summits, Kohala, and Kona
* STORM INFORMATION:

SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
The center of Tropical Storm Calvin is forecast to pass over, or very
close to, the Big Island of Hawaii from Tuesday night into Wednesday.
Calvin is expected to weaken as it moves westward to the south of the
other Hawaiian Islands Wednesday and Wednesday night, bringing the
potential for some peripheral impacts.
Primary impacts are expected on the Big Island, where a period of
heavy rainfall is expected, as well as high surf along east facing
shores, and locally strong wind gusts.
Flooding rain will be possible as early as Tuesday evening on the Big
Island, and chances for heavy rain is expected to increase for much of
the state Tuesday night and Wednesday. Expect storm total rainfall of
4 to 8 inches across mainly windward portions of the Big Island, with
about 1 to 4 inches of rainfall elsewhere.
Coastal impacts associated with Calvin will include rapidly building
surf Tuesday night through Wednesday. Surf heights will reach High
Surf Advisory levels for most windward coasts, potentially reaching
High Surf Warning levels (greater than 15 feet) along east facing
shores of the Big Island. Although peak surf heights on the Big Island
will likely occur around low tide Wednesday morning, some minor
overwash and erosion is possible for exposed low-lying coastal areas.
Locally strong winds may begin as early as Tuesday evening across
parts of the Big Island, with north winds shifting to the northeast
and east as Calvin moves westward. Winds will primarily be
northeasterly over the smaller islands, strongest Wednesday and
Wednesday night. It is important to note that the mountainous terrain
of the islands can produce localized areas of enhanced winds, even
well away from the tropical cyclone center.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies
kit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your
home or business.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
winds, large surf, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from
the center of the storm.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for dangerous wind having possible significant imp acts across
portions of the Big Island. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
Elsewhere across the Hawaiian islands, little to no impact is
anticipated.
* SURGE:
Prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited impacts
across portions of windward and southeast Big Island. Potential impacts
in this area include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread
with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where
surge water covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
Elsewhere across the Hawaiian islands, little to no impact is
anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant
impacts across mainly windward and southeastern portions of the Big
Island. Potential impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals,
arroyos, and ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
Prepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across other Hawaiian Islands from Kauai to Maui.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
the Hawaiian islands. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
