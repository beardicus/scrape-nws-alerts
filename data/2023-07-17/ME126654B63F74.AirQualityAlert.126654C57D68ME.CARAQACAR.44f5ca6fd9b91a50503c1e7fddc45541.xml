<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM TUESDAY TO MIDNIGHT EDT
TUESDAY NIGHT...
The Maine Department of Environmental Protection`s Bureau of Air
Quality has issued an Air Quality Alert for particle pollution from
1 AM Tuesday to midnight EDT Tuesday night.
Particle pollution levels are expected to rise into the Unhealthy
For Sensitive Groups range on Tuesday.
Smoke from fires in western Canada has pushed into New York and the
rest of New England today. This smoke is expected to move into Maine
late this evening and reach the highest levels on Tuesday.
The Maine Department of Environmental Protection recommends that
individuals consider limiting strenuous outdoor physical activity to
reduce the risk of adverse health effects. People who may be
especially sensitive to the effects of elevated levels of pollutants
include the very young, the elderly, those with pre-existing
respiratory problems such as asthma, those with heart disease and
anyone who is working hard outdoors. But if you experience symptoms
such as shortness of breath, coughing, throat irritation or an
uncomfortable sensation in your chest please consider limiting the
intensity and duration of your outdoor activities.
A toll free air quality hotline has been established so Maine
residents can stay informed on the air quality situations. The toll
free number is: 1-800-223-1196.
Additionally the Maine Department of Environmental Protection has
the air quality forecast available on the web at
