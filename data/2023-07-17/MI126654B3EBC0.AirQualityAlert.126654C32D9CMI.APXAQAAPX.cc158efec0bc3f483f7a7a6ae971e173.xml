<description>...Air Quality Alert for Monday July 17th...
The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy has
extended the Air Quality Action Day through Monday July 17th for
elevated levels of fine particulate (PM2.5). Air Quality Index (AQI)
levels are expected to be in the Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (AQI
Orange) range.
The Action Day is in effect for the following Michigan counties...
Arenac and Gladwin.
Smoke originating from wildfires in west and central Canada continues
to move across central and southern lower Michigan, with increases
in PM2.5 expected. The Air Quality Index will likely increase into
the Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (Orange) range; however, hourly
concentrations reaching the Unhealthy (Red) level are possible.
Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including
asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults, should limit
prolonged or heavy exertion.
Reduce or eliminate activities that contribute to air pollution,
such as outdoor burning, and use of residential wood burning devices.
Reduce vehicle trips and vehicle idling as much as possible and
reduce refueling your vehicle.
Keep windows closed overnight to prevent smoke from getting indoors
and, if possible, run central air conditioning with MERV-13 or higher
rated filters.

Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy`s Air Quality page on the
