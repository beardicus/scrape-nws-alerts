<headline>Flood Watch issued August 19 at 1:53PM PDT  by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>.Hurricane Hilary is still expected to make landfall in the
northern part of the Baja of California on Sunday. While the system
will rapidly weaken, deep moisture will stream into the
Desert Southwest. Gusty winds along with prolong periods of moderate
to locally heavy rainfall will impact much of Nevada and eastern
California. The system will quickly exit the area Monday evening,
but showers and storm chances will linger through Tuesday.
...FLOOD WATCH NOW IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH LATE
MONDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of east central California, including the
following area, Mono County. Portions of Nevada, including the
following areas, Mineral and Southern Lyon Counties and Western
Nevada Basin and Range including Pyramid Lake.
* WHEN...From Sunday afternoon through late Monday night.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water
crossings may be flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Hurricane Hilary will bring widespread impacts to much of the
Southwest through early week. The biggest concern remains
flooding from excessive rainfall. While periods of rainfall
are possible at anytime over the next 4 days, Sunday
afternoon through Monday will be the window where we will
have the greatest flooding threat as the remnants of Hilary
moves through central Nevada.
