<headline>Flood Watch issued August 19 at 10:59PM PDT until August 21 at 8:00AM PDT by NWS LasVegas</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of southern Nevada, including the following
areas, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Las Vegas Valley,
Northeast Clark County, Sheep Range, Southern Clark County, Spring
Mountains-Red Rock Canyon and Western Clark and Southern Nye
County.
* WHEN...Through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Area creeks
and streams are running high and could flood with more heavy rain.
Outdoor recreation will be very dangerous in the Spring Mountains
including Mt. Charleston and Red Rock, and is strongly
ill-advised. Absolutely do not enter concrete washes in the Las
Vegas Valley. These washes will become very dangerous and
potentially deadly.
