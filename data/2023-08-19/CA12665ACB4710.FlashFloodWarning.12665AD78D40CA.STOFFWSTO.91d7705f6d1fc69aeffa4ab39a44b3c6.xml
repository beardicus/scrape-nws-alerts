FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>This is a life-threatening situation. Heavy rainfall will cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks...streams...and
ditches in the McFarland Burn Scar. Severe debris flows can also be
anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may be washed away in
places. If you encounter flood waters...climb to safety.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry areas is likely. The heavy rains will
likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.</instruction>
