<description>...There is an increasing risk of flooding across Puerto Rico and
the U.S. Virgin Islands early in the upcoming week...
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure
(AL90)...now located near the Windward Islands...are forecast to
reach and spread across Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
starting late tomorrow (Sunday night) and stretching into the
middle of the workweek.
Numerous showers and isolated to scattered thunderstorms are
expected to reach the U.S. Virgin Islands and eastern Puerto Rico
beginning late Sunday night into early Monday morning, spreading
across the rest of Puerto Rico by midday Monday. The potential for
showers and thunderstorms will continue Monday night into
Tuesday. The resulting rains will increase the risk for urban and
small stream flooding as well as flash flooding, which could also
lead to mudslides and rapid river rises.
Based on the most recent guidance, the most likely period for
scattered to widespread rains is Monday afternoon into Tuesday
morning, with the areas most likely to receive the highest rainfall
accumulations across eastern and southern sections of Puerto Rico.
In these areas, there is the potential for rainfall totals to
reach 4-6 inches with isolated higher amounts. Elsewhere across
Puerto Rico and across the U.S. Virgin Islands, rainfall totals
of 1-3 inches with isolated higher amounts are possible.
This product will be updated as needed. Please, continue to monitor
the progress of this feature, which based on the most recent
tropical weather outlook, has a medium to high formation chance
within the next 2-7 days.</description>
