<headline>Flood Watch issued August 19 at 1:31AM MST until August 20 at 10:00PM MST by NWS Phoenix</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM MST /8 AM PDT/ THIS
MORNING THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Arizona, including the following areas, Aguila
Valley, Central La Paz, Gila Bend, Gila River Valley, Kofa, Parker
Valley, Sonoran Desert Natl Monument, Southeast Yuma County,
Tonopah Desert, West Pinal County and Yuma. Portions of
California, including the following areas, Chiriaco Summit,
Chuckwalla Mountains, Chuckwalla Valley, Imperial County
Southeast, Imperial County Southwest, Imperial County West,
Imperial Valley, Joshua Tree NP East, Joshua Tree NP West, Palo
Verde Valley and Salton Sea.
* WHEN...From 8 AM MST /8 AM PDT/ this morning through Monday
afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Area creeks
and streams are running high and could flood with more heavy rain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A rich moisture plume will accompany tropical cyclone Hilary
as it progresses into Southern California this weekend. This
will result in widespread heavy rainfall across Southern
California and Southwestern Arizona. A combination of rapid
onset and slow response flooding is expected with high
rainfall rates and totals. Rainfall totals will be highest in
the mountains of Southern California, in upslope favored
regions, and with banding features. With rainfall amounts
forecast around 2-6 inches along and west of the Lower
Colorado River Valley, and localized amounts up to 10 inches
possible across higher terrain areas including Joshua Tree
National Park, there is potential for widespread significant
flooding, and localized catastrophic flooding, across the
region.
