<description>...HEAT ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM CDT THIS EVENING...
...HEAT ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM NOON MONDAY TO 10 PM CDT
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...For the Heat Advisory ending at 8 PM this evening, heat
index values around 105 to 110 are expected. For the Heat
Advisory in effect from noon on Monday through Wednesday
evening, heat index values around 100 to 105 are expected.
* WHERE...Valley, Greeley, Sherman, Dawson and Gosper Counties.
* WHEN...For the first Heat Advisory, until 8 PM CDT this
evening. For the second Heat Advisory, from noon Monday to 10
PM CDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Hot temperatures and high humidity may cause heat
illnesses to occur.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...While this prolonged stretch of heat will
last well into next week, today will feature the lightest winds,
and thus the least relief from the stifling conditions. Stronger
southwest winds closer to 15 to 20 MPH will prevail Monday
through Wednesday. Although it will be hot again Sunday, heat
index readings are expected to remain slightly below 105 degrees
and thus there is no Advisory for Sunday at this time.</description>
<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
