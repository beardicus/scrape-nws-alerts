<headline>Flood Watch issued August 19 at 2:07AM PDT  by NWS Elko</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THIS EVENING THROUGH LATE
MONDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of eastern, north central, northeast, northwest,
and south central Nevada, including the following areas, in
eastern Nevada, White Pine County. In north central Nevada,
Northern Lander County and Northern Eureka County and Southern
Lander County and Southern Eureka County. In northeast Nevada,
Northern Elko County, Ruby Mountains and East Humboldt Range,
South Central Elko County, Southeastern Elko County and Southwest
Elko County. In northwest Nevada, Humboldt County. In south
central Nevada, Northeastern Nye County and Northwestern Nye
County.
* WHEN...From this evening through late Monday night.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water
crossings may be flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Deep Tropical moisture is forecast to move northward into
portions of northern Nye County, Southern Lander and Eureka
Counties, White Pine counties and southern Elko County mainly
affecting the Ruby Mountains starting late on Saturday
lasting at least through Monday morning. The moisture,
atmospheric instability, and weak lift associated with the
decaying remnants of Hilary will aid in the potential for
moderate to heavy rainfall and the potential of localized
heavy rainfall from thunderstorms that could lead to flash
flooding.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
