<description>...Shower and thunderstorm chances continue today...
...Heavy rain and flood potential Sunday-Monday...
* Showers and thunderstorms are developing again this afternoon
and evening. These storms will be capable of gusts in excess of
45 mph which could kick up dust from desert sinks and playas, in
addition to localized heavy rainfall and small hail.
* Hurricane Hilary in the eastern Pacific is expected to make
landfall Sunday along northwestern portion of Baja of
California. While this system will rapidly weaken by the time it
reaches Nevada, significant amounts of moisture will bring
periods of heavy rainfall to the region Sunday afternoon through
Monday. The greatest threat for flooding is across the Basin &amp;
Range and the eastern Sierra. Please see the Flash Flood Watch
for additional details. Have multiple ways to receive alerts in
case flood warnings are issued, and never drive through flooded
roadways.
* Abundant cloud cover and rainfall will keep afternoon high
temperatures 10 to 20 degrees below normal Sunday through
Tuesday, with Monday likely being the coolest day of the week.
* The center of what is left of Hilary will move through central
Nevada Sunday night into Monday. Across the Basin and Range,
expect breezy/gusty conditions with gusts of 35-45 mph and
locally higher inside any intense storm cores. If the track of
Hilary shifts farther west, winds may become gustier for more of
the region. See the Wind Advisory for more information.
* Stay tuned to the National Hurricane Center by visiting
www.hurricanes.gov for the latest on Hilary.</description>
