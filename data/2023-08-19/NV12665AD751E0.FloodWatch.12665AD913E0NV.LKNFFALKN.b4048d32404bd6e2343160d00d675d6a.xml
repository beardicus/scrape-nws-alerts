* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.

and south central Nevada, including the following areas, in
eastern Nevada, White Pine County. In north central Nevada,
Northern Lander County and Northern Eureka County and Southern
Lander County and Southern Eureka County. In northeast Nevada,
Northern Elko County, Ruby Mountains and East Humboldt Range,
South Central Elko County, Southeastern Elko County and Southwest

* Areas that could see significant flooding and impacts from this
system are southern Lander and Eureka Counties, White Pine, and
Northern Nye counties.
* WHEN...From 11 PM PDT this evening through late Monday night.
* Moderate to heavy rain starting along and south of Highway 50
overnight.
* Moderate to heavy rain reaching up to at least Interstate 80 during
the day on Sunday
* Potential for moderate to heavy rain covering most of northeast and
central NV by Monday
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage, roadways, culverts, and urban
areas. Locations with know low-water crossings will likely be
flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- - Deep Tropical moisture is forecast to move northward into
portions of northern Nye County, Southern Lander and Eureka
Counties, White Pine counties and southern Elko County mainly
affecting the Ruby Mountains starting late on Saturday
lasting at least through Monday morning. The moisture,
atmospheric instability, and weak lift associated with the
decaying remnants of Hilary will aid in the potential for
moderate to heavy rainfall and the potential of localized
heavy rainfall from thunderstorms that could lead to flash
flooding.
