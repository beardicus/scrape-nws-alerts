<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING FOR THE MCKINNEY BURN SCAR REMAINS IN EFFECT
UNTIL 530 PM PDT THIS AFTERNOON FOR NORTH CENTRAL SISKIYOU COUNTY...
At 447 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing heavy
rain over the McKinney Burn Scar. Between 0.2 and 1 inch of rain has
already fallen. The expected rainfall rate is 0.5 to 1 inches in 1
hour. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through some drainage basins, which include...McKinney Creek,
Barkhouse Creek, Humbug Creek, Little Humbug Creek, and Vesa Creek.
The debris flow can consist of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose
materials.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms in and around the
McKinney Burn Scar.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...High water and debris could impact Highway 96 and
Klamath River Road.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
EXPECTED RAINFALL RATE...0.5-1 INCH IN 1 HOUR</description>
<instruction>This is a life threatening situation. Heavy rainfall will cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks...streams...and
ditches in the McKinney Burn Scar. Severe debris flows can also be
anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may be washed away in
places. If you encounter flood waters...climb to safety.
Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
