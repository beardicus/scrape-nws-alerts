<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued August 19 at 7:11PM PDT until August 19 at 10:30PM PDT by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Medford has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
The McKinney burn scar in...
North Central Siskiyou County in northern California...
* Until 1030 PM PDT.
* At 711 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated additional thunderstorms
producing heavy rain over the McKinney Burn Scar. Between 0.5 and
1 inch of rain has already fallen. The expected rainfall rate is
0.5 to 1 inches in 1 hour. Additional rainfall amounts of 0.2 to
0.8 inches are possible in the warned area. Flash flooding is
ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through drainage basins, which include...McKinney Creek,
Barkhouse Creek, Humbug Creek, Little Humbug Creek, and Vesa Creek.
The debris flow can consist of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose
materials.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms in and around
the McKinney Burn Scar.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...High water and debris could impact Highway 96 and
Klamath River Road.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
EXPECTED RAINFALL RATE...1-2 INCHES IN 1 HOUR</description>
<instruction>This is a life threatening situation. Heavy rainfall will cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks...streams...and
ditches in the McKinney Burn Scar. Severe debris flows can also be
anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may be washed away in
places. If you encounter flood waters...climb to safety.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
