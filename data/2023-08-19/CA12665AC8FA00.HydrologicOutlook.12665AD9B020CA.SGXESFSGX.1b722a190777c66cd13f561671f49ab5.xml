<headline>Hydrologic Outlook issued August 19 at 1:48AM PDT  by NWS SanDiego</headline>
<description>.Significant flow expected in the Whitewater River and the
Coachella Storm Water Channel by Sunday night.
Rain is forecast to develop over the San Bernardino Mountains and
northern portions of the Coachella Valley today, and become heavy
on Sunday. Rainfall of 6 to 12 inches will be possible over the
mountains by Monday morning...with several inches possible at
lower elevations.
As the soils become saturated and runoff accelerates, significant
flows will develop in the Whitewater River. These flows are
forecast to reach Palm Springs Sunday night...and flow southward
through the Coachella Valley to Indio and beyond through Monday.
The flow will impact low-water crossings and may create dangerous
swift-water areas through the valley.
Residents should be prepared for road closures and listen for
later advisories.</description>
