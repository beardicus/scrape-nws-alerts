<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 745 PM MDT THIS
EVENING FOR WEST CENTRAL KANE AND EAST CENTRAL WASHINGTON COUNTIES...
At 624 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated prior thunderstorms produced
heavy rain across western portions of Zion National Park,
particularly through Parunuweap Canyon, Pine Creek, Lower Clear
Creek, Spry Canyon, and Keyhole Canyon. Approximately 0.50 and 1.25
inches of rain had fallen. Zion Dispatch reported multiple small
waterfalls throughout the park, and the East Fork Virgin River Gage
near Springdale recorded a rapid streamflow increase peaking near
800 CFS. Additional rainfall amounts of 0.25 to 0.50 inches are
possible in the warned area with showers and thunderstorms moving
over the park. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin
shortly.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms producing
flash flooding.

slot canyons, and typically dry washes.

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood

washes, streams, and rivers can become raging killer currents in a
matter of minutes, even from distant rainfall.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
