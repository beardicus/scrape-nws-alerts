<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued March 20 at 2:50PM CDT until March 21 at 8:00PM CDT by NWS Brownsville</headline>
<description>...Rapid Wildfire Growth and Erratic Spread Possible Monday...
.Very strong southerly winds are expected on Monday due to low
pressure developing across the Southern Plains interacting with
broad high pressure centered over the Mid-Atlantic region. When
combined with abundant cured fuels and very warm temperatures,
conditions will be very favorable for wildfires that can grow
rapidly and spread erratically. As a result, a Fire Weather Watch
is in effect Monday for all of Deep South Texas and the Rio Grande
Valley.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY MORNING THROUGH
MONDAY EVENING FOR FOR STRONG WINDS AND ABUNDANT CURED FUELS FOR
ALL OF DEEP SOUTH TEXAS...
The National Weather Service in Brownsville has issued a Fire
Weather Watch, which is in effect from Monday morning through
Monday evening.
* AFFECTED AREA...Zapata County.
* TIMING...10 AM CDT to 8 PM CDT Monday.
* WIND...20-foot southerly winds between 25 MPH and 35 MPH.
* HUMIDITY...Between 25 and 45 percent for Starr, Jim Hogg,
Hidalgo, and Brooks counties, and between 45 and 55 percent
for Cameron, Willacy, and Kenedy counties.
* IMPACTS...any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly.
Outdoor burning is not recommended.</description>
<instruction>A fire weather watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are forecast to occur. In general...these conditions include
sustained 20 foot winds of 25 MPH or greater...humidity ranging
from below 25 percent in Zapata County to below 45 percent along
the coast...each lasting for 2 hours or more...and cured fuels.
Humidity below 25 percent in most areas will trigger fire danger
at lower wind speeds. Detailed decision tables are found at
