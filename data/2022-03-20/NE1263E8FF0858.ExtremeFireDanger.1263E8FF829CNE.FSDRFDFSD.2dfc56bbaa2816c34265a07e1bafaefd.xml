<description>.DISCUSSION...
Forecast soundings this morning continue to show mixing quickly
overtaking the stout low level inversion by early to mid this
afternoon, pulling the warmer and drier air down. As was mentioned
in the previous discussion, winds through and above the mixed layer
is likely to mix down south to southwesterly gusts around 30 mph,
with gusts to 35 mph if mixing is more efficient west of I-29.
RAP/HRRR models continue to be the driest; however, the NAM and GFS
have both trended a bit more in this direction. Continued to trend
in the forecast on the drier side, leading to minimum humidity
values from 15-30% across the forecast area, with the lowest values
mostly along and west of I-29.
Thus, have maintained the previously issued Red Flag Warning and
resolved the Fire Weather Watch to a Red Flag Warning as well. There
remains some uncertainty in timing correlation of the lowest
humidity and the strongest winds but dry antecedent conditions and
the potential for more efficient mixing are enough to overcome this
uncertainty. Additionally, will monitor areas to the north and east
of the currently issued headlines, should winds outperform
forecast or humidity values drop more than anticipated.
People are urged to exercise extreme care with respect to outdoor
activities that could cause grass fires. Avoid equipment that can
cause sparks near dry grass or brush. Do not toss cigarettes on
the ground. Report new fires quickly to the nearest fire
department or law enforcement office.
Exercise caution during off road use of your vehicle as the
catalytic converter can start wildfires.
...EXTREME FIRE DANGER...
The Grassland Fire Danger Index will reach the extreme category
this afternoon. Extreme weather conditions and very low
moisture content of grasses, and other dry organic material
on the ground, indicate that critical burning conditions exist.
All fires have the potential to become large and spread quickly,
becoming erratic with extreme behavioral characteristics.
No outdoor burning should take place.
OUTLOOK FOR MONDAY AFTERNOON...The Grassland Fire Danger Index
will reach the very high category.
The grassland fire danger product reflects fire danger for native
grasses. It is not intended for cured agricultural crops, nor
will it reflect conditions in road ditches which have been mowed.</description>
