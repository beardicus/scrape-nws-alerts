SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------

Tropical Depression Three is expected to approach the South

before landfall. The largest impact on the Carolinas should be locally
heavy rainfall with an isolated flooding potential Saturday night
through Sunday.

POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------

* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across southeast North Carolina and northeast South
Carolina. Potential impacts include:
- Localized flooding from rainfall may occur, especially in
low-lying and poor drainage areas. Some rivers and creeks may
rise as a result of the rain. Small streams, creeks, and
ditches may overflow in some locations.
- Several storm drains and retention ponds may become full and
begin to overflow. Some brief road closures are possible.

* TORNADOES:
Little impacts are anticipated at this time
across southeast North Carolina and northeast South Carolina.

* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
northeastern South Carolina. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Unsecured lightweight objects may be blown about.
- Some large limbs may break from trees.
- Hazardous driving conditions are possible, especially for high
profile vehicles on bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages are possible.

Elsewhere across southeast North Carolina and northeast South
Carolina, little to no wind impact is anticipated.

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------

* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:

When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track as there are inherent forecast uncertainties
which must be taken into account.

Always heed the advice of local officials.

Closely monitor NOAA Weather Radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for possible changes to the
forecast.
