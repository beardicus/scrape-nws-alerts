SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------

A Tropical Depression off the Southeast U.S. coast will slowly
track towards the Carolina coast tonight into Saturday. As the system
approaches, it could become better organized and strengthen into a
Tropical Storm. The system is expected to track onshore along the
South Carolina coast Sunday morning.

As the system nears the coast, it is expected to interact with an area
of high pressure centered over the Mid Atlantic states, resulting in
gusty northeast winds north of the center of low pressure. Wind gusts
are forecast to remain the strongest along the South Carolina beaches,
with gusts up to 35 to 40 mph. In addition, wind gusts across the high
bridges of Highway 17 and Interstate 526 may exceed 45 mph at times on
Saturday.

Rain bands should push onshore along the coast of the South Carolina
Lowcountry early Saturday morning. These rain bands may drift slowly
inland as the system nears the coast Saturday into Saturday night. It
is possible that showers and thunderstorms could repeatedly pass over
the same areas Saturday afternoon through late Saturday night,
possibly leading to areas of excessive rainfall. In addition, heavy
rainfall could occur during the late afternoon high tide on Saturday,
potentially increasing the risk of flooding across coastal cities and
locations near tidal waterways.

Gusty winds and increasing wave activity may result in strong rip
currents along the South Carolina and Georgia coast through this
weekend. The potential for rip currents appears greatest on Saturday.

POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------

* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
Charleston County. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or uprooted,
but with greater numbers in places where trees are shallow
rooted.
- Some roads impassable due to debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded locations. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways, especially for high
profile vehicles.
- Isolated to scattered power and communications outages.

Elsewhere across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia,
little to no impact is anticipated.

* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across South Carolina Lowcountry. Potential impacts
include:
- Localized rainfall flooding could prompt a few rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries could quickly rise with swifter
currents. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches could
become swollen and overflow in spots.
- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in normally
vulnerable spots. Rapid ponding of water could occur at
underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage areas. Several
storm drains and retention ponds become near-full and begin to
overflow. Some brief road and bridge closures.

Elsewhere across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia,
little to no impact is anticipated.

* OTHER COASTAL HAZARDS:
Gusty winds and increasing wave activity may result in strong rip
currents along the South Carolina and Georgia coast through this
weekend. The potential for rip currents appears greatest on Saturday.

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------

* EVACUATIONS:
Follow the advice of local officials.

* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
