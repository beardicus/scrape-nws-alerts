        <headline>Flood Warning issued July 4 at 1:39AM CDT until July 7 at 7:00PM CDT by NWS Midland/Odessa TX</headline>

Texas affecting Presidio County.

Rio Grande at Rio Grande near Castolon, Texas affecting Brewster
County.

Rio Grande at Rio Grande at Rio Grande Village, BBNP, Texas
affecting Brewster County.

Rio Grande at Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch near Castolon, Texas
affecting Brewster County.

For the Rio Grande...including Rio Grande above Rio Conchos near
Presidio,  Texas, Rio Grande at Presidio Vehicle Bridge, Rio Grande
below Rio Conchos near Presidio,  Texas, Rio Grande near Castolon,
Texas, Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch near Castolon,  Texas, Rio Grande
at Rio Grande Village,  BBNP,  Texas, Rio Grande near Dryden,

forecast.

* WHAT...Major flooding is occurring and major flooding is forecast.

* WHERE...Rio Grande at Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch near Castolon,
Texas.

* WHEN...Until Monday evening.

* IMPACTS...At 12.0 feet (3.7 meters), the river reaches bankfull,
minor lowland flooding occurs, and no significant damage is
expected.
At 15.0 feet (4.6 meters), flood stage is reached.  Moderate
lowland flooding begins.  Roads that lead to Cottonwood Campground
and River Road may flood.  Stages are practically synonymous with
the gage at Cottonwood Campground at Castolon (CSTT2), and
therefore represent the reach from Santa Elena Canyon through
Cottonwood Campground, where damage may occur.  Cattle also graze
in the lowlands, and may be threatened.
At 19.0 feet (5.8 meters), the river reaches major flood stage.
Flooding begins to occur upstream in Cottonwood Campground at
Castolon, as stages at each location are practically synonymous.
Moderate lowland flooding begins at the gage site, but no damage
occurs.  The gage is inaccessible, as River Road is impassable at
several locations.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1:15 AM CDT Friday the stage was 19.9 feet (6.1 meters).
- Bankfull stage is 12.0 feet (3.7 meters).
- Recent Activity...The maximum river stage in the 24 hours
ending at 1:15 AM CDT Friday was 19.9 feet (6.1 meters).
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise to a crest of 21.9
feet (6.7 meters) this afternoon. It will then fall below
flood stage Monday morning.
- Flood stage is 15.0 feet (4.6 meters).
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
22.0 feet (6.7 meters) on 06/03/2019.

        <instruction>

Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.

Caution is urged when walking near riverbanks.

Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.

Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.

Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.

The next statement will be issued this afternoon at 145 PM CDT.</instruction>
