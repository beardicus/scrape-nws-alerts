<headline>Flood Warning issued May 16 at 9:24PM CDT until May 19 at 4:00PM CDT by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in
Minnesota...

...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in
Minnesota...
Minnesota River at Savage affecting Dakota, Carver, Hennepin and
Scott Counties.
.Flooding continues for points along the Cottonwood River in
southwestern Minnesota as well as the main stem Minnesota River due
to the rainfall from last week and over the weekend. As the water
continues to move downstream, and barring any further significant
rainfall, we should see river levels steadily decrease over the next
couple of weeks. Some showers are possible along a cold front on
Thursday into Friday, however this should not cause any impacts to
current forecasts due to how quickly the showers move through and
the limited moisture to work with.
...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL FRIDAY AFTERNOON...
