<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM IN EFFECT THROUGH WEDNESDAY MORNING
ALONG THE KUSKOKWIM RIVER DOWNSTREAM OF KALSKAG TO KWETHLUK...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam is possible.
* WHERE...The Kuskokwim River downstream of Kalskag to Kwethluk.
* WHEN...Through Wednesday morning.
* IMPACTS...The breakup front on the Kuskokwim is progressing
steadily downstream  past Kalskag. Heavy runs of bank to bank ice
have been reported at Kalskag beginning late Monday night with
water levels rising as the front pushes through causing flooding
of low lying areas. The breakup front is expected to reach
Tuluksak, Akiak, Akiachak, and Kwethluk by the end of the day
Tuesday.  Water levels will rise as the breakup front passes and
potentially flood low lying areas. In place sheet ice was observed
by the River Watch team yesterday from below Kalskag down to
Bethel. The ice was weaker and more deteriorated so the threat of
an ice jam is lower but the potential still exists for ice jam
related flooding in these communities.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Ice jam flooding has high uncertainty. Impacts could range
between localized high water and severe flooding. Now is the
time to take precautions. Where possible, move items to
higher ground and prepare your community for possible
flooding.
