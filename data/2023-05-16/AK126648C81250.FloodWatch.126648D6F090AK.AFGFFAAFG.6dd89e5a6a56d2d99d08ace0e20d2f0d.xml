<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH WEDNESDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues to be possible.
* WHERE...The Yukon River at Tanana
* WHEN...Through Wednesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Ice jam flooding is possible at Tanana through
Wednesday. If an ice jam forms, water will rise very rapidly and
people may need to evacuate to higher ground at a moments notice.
Prepare your community now for flooding, and where possible, move
items to higher ground.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The River Watch Team reports the breakup front moved past
Tanana Tuesday afternoon, with an approximately 120 mile run
of bank-to-bank ice chunks and pans. In place ice sheets
downriver from Tanana are weakening, but there is still the
possibility of an ice jam forming. In addition, water levels
will rise to bankfull levels due to the high volume of ice
and water associated with the ice run moving past the
community.

- If you live near or along the Yukon River near Tanana stay alert
and be prepared to take action.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
