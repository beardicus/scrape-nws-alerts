<description>...HEATING UP WITH RISES ON AREA WATERWAYS, WITH THUNDERSTORM
CHANCES RETURNING BY LATE WEEK INTO THE WEEKEND...
Heat:
* Highs will warm 15-20 degrees above average by late this week.
This translates to upper-80s and lower 90s across western Nevada
valleys and mid-upper 70s for Sierra valleys. The warmest days
are most likely on Friday and Saturday, with record highs
possible and potential for moderate heat risks to sensitive
individuals in warmer western Nevada valleys.
Snowmelt and River Rises:
* Rising temperatures will continue accelerating snowmelt this
week. If planning outdoor recreation, avoid streams and rivers
as they will flow fast, cold, and high. While it may seem like a
good idea to jump into the rivers to cool off, the water is
extremely cold and shock can quickly set in, causing loss of
motor function. There are also likely to be snow bridges present
in the backcountry with water flowing beneath them. Use extreme
caution.
* The latest forecasts indicate the East and West Forks and
mainstem Walker River reaching minor to moderate flood stage
later this week and into the weekend, while the East and West
Forks of the Carson River could reach minor flood stage during
the same time frame. For more detailed river forecasts, visit
www.cnrfc.noaa.gov.
Shower and Thunderstorm Chances:
* Shower and thunderstorm chances return by Friday afternoon, but
will be spotty, with a 10-15% chance mainly in Mono and southern
Mineral counties, and also near the Oregon border. The
thunderstorm risk could expand across eastern California and
western Nevada by the weekend, with a 15-25% chance for a storm
at any given location.</description>
