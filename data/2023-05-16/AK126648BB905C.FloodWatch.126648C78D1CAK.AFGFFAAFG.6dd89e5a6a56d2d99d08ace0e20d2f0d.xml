<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM AKDT THIS EVENING
THROUGH WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam is possible.
* WHERE...Including the following area, the community of Tanana
along the Yukon River.
* WHEN...From 6 PM AKDT this evening through Wednesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Ice jam flooding is possible at Tanana tonight or
Wednesday. If an ice jam forms, water will rise very rapidly and
people may need to evacuate to higher ground at a moments notice.
Large ice chunks could also push overbank and into communities.
Prepare your community now for flooding, and where possible, move
items to higher ground.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The breakup front is moving past Tanana this afternoon, with
an approximately 120 mile run of bank-to-bank ice chunks and
pans approaching Tanana from Rampart Canyon as reported from
the RiverWatch flight team. There is still ice in place 40
miles downriver from Tanana, and when the upstream run of ice
reaches this point, it may potentially jam and cause
significant water level rises at Tanana.

- If you live near or along the Yukon River near Tanana stay alert
and be prepared to take action.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
