<description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in

...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in
Minnesota...
Minnesota River at Savage affecting Dakota, Carver, Hennepin and
Scott Counties.
.Flooding continues for points along the Cottonwood River in
southwestern Minnesota as well as the main stem Minnesota River due
to the rainfall from last week and over the weekend. As the water
continues to move downstream, and barring any further significant
rainfall, we should see river levels steadily decrease over the next
couple of weeks. Some showers are possible along a cold front on
Thursday into Friday, however this should not cause any impacts to
current forecasts due to how quickly the showers move through and
the limited moisture to work with.
...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL EARLY SATURDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Moderate flooding is occurring and moderate flooding is
forecast.
* WHERE...Cottonwood River Above Springfield.
* WHEN...Until early Saturday morning.

- At 830 PM CDT Tuesday, the stage was 27.7 feet.
- Recent Activity...The maximum river stage in the 24 hours
ending at 830 PM CDT Tuesday was 28.2 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to fall below flood stage
Friday morning and continue falling to 17.0 feet Tuesday
evening.
