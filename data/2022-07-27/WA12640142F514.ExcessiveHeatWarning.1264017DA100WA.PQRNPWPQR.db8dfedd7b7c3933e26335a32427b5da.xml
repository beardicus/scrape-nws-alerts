<headline>Excessive Heat Warning issued July 27 at 12:49PM PDT until July 30 at 9:00PM PDT by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...EXCESSIVE HEAT WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM PDT
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...High heat risk. High temperatures 98F to 103F. Low
temperatures 60F to 70F.
* WHERE...In Oregon, Upper Hood River Valley, Western Columbia
River Gorge and Central Columbia River Gorge. In Washington,
Western Columbia River Gorge and Central Columbia River Gorge.
* WHEN...Until 9 PM PDT Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Extreme heat will significantly increase the
potential for heat related illnesses, particularly for those
working or participating in outdoor activities and for those
that do not have access to air conditioning.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...There is a 40% chance that high
temperatures will begin to drop into the low 90s or lower by
Sunday. Overnight lows in the mid to upper 60s across the higher
hills of the region will provide little relief for those without
air conditioning. Low temperatures in low lying areas,
particularly in the upper Hood River Valley will drop into the
upper 50s to low 60s most nights between now and Saturday.</description>
<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances. If attempting to find relief from the
heat in rivers, lakes, or the ocean please apply safe water
practices and wear a life preserver.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
