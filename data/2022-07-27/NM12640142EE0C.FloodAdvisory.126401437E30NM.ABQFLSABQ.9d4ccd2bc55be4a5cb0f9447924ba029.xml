<instruction>Do not camp along streams and rivers. Remain alert when hiking in
steep, narrow canyons. Know where you are relative to low spots and
drainages.
Both localized and distant heavy rainfall will create sudden and
dangerous flows in arroyos and over low water crossings.
Remember, ditches are deadly. A gentle flow of water can become a
raging torrent in a few minutes.</instruction>
