<headline>Excessive Heat Warning issued July 27 at 12:49PM PDT until July 30 at 9:00PM PDT by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...EXCESSIVE HEAT WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM PDT
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...High heat risk. High temperatures 97F to 102F. Low
temperatures 60F to 70F.
* WHERE...In Oregon, Greater Portland Metro Area. In Washington,
Greater Vancouver Area.
* WHEN...Until 9 PM PDT Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Extreme heat will significantly increase the
potential for heat related illnesses, particularly for those
working or participating in outdoor activities and for those
that do not have access to air conditioning.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...There is a 50% chance that high
temperatures will drop into the low 90s or lower Sunday.
Overnight lows 65-70F in the Portland/Vancouver Metro and higher
hills of the region will provide little relief for those without
air conditioning. Low temperatures in more rural low lying
areas, particularly in western Washington County and northern
Clark County will drop into the low 60s most nights between now
and Saturday.</description>
<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances. If attempting to find relief from the
heat in rivers, lakes, or the ocean please apply safe water
practices and wear a life preserver.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
