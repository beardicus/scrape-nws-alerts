<headline>Flood Watch issued July 27 at 3:17AM EDT  by NWS Blacksburg</headline>
<description>.A weak frontal boundary will remain stalled across the region
today. Scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms will
continue to track along and near the frontal boundary resulting in
additional and repeated rainfall to the same areas.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
The National Weather Service in Blacksburg has issued a
* Flood Watch for portions of Virginia and southeast West
Virginia, including the following areas, in Virginia,
Alleghany VA, Bland, Giles, Grayson, Smyth, and Tazewell. In
southeast West Virginia, Eastern Greenbrier, Mercer, Monroe,
Summers, and Western Greenbrier.
* Through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Repeated moderate to heavy rainfall on saturated
ground from recent rainfall will result in excessive runoff into
area creeks, streams, and other low-lying, poor drainage, and
other flood-pone locations. Area creeks and streams are running
high in areas that have seen heavy rainfall during the past few
days and additional heavy rain could result in flooding.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...From two to four inches of rain has fallen
in parts of the Flood Watch area during the past couple of days.
Additional rainfall of 2 to locally 4 inches is possible again
today. Locations within the Flood Watch area most susceptible to
flooding include Tazewell, Mercer and Greenbrier counties. In
areas of steep terrain, mudslides and landslides will be
possible where heavy rainfall occurs in a short time period.</description>
<instruction>A Flood Watch means there is a potential for flooding based on
current forecasts.
You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible
Flood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be
prepared to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
