<headline>Flood Watch issued July 27 at 2:33PM MDT  by NWS Pueblo</headline>
<description>.The potential for localized flash flooding will increase on
Thursday across a large part of south-central and southeast Colorado.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY MORNING THROUGH THURSDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...A large portion of south-central and southeast Colorado,
including the mountains, mountain valleys, and nearby plains.
* WHEN...From Thursday morning through Thursday evening.
* IMPACTS...Heavy rainfall could result in flash flooding of
low-lying areas, creeks, streams and canyons, and other
flood-prone locations, along with debris flows. Flash flooding
could become significant in a few locations, especially if
repeated rounds of heavy rainfall were to affect flood-prone
areas. Burn scars will be especially susceptible to flash flooding.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The coverage and intensity of showers and thunderstorms are
forecast to increase through the day on Thursday, with
scattered to numerous activity affecting the Watch area
Thursday afternoon and evening. Very heavy rainfall may
accompany this activity, which will have the potential to
result in localized flash flooding. While showers and
thunderstorms will lessen in coverage Thursday night, heavy
rainfall could continue into the overnight hours in some
locations, prolonging the flooding potential. More rounds of
heavy showers and thunderstorms may extend the risk for flash
flooding into Friday.
