        <headline>Flood Advisory issued June 22 at 4:34PM AKDT until June 24 at 10:00PM AKDT by NWS Anchorage AK</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...Flooding caused by snowmelt continues.

* WHERE...the Yentna and Skwentna Rivers and other nearby
tributaries.

* WHEN...Until 1000 PM AKDT Tuesday.

* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 424 PM AKDT, temperatures across the region have moderated
some, but snowmelt at higher elevations of the Western Alaska
Range is still leading to higher water levels across much of
the Susitna Valley, especially along the Yentna and Skwentna
Rivers. This will cause the minor flooding in low lying areas
along these rivers to persist through Tuesday evening. River
levels will be highest during the late afternoon and evening
hours in response to peak melting at the warmest time of day.
The gradual cooling of temperatures should allow water levels
to begin to fall by mid week.


- For Skwentna River at Skwentna:
At 10:00am the stage was 41.5 feet.
Flood Stage is 42.0 feet.

Impacts:
At 41.5 feet: Water starts to flow over low spots on the road
which is adjacent to an active slough.  There are five or so
houses on this road including the Wx observers.
At 43.5 feet: Water should start to encroach some houses
located near the active slough on the east side of town.
At 45.0 feet: There would be considerable bank erosion,
including the east end of the runway.
At 48.0 feet: Elevation of runway.
- For Yentna River at Lake Creek:
At 3:00pm the stage was 20.7 feet.
Flood Stage is 20.5 feet.

Impacts:
At 20.5 feet: Anglers Inn &amp; King Point Lodges will have water
in several cabins.  (This roughly corresponds to a stage of
42.1 at SKWA2 - Skwentna.)


At 22.0 feet: McDougal's, King Point, Anglers Inn, Wilderness
Place, Lake Creek Lodge, 3-Rivers, and Cottonwood Resorts
will have water in a number of cabins with water also
encroaching the main lodge buildings.

At 24.0 feet: Major flooding all along the river except for
Bentalit and Northwood Lodges (which are actually on Fish
Creek).  There should be considerable damage to fixed and
moveable property.


- For Yentna River near Yentna Station:
At 3:00pm the stage was 21.0 feet.
