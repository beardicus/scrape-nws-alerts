* WHEN...High Surf Advisory until 6am HST Saturday. High Surf
Warning, from 6 AM Saturday to 6 AM HST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...High. Expect ocean water occasionally sweeping
across portions of beaches, very strong breaking waves, and
strong longshore and rip currents. Breaking waves may
occasionally impact harbors making navigating the harbor
channel dangerous.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...As the swell subsides Sunday night and
Monday, advisory level surf can be expected.</description>
<instruction>Large, breaking surf, significant shorebreak, and dangerous
currents make entering the water very hazardous.
Anyone entering the water could face significant injury or death.
Boaters should be aware of an increased number of surfers and
body boarders utilizing the harbor channel to access surfing
areas.</instruction>
