<headline>Flash Flood Watch issued January 07 at 2:15AM PST until January 07 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>.Decreasing rain and lowering snow levels will result in the threat
of flooding subsiding over the next 12-24 hours. It will still take
time for water to work its way down creek and river systems, though.
Please see the latest flood advisories and warnings for the most
recent flood information.
...FLASH FLOOD WATCH FOR THE EAGLE CREEK FIRE BURN AREA REMAINS IN
EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding and debris flows caused by excessive
rainfall and snowmelt are possible over the Eagle Creek Fire Burn

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A combination of snowmelt and heavy rain early this morning

<instruction>You should monitor forecasts and be prepared to take action should
Flash Flood Warnings be issued. Be prepared to evacuate on short
notice.
Local emergency services are monitoring the situation and will issue
a public statement as conditions warrant. PLAN NOW so you will know
what to do in an emergency. Keep informed by listening to local
radio and television for statements and possible warnings. Follow
the advice of public safety officials.
There have been several confirmed debris flows within the Eagle
Creek Burn Area over the past 24 hours. Large destructive debris
flows and mudflows are likely with any additional heavy rain this
morning. Debris flows are likely along streams, in canyons and below
mouths of canyons in the warned area. Debris flows could overflow
normal channels, crossing roads and impacting structures near or
below burned drainages and hillsides. If you are in a low lying area
around a stream or creek channel, or you hear rumbling sounds, move
to higher ground immediately. Do not drive across a flooded area or
into shallow debris even though it may look passable.</instruction>
