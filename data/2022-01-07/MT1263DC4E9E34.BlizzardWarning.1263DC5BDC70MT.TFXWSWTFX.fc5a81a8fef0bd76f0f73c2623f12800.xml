<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT MST TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions. Additional snow accumulations up to 7
inches, mainly toward Marias Pass and higher elevations. Winds
gusting as high as 75 mph.
* WHERE...Northern Rocky Mountain Front.
* WHEN...Until Midnight MST tonight.
* IMPACTS...Visibilities may drop below one-quarter mile due to
falling and blowing snow. Whiteout conditions are expected and

<instruction>Persons should delay all travel if possible. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution and be prepared for sudden
changes in visibility. Leave plenty of room between you and the
motorist ahead of you, and allow extra time to reach your
destination. Avoid sudden braking or acceleration, and be especially
cautious on hills or when making turns. Make sure your car is
winterized and in good working order.</instruction>
