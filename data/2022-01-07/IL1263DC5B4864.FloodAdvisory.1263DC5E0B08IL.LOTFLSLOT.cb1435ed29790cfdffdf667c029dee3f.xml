<instruction>An ice jam is likely affecting water levels in this area. River
forecasts during ice jams are less certain due to many complicated
factors. Significant river ice cover can cause large water level
fluctuations and flooding with little advanced notice. River ice may
also cause gauge observations to be inaccurate.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov/Chicago and
water.weather.gov
The next statement is expected by Saturday afternoon.</instruction>
