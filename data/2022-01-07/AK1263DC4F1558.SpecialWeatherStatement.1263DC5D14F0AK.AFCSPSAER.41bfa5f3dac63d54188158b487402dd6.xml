<description>...STRONG WINDS FRIDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH SUNDAY...
Northeast winds sustained 20 to 35 mph, with gusts up to 45 mph,
will return Friday afternoon and continue through the overnight
hours before slowly diminishing Saturday. These winds are then
expected to increase again late Saturday evening and continue
through Sunday before diminishing by Monday morning. Loose debris
may still be affected by these winds and should be secured where
possible.
Wind chills from 10 to 25 below zero are expected with higher
winds. This could cause dangerous life-threatening conditions for
those without power, as frostbite can develop in as little as as
15 minutes in these conditions.
