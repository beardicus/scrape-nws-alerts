<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 07 at 11:51PM AKST until January 09 at 6:00PM AKST by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AKST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 6 to
13 inches, with greatest amounts north of Coffman Cove. Winds
gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Petersburg, Wrangell, Kake, Point Baker, Whale Pass,
Ketchikan, Coffman Cove, Thorne Bay, Hollis, Kasaan, and
Metlakatla.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM AKST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Winds
could down trees and cause power outages. Heavy, wet snow will
be difficult to manage. Ponding could develop after a changeover
to rain. In areas of deep snow pack, additional snow and a
changeover to rain could challenge load bearing ability of roof-
tops, boats, and aircraft.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A band of snow has developed over northern
Prince of Wales Island with a report of 3 inches already at
Whale Pass. This band is expected to remain in place overnight
with snow accumulations of about 6 inches through Saturday
morning mainly for the northern half of Prince of Wales Island.
The period of heavy snow is still expected to arrive Saturday
afternoon into Saturday night. There is a chance of snow mixing
with freezing rain at times. A change to all rain is expected on
Sunday.</description>
