<description>...COMPLEX PROLONGED WINTER STORM TO BRING MULTIPLE PRECIPITATION
TYPES AND POSSIBLE BLIZZARD CONDITIONS ACROSS PORTIONS OF WESTERN
AND CENTRAL MINNESOTA TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...
.A complex storm system developing over the Rockies will shift
east into the Central Plains Tuesday, then quickly move northeast
into Minnesota Tuesday night and into Canada by Wednesday
night. Precipitation will start as snow for much of the area
Tuesday morning, transitioning to a wintry mix of freezing rain,
sleet, and snow Tuesday afternoon and Tuesday night. A transition
back to snow showers will occur Wednesday. Total snow
accumulations of 3 to 7 inches are anticipated, with the highest
amounts over far western Minnesota. In addition, strong winds will
develop Tuesday and persist through Wednesday, potentially
resulting in blizzard conditions.
A Winter Storm Watch remains in effect for portions of western
and central Minnesota west of a line from Granite Falls to
Willmar, St. Cloud, and Lake Mille Lacs. Stay tuned to the
National Weather Service for the latest forecasts and updates on
this complex winter storm.
