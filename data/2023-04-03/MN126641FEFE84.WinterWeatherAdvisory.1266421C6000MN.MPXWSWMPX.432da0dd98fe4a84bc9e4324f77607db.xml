<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued April 03 at 2:45PM CDT until April 05 at 7:00AM CDT by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...COMPLEX PROLONGED WINTER STORM TO BRING MULTIPLE PRECIPITATION
TYPES AND BLOWING SNOW ACROSS PORTIONS OF WESTERN AND CENTRAL
MINNESOTA TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...
.A strengthening weather system will impact the area beginning
Tuesday morning in western Minnesota, spreading north and
eastwards throughout the day and into Wednesday. Snow will be the
initial precipitation type, with snow eventually becoming mixed
with sleet, freezing rain, and rain depending on the area. Winds
will increase significantly later on Tuesday and into Wednesday,
resulting in significant visibility reductions and areas of
blowing snow at times, mainly in western Minnesota. Ice
accumulations coupled with strengthening winds could also result
in falling tree branches or power lines.
The Winter Storm Watch has been replaced by a Winter Storm Warning
in portions of west-central Minnesota where the combination of
falling snow, ice, sleet, and winds will produce the greatest
overall impacts to travel and infrastructure. A Winter Weather
Advisory has been issued for areas that will see more mixed
precipitation and lower overall accumulation, but will still
be impacted by the combination of mixed precipitation and winds.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM TUESDAY TO 7 AM
CDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow accumulations
of up to 3 inches and ice accumulations of a light glaze.
Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Lac Qui Parle, Swift, Chippewa, Kandiyohi and Yellow
Medicine Counties.
* WHEN...From 6 AM Tuesday to 7 AM CDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the evening commute. Strong winds could
cause extensive damage to trees and power lines.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
The latest road conditions for the state you are calling from can
be obtained by calling 5 1 1. Road conditions can also be found
at 511mn.org for Minnesota or 511wi.gov for Wisconsin.</instruction>
