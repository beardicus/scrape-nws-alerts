<headline>Rip Current Statement issued April 03 at 9:22PM AST until April 05 at 6:00PM AST by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH WEDNESDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Life-threatening rip currents due to breaking waves
around 6 to 7 feet and occasionally higher.
* WHERE...Beaches of the northern USVI.
* WHEN...Through at least Wednesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.</instruction>
