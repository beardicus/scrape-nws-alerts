<headline>Freeze Watch issued April 03 at 2:54PM MDT until April 05 at 9:00AM MDT by NWS Saltlake</headline>
<description>...FREEZE WATCH IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY EVENING THROUGH WEDNESDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Sub-freezing temperatures as low as 26 possible for the
lower elevations within Zion National Park.
* WHERE...Zion National Park.
* WHEN...From Tuesday evening through Wednesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Frost and freeze conditions could kill crops, other
sensitive vegetation and possibly damage unprotected outdoor
plumbing.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...There is about a 40% chance of temperatures
dropping below 28 degrees on Monday night into Tuesday morning,
however, overnight cloud cover will limit this potential.
Tuesday night, however, will feature cold air, clear skies, and
light winds, increasing probability of a hard freeze to about
70%.</description>
<instruction>Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
