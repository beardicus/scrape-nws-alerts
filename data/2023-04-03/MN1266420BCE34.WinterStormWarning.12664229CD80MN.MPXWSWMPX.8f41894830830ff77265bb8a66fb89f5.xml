<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued April 03 at 10:41PM CDT until April 05 at 7:00PM CDT by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...COMPLEX PROLONGED WINTER STORM TO BRING MULTIPLE PRECIPITATION
TYPES AND BLOWING SNOW ACROSS PORTIONS OF WESTERN AND CENTRAL
MINNESOTA TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...
.A strengthening weather system will impact the area beginning
Tuesday morning in western Minnesota, spreading north and
eastwards throughout the day and into Wednesday. Snow will be the
initial precipitation type, with snow eventually becoming mixed
with sleet, freezing rain, and rain depending on the area. Winds
will increase significantly later on Tuesday and into Wednesday,
resulting in significant visibility reductions and areas of
blowing snow at times, mainly in western Minnesota. Ice
accumulations coupled with strengthening winds could also result
in falling tree branches or power lines.
A Winter Storm Warning remains in effect starting at 6AM for portions
of west-central Minnesota where the combination of falling snow,
ice, sleet, and winds will produce the greatest overall impacts to
travel and infrastructure. A Winter Weather Advisory remains in
effect for areas that will see more mixed precipitation and lower
overall accumulation, but will still be impacted by the
combination of mixed precipitation and winds.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM TUESDAY TO
7 PM CDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation expected. Total snow
accumulations of 3 to 5 inches and ice accumulations of a light
glaze. Winds gusting near 45 mph.
* WHERE...Douglas, Todd and Stevens Counties.
* WHEN...From 6 AM Tuesday to 7 PM CDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Patchy blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility. Gusty winds could bring
down tree branches.</description>
