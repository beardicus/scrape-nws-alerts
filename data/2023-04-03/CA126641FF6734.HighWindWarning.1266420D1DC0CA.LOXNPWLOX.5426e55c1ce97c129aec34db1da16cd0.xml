<headline>High Wind Warning issued April 03 at 3:13PM PDT until April 04 at 5:00AM PDT by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 AM PDT TUESDAY...
...FREEZE WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM TO 8 AM PDT
TUESDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Wind Warning, northwest winds 35 to 50 mph
with damaging gusts up to 70 mph. For the Freeze Warning, sub-
freezing temperatures as low as 28 expected.
* WHERE...Western Antelope Valley Foothills, Eastern Antelope
Valley Foothills and Antelope Valley.
* WHEN...For the High Wind Warning, until 5 AM PDT Tuesday. For
the Freeze Warning, from 3 AM to 8 AM PDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Damaging winds will blow down large objects such as
trees and power lines. Power outages are expected. Travel will
be difficult, especially for high profile vehicles. Areas of
blowing dust and sand could locally reduce visibilities to one
quarter mile or less at times. Frost and freeze conditions will
kill crops and other sensitive vegetation. Extended exposure to
cold can cause hypothermia for animals and people.</description>
<instruction>People should avoid being outside in forested areas and around
trees and branches. If possible, remain in the lower levels of
your home during the windstorm, and avoid windows. Use caution if
you must drive.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. Plan for
extra time to defrost vehicle windshields.</instruction>
