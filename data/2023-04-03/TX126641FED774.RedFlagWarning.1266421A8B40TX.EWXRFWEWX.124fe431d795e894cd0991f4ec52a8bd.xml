<description>...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS EXPECTED OVER VAL VERDE COUNTY
ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON, AND MOST OF SOUTH-CENTRAL TEXAS WEDNESDAY
MORNING AND AFTERNOON...
Very dry air will filter into portions of the southern Edwards
Plateau tomorrow afternoon, with values in the single digits and
teens currently forecast. Combined with winds approaching and
exceeding 20 MPH and dry to critically dry fuels, this will lead
to critical fire weather conditions across Val Verde County on
Tuesday afternoon. A Red Flag Warning has been issued, effective
from 1-7 PM CDT.
A cold front will push in from the northwest Tuesday night and
early Wednesday morning. Very dry air will overspread the region
behind the boundary, with widespread relative humidities in the
teens and single digits forecast along and west of Interstate 35.
Combined with sustained north winds ranging from 15 to 25 MPH, and
dry to critically dry fuels, this will promote additional
critical fire weather conditions across this portion of South-
Central Texas. A Fire Weather Watch has been issued for all
counties along and west of I-35, effective from 4 AM to 4 PM CDT
Wednesday. Individuals are strongly encouraged to avoid any
activities that could inadvertently promote the ignition and
spread of wildfires on both Tuesday and Wednesday.
