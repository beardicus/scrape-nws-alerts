<headline>Blizzard Warning issued February 03 at 2:51PM EST until February 04 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Caribou</headline>
<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EST SATURDAY...
...WIND CHILL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Blizzard Warning, ground blizzard conditions. Winds
gusting as high as 50 mph. For the Wind Chill Warning, dangerously
cold wind chills. Wind chills as low as 65 below zero.
* WHERE...Northeast Aroostook and Northwest Aroostook Counties.
* WHEN...Until 7 PM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions with drifting snow.
Widespread blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. The
hazardous conditions could impact the Friday morning and evening
commutes. Isolated to scattered power outages are possible. The
dangerously cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin
in as little as 5 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...In addition to low wind chills, areas of
blowing snow could cause whiteout conditions, particularly across
open areas exposed to northwest winds. Blowing and drifting snow
could make travel very difficult. If you must travel have a winter
survival kit and if you get stranded, stay in your vehicle.</description>
<instruction>A Blizzard Warning means severe winter weather conditions are
expected or occurring. Blowing snow with strong winds and poor
visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout conditions,
making travel extremely dangerous. Do not travel. If you must
travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded,
stay with your vehicle.
The latest road conditions for Maine can be obtained by going to
newengland511.org.
A Wind Chill Warning means the combination of very cold air and the
wind will create dangerously low wind chill values. Frostbite can
occur quickly and even hypothermia or death if precautions are not
taken.</instruction>
