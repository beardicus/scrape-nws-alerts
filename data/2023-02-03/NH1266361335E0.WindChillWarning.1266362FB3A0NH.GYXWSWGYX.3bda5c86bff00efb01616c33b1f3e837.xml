<description>...DANGEROUSLY COLD WIND CHILLS CONTINUE THROUGH SATURDAY...
.Temperatures continue to fall to below zero by this afternoon and
continue falling overnight. Temperatures will not begin to rise
again until after sunrise Saturday morning. The brutal cold combined
with gusty winds will lead to widespread, dangerously cold wind
chills beginning imminently in the mountains and into the morning to
the south. The wind chills have the potentially to be once in a
generation cold tonight into early Saturday.
...WIND CHILL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM EST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Dangerously cold wind chills. Wind chills as low as 50
below zero.
* WHERE...Portions of west central and western Maine. Portions of
northern New Hampshire.
* WHEN...Until 1 AM EST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Frostbite and hypothermia are likely if precautions are
not taken. Exposed skin may become quickly frostbitten or frozen
in as little as 10 minutes. Wind chill values may fall to life
threatening levels.</description>
<instruction>Persons are urged to stay indoors until conditions improve. If you
must go outside, dress in layers. Several layers of clothes will
keep you warmer than a single heavy coat. Cover exposed skin to
reduce your risk of frostbite or hypothermia. Gloves, a scarf, and a
hat will keep you from losing your body heat.
Wrap pipes with insulation and seal windows to avoid loss of heat
from your home. Keep a slow steady stream of water running from
indoor faucets, and open cabinet doors to allow warm air to
circulate around inside pipes.
Keep pets indoors as much as possible.
Make frequent checks on older family, friends, and neighbors. Ensure
portable heaters are used correctly. Do not use generators or grills
inside.</instruction>
