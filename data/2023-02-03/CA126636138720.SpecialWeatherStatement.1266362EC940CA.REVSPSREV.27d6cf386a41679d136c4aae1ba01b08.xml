<description>...Winter storm expected to bring impacts to the region starting
Saturday night...
* A winter storm is expected to move into the Sierra Saturday
evening through Sunday. This system will bring some winter
weather impacts to western Nevada, especially in the foothills.
* Winds: South winds will shift to the southwest on Sunday.
Southwest wind gusts will generally be on the order of 30 to 40
mph, with a few wind prone areas gusting up to 55 mph.
* Precipitation: Snow levels will start out near 5000 feet in
northern Washoe County to 6500 feet in Mineral county Saturday
night. Any spillover precipitation during this time will be rain
for the valleys, with a rain/snow mix possible in the foothills.
A cold front passage early Sunday will rapidly bring snow levels
down to all valley floors through the remainder of the day.
Convective snow showers may bring quick bursts of moderate
snowfall rates and impactful roadway accumulation to portions of
western Nevada on Sunday. While overall snowfall amounts are not
expected to be significant across the area, be sure to check
roadway conditions before heading out. You can obtain the latest
information by downloading NDOT`s &quot;NVRoads&quot; application on your
smart phone or by dialing 5 1 1.</description>
