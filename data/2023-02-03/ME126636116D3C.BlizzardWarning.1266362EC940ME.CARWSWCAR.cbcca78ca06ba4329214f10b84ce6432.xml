<headline>Blizzard Warning issued February 03 at 2:59AM EST until February 04 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Caribou</headline>
<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EST SATURDAY...
...WIND CHILL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO 7 PM EST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Blizzard Warning, ground blizzard conditions.
Additional snow accumulations up to one inch. Winds gusting as
high as 50 mph. For the Wind Chill Warning, dangerously cold wind
chills expected. Wind chills as low as 60 below zero.
* WHERE...Northern Penobscot and Southeast Aroostook Counties.
* WHEN...For the Blizzard Warning, until 7 PM EST Saturday. For the
Wind Chill Warning, from Noon today to 7 PM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions with drifting snow.
Widespread blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. The
hazardous conditions could impact the Friday morning and evening
commutes. Isolated to scattered power outages are possible. The
dangerously cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin
in as little as 5 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...In addition to low wind chills, areas of
blowing snow could cause whiteout conditions, particularly across
open areas exposed to northwest winds. Blowing and drifting snow
could make travel very difficult. If you must travel have a winter
survival kit and if you get stranded, stay in your vehicle.</description>
<instruction>A Wind Chill Warning means the combination of very cold air and the
wind will create dangerously low wind chill values. Frostbite can
occur quickly and even hypothermia or death if precautions are not
taken.
Persons should consider delaying all travel. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution. Consider taking a winter
storm kit along with you, including such items as tire chains,
booster cables, flashlight, shovel, blankets and extra clothing.
Also take water, a first aid kit, and anything else that would help
you survive in case you become stranded.
Keep pets indoors as much as possible.</instruction>
