<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued February 03 at 3:23AM EST until February 04 at 4:00AM EST by NWS Buffalo</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM EST SATURDAY...
...WIND CHILL ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM EST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Winter Weather Advisory, lake effect snow.
Additional snow accumulations of 3 to 5 inches in the most
persistent lake snows. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph will
produce blowing and drifting snow. For the Wind Chill Advisory,
very cold wind chills expected. Wind chills as low as 15 to 20
below zero.
* WHERE...Monroe, Wayne, and Northern Cayuga counties. Greatest
snow accumulations expected across the northern and eastern
suburbs of Rochester and portions of Wayne and Cayuga counties.
* WHEN...For the Winter Weather Advisory, until 4 AM EST Saturday.
For the Wind Chill Advisory, until 10 AM EST Saturday. The
majority of the snow accumulations will occur late this
afternoon and this evening when lake effect snow briefly
intensifies southeast of Lake Ontario.
* IMPACTS...Plan on snow covered and slippery road conditions.
Areas of blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute. The cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed
skin in as little as 30 minutes.</description>
<instruction>Lake effect snow will fall in relatively narrow bands. If
traveling, be prepared for rapidly changing road conditions and
visibilities.
Submit snow reports through our website or social media.
This is a potentially dangerous situation to be outdoors. If you
must be outside, be sure to cover all exposed skin. Frostbite can
occur in 30 minutes or less with apparent temperatures of
15 below zero or colder.</instruction>
