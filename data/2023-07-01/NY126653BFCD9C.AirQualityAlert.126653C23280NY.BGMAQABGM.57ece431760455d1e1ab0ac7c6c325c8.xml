<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EDT TONIGHT...
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation at
Albany has issued a Air Quality Health Advisory for Ground Level
Ozone from 11 AM until 11 PM Saturday and Fine Particulates until
midnight EDT Saturday night.
Air quality levels in outdoor air are predicted to be greater than
an air quality index value of 100 for Ground Level Ozone and Fine
Particulates. The air quality index...or AQI...was created as an
easy way to correlate levels of different pollutants to one scale.
The higher the AQI value, the greater the health concern.
When pollution levels are elevated...the New York State Department
of Health recommends that individuals consider limiting strenuous
outdoor physical activity to reduce the risk of adverse health
effects. People who may be especially sensitive to the effects of
elevated levels of pollutants include the very young and those with
pre existing respiratory problems such as asthma or heart disease.
Those with symptoms should consider consulting their personal
physician.
For additional information, please visit the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation website at,

800-535-1345.</description>
