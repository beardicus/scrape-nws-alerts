<headline>Special Weather Statement issued July 01 at 2:35PM CDT  by NWS Huntsville</headline>
<description>...SIGNIFICANT WEATHER ADVISORY FOR WEST CENTRAL CULLMAN COUNTY UNTIL
315 PM CDT...
At 235 PM CDT, Doppler radar was tracking a strong thunderstorm 7
miles southeast of Helicon, or 10 miles east of Arley, moving east at
15 mph.
Pea size hail and winds in excess of 40 mph will be possible with
this storm.
Locations impacted include...
Cullman, Good Hope, Dodge City, Logan, Bremen, Crane Hill and Smith
Lake.</description>
<instruction>Very heavy rainfall is also occurring with this storm, and may lead
to localized flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flooded
roadways.
Frequent cloud to ground lightning is occurring with this storm.
Lightning can strike several miles away from a thunderstorm. Seek a
safe shelter inside a building or vehicle.
If on or near Smith Lake, get out of the water and move indoors or
inside a vehicle. Remember, gusty winds can sink boats. Also,
lightning can strike out to 10 miles from the parent thunderstorm.
If you can hear thunder, you are close enough to be struck by
lightning. Move to safe shelter now! Do not be caught on the water
in a thunderstorm.</instruction>
