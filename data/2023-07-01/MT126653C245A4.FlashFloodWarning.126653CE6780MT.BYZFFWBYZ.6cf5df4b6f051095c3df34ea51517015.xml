Dilworth Creek.

and other loose materials.

FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Life threatening flooding of creeks, roads, and normally dry coulees
in and downstream of the Robertson Draw Burn Area burn area is
likely. In addition to the flash flooding, the heavy rains may
trigger rockslides, mudslides, and debris flows in steep terrain.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles. Do not drive on or attempt to cross
flooded roads, find an alternate route. Roads and driveways may be
damaged or washed out in places.
Remain alert for flooding of creeks, streams, and normally dry
coulees even in areas not receiving rainfall downstream of the burn
area. These can become raging killer currents in a matter of minutes
even from distant rainfall upstream.</instruction>
