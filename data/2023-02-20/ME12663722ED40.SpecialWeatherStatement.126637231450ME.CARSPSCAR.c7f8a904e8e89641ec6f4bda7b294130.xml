<description>...An area of heavy snow showers will affect east central
Piscataquis...eastern Aroostook and north central Penobscot
Counties...
At 659 PM EST...An area of heavy snow showers was along a line
extending from Madawaska to near Portage Lake to Baxter State Park...
and moving east AT 30 MPH.
Locations impacted include...
Presque Isle, Caribou, Madawaska, Fort Fairfield, Limestone, Van
Buren, Patten, Portage, Mapleton, Washburn, Mars Hill, Ashland,
Easton, Woodland, Sherman, Island Falls, Smyrna, Portage Lake,
Masardis and Mount Chase.
This includes the following highways...

* Winds in excess of 30 mph are possible with this area of heavy
snow showers.
* Visibilities will drop quickly to less than a half mile in this
area of heavy snow showers.
Travel is not advised during these heavy snow showers. Rapid
visibility reduction and potentially icy roads are likely to lead to

location. If traveling pull off to a safe location.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time when traveling.</description>
