<description>...WIDESPREAD HEAVY SNOW AND DANGEROUSLY COLD TEMPERATURES
EXPECTED...
.Late tonight into early tomorrow, the first of two rounds of
snow is expected to impact the area, primarily affecting far
northwestern South Dakota and higher elevations of the northern of
central Black Hills. More widespread heavy snow arrives late
Tuesday into Wednesday, with several inches of snow expected area-
wide. The combination of heavy snow and breezy winds will lead to
dangerous or impossible travel conditions across northeastern
Wyoming and western South Dakota through early Thursday.
Dangerously cold Arctic air will accompany the snow, with wind
chills as low as 30 to 40 below zero expected across the area
Wednesday morning through at least Thursday.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 5 PM TUESDAY TO
11 AM MST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 8 to
12 inches. Locally heavier amounts possible, especially in the
northern and eastern foothills. Winds gusting as high as 50
mph.
* WHERE...Portions of northwestern, southwestern and the Black
Hills of South Dakota and northeast Wyoming. This includes the
Tribal Lands of the Cheyenne River Reservation and the Pine
Ridge Reservation.
* WHEN...From 5 PM Tuesday to 11 AM MST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. Gusty winds could
bring down tree branches. Dangerously cold wind chills as low
as 35 below zero could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as
little as 10 minutes beginning Wednesday morning.</description>
