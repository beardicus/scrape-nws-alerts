<headline>High Surf Advisory issued February 20 at 12:03PM PST until February 22 at 3:00PM PST by NWS Eureka</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM TO 3 PM PST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Large breaking waves around 18 to 22 feet.
* WHERE...Mendocino County Coast.
* WHEN...From 4 AM to 3 PM PST Wednesday.. .
* IMPACTS...Dangerous surfing conditions and localized beach
erosion. Beachcombing is highly discouraged!.</description>
<instruction>Large breaking waves along the coast will lead to increased wave
run-up on beaches with waves topping and washing over large rocks
and jetties. These large waves can be erratic and unpredictable.
Use extra caution near the surf zone as these large waves will be
capable of sweeping people into the frigid and turbulent ocean
water. Mariners traversing the bar are urged to exercise extreme
caution or stay in port until the threat subsides. Please contact
the U.S. Coast Guard for information regarding harbor and bar
closures.</instruction>
