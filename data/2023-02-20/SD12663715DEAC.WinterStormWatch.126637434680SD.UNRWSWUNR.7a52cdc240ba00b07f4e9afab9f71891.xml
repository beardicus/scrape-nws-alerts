<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued February 20 at 7:43AM MST until February 23 at 5:00AM MST by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>...WIDESPREAD HEAVY SNOW AND VERY COLD TEMPERATURES LIKELY...
.Ongoing snow will lead to some travel difficulties across
northeastern Wyoming and the northern Black Hills this morning
through this afternoon. Beginning late tonight, a winter storm
will impact the region through the middle of the week, likely
bringing heavy snow to all of northeast Wyoming and western South
Dakota. Total snow amounts of 6 to 12 inches are possible, with
the potential for locally heavier amounts. Blowing and drifting
snow will also be possible in open areas. In addition, an Arctic
airmass will settle into the region Wednesday, with dangerous wind
chills likely through early Friday.
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY EVENING
THROUGH LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 10 to
14 inches possible. Winds could gust as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Bennett County, Mellette County, Todd County and Tripp
County. This includes the Tribal Lands of the Rosebud
Reservation.
* WHEN...From Tuesday evening through late Wednesday night.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible.
Widespread blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility.
The dangerously cold wind chills as low as 35 below zero could
cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Watch means heavy snow, strong winds, freezing
precipitation, and cold temperatures are possible. Monitor NOAA
weather radio, local radio or television, or the Internet for
updates on this potentially dangerous storm. Take time to
prepare for severe winter conditions before the storm develops.</instruction>
