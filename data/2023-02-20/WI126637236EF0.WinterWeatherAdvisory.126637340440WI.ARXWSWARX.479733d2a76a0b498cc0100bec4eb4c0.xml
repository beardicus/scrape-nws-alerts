<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued February 20 at 9:32PM CST until February 22 at 6:00AM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Multi-Faceted Winter Storm From Tuesday Evening Through
Thursday...
.A complex and highly impactful winter storm is shaping up for
late Tuesday afternoon through Thursday. The heaviest snow
arrives in two waves: first focusing on Tuesday night along an
axis between Interstates 90 and 94 with amounts of 3 to 5 inches.
A Winter Weather Advisory has been issued for this time for
counties in southeastern Minnesota and western into central
Wisconsin. While the snow tapers off during the morning on
Wednesday, the combination of ongoing light snow showers and
increasing northeasterly winds may result in travel impacts due to
blowing and drifting snow. Although, given the expected temporary
lull in precipitation, headlines are expected to temporarily
expire Wednesday morning.
The second wave of snow arrives Wednesday afternoon with the
potential to produce another 10 inches of snow over the watch area
in southeast Minnesota and western into central Wisconsin. Strong
winds in these areas will continue to result in blowing and
drifting snow. The watch area from northeast Iowa into far
southwest Wisconsin exhibits the potential to receive up to 6
inches of snowfall accumulations as well as a quarter inch of ice
accumulations through Thursday.
This looks to be a HIGHLY impactful winter storm with many
facets. Travel could be severely impacted at times. With some
adjustments in the storm track possible, along with uncertainties
in where the heavier snow bands and favored wintry mix areas lie
along the southern border of the storm track, expect refinements
to the forecast over the next couple days.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 3 PM TUESDAY TO 6 AM
CST WEDNESDAY...
...WINTER STORM WATCH NOW IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...For the Winter Weather Advisory, snow expected. Snow
accumulations of 1 to 3 inches possible Tuesday afternoon and

* WHERE...Portions of southeast Minnesota and west central
Wisconsin.
* WHEN...For the Winter Weather Advisory, from 3 PM Tuesday to 6
AM CST Wednesday. For the Winter Storm Watch, from Wednesday
afternoon through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Patchy
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. The
