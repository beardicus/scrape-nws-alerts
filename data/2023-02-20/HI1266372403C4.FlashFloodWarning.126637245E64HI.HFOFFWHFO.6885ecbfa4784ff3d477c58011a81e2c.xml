<description>The National Weather Service in Honolulu has issued a

The island of Kauai in Kauai County
* Until 1145 PM HST.
* At 913 PM HST, radar showed persistent bands of heavy rainfall
moving over Kauai from the southeast with rates of 1 to 2 inches
per hour. Water levels have begun to rise in the streams across
much of the island, especially in the South Fork Wailua and
Hanalei Rivers. Runoff impacting vulnerable low lying areas and
roads is likely through the late evening hours.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by heavy rain.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flooding in drainages, streams, rivers, roads,
properties, and other low-lying areas. Public road
closures possible in some areas. Landslides are
possible in steep terrain.

persists.
This Flash Flood Warning replaces the previously issued Flood
Advisory that was in effect for The island of Kauai in Kauai County.
