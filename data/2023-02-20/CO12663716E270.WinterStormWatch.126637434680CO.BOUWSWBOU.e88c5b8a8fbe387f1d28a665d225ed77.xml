.A system will bring potentially heavy snowfall across the Front
Range starting in the higher elevations Tuesday. Snow begins in the
foothills and northern I-25 corridor starting late Tuesday night.
The heaviest snowfall will occur in Park Range and the Larimer
county foothills. This will likely lead to periods of poor
visibility and difficult travel conditions especially in the
Colorado high country.

THURSDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations between 8 and
16 inches possible. Winds could gust as high as 65 mph.
* WHERE...Rocky Mountain National Park and the Medicine Bow Range.
* WHEN...From 11 AM Tuesday morning through 5 AM Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Visibilities may drop below 1/4 mile due to falling and
blowing snow. Snow covered roads will make travel hazardous.
Travel could be very difficult to impossible.</description>
<instruction>Monitor the latest forecasts for updates on this situation.

extra time to reach your destination.</instruction>
