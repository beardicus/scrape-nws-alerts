<description>...COLD, WIND, AND SNOW RETURN STARTING TUESDAY...
* WINDS: Strong winds will accompany a cold front on Tuesday. Wind
gusts of 40-55 mph are expected along the front, with possible
stronger gusts surpassing 65 mph in wind prone areas. Wind gusts
exceeding 100 mph are expected along the Sierra crest. This will
bring impacts for both air and ground travel, choppy lakes and
areas of blowing dust across the west central Nevada Basin and
Range. Breezy winds will continue Wednesday and Thursday, but
won`t be nearly as strong as Tuesday.
* SNOW: An initial round of snow is expected Tuesday and Tuesday
night, with a short burst of higher snowfall rates and even a
rumble of thunder possible with the front. Additional periods of
snow showers will follow through Thursday night, favoring the
Sierra, though there is a 25% chance for a snow shower in any
given location. Snow amounts will be highly variable over short
distances due to the showery nature. A third round of snow is
looking likely Friday into Saturday, with the main focus in the
Eastern Sierra, but potential as far north as I-80.
* COLD TEMPERATURES: High temperatures Wednesday through Friday
will struggle to get out of the 30s in even the warmest valleys,
with teens and 20s in the mountains. Overnight lows will dip in
the teens and single digits, with below zero in colder valleys.
Brisk winds will make it feel even colder, with dangerous wind
chills in exposed areas of the high Sierra dipping as low as -30
degrees. Be sure to protect vulnerable populations as well as
pets.</description>
