EXPECTED...
.Late tonight into early tomorrow, the first of two rounds of
snow is expected to impact the area, primarily affecting far
northwestern South Dakota and higher elevations of the northern of
central Black Hills. More widespread heavy snow arrives late
Tuesday into Wednesday, with several inches of snow expected area-

dangerous or impossible travel conditions across northeastern

Dangerously cold Arctic air will accompany the snow, with wind
chills as low as 30 to 40 below zero expected across the area
Wednesday morning through at least Thursday.

10 inches. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Harding County and Perkins County.
* WHEN...From midnight tonight to 11 AM MST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. Dangerously cold
wind chills as low as 35 below zero could cause frostbite on
exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes beginning Wednesday
morning.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...After a period of snow from late tonight
through Tuesday morning, a break in snow is anticipated.
Heavier snow should then return Wednesday morning. Blowing
snow may cause hazardous travel during the break in snowfall.</description>
