<description>...WIDESPREAD HEAVY SNOW POSSIBLE ALONG WITH VERY COLD
TEMPERATURES...
.A winter storm will impact the region the middle of this week,
likely bringing heavy snow to all of northeast Wyoming and
western South Dakota Tuesday night through Wednesday night. Total
snow amounts of 6 to 12 inches are possible, with the potential
for locally higher amounts over a foot in some areas. Blowing and
drifting snow will also be possible in open areas. In addition,
an arctic airmass will settle into the region Wednesday, with
dangerous wind chills likely through much of Thursday. Listen to
NOAA Weather Radio or your local media for the latest updates on
this storm.
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 6 to
12 inches possible. Winds could gust as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of northwestern, southwestern and the Black
Hills of South Dakota and northeast and the Black Hills of
Wyoming. This includes the Tribal Lands of the Cheyenne River
Reservation and the Pine Ridge Reservation.
* WHEN...From Tuesday afternoon through late Wednesday night.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. Gusty winds could
bring down tree branches. The dangerously cold wind chills as
