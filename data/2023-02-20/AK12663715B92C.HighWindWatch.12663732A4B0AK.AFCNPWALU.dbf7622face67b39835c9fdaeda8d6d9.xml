<headline>High Wind Watch issued February 20 at 4:47AM AKST until February 21 at 6:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Southwest winds 45 to 55 mph with gusts up to 75 mph
possible.
* WHERE...Pribilof Islands.
* WHEN...From late tonight through Tuesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...High winds could move loose debris, damage property,
and cause power outages. Travel could be difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A rapidly approaching North Pacific low
pressure system will enter the Bering today. This system is
expected to produce high winds along the Central Aleutians
tonight into Tuesday morning. Confidence is growing that this
core of elevated winds will persist as the low advances
northward toward the Pribilofs Tuesday morning. Wind direction
is currently expected to be southwest. This wind flow appears
favorable to produce waves up to 25 feet near St. Paul harbor.</description>
<instruction>A high wind watch means there is potential for a hazardous high
wind event. Monitor the latest forecasts and warnings for updates
on this situation. Fasten loose objects or shelter objects in a
safe location prior to the onset of winds.</instruction>
