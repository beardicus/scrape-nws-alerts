<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued February 20 at 10:28PM HST until February 20 at 11:45PM HST by NWS Honolulu</headline>
<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1145 PM HST THIS
EVENING FOR THE ISLAND OF KAUAI IN KAUAI COUNTY...
At 1028 PM HST, radar showed that moderate to heavy rainfall was
still moving over Kauai from the southeast with rainfall rates of 1
to 2 inches per hour. The Hanalei River water level continues to
rise, which will likely inundate Kuhio Highway near the Hanalei
Bridge over the next hour or two. South Fork Wailua River was also
running at a high level. Additional rainfall expected will keep
streams and rivers over Kauai at high flow levels.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by heavy rain.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flooding in drainages, streams, rivers, roads,
properties, and other low-lying areas. Public road
closures possible in some areas. Landslides are possible
in steep terrain.
This includes the entire island of Kauai.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Stay away from streams, rivers, drainage ditches, and culverts, even
if they are currently dry.
Do not cross fast flowing or rising water in your vehicle, or on
foot. Turn around, don`t drown.</instruction>
