<headline>High Wind Warning issued February 20 at 3:54PM AKST until February 21 at 6:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM TO 6 PM AKST TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Southwest winds 45 to 55 mph with gusts up to 75 mph
expected.
* WHERE...Pribilof Islands.
* WHEN...From 3 AM to 6 PM AKST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...High winds could move loose debris, damage property,
and cause power outages. Travel could be difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A rapidly approaching North Pacific low
pressure system will enter the Bering today. Confidence is
growing that the core of elevated winds will persist as the low
advances northward toward the Pribilof Islands Tuesday morning.
Wind direction is currently expected to be southwest. This wind
flow appears favorable to produce waves up to 25 feet near St.
Paul harbor. Conditions are expected to improve by late Tuesday
afternoon as the low lifts northward.</description>
<instruction>People are urged to secure loose objects that could be blown
around or damaged by the wind. Prepare for the possibility of
widespread power outages. Use caution if you must drive.</instruction>
