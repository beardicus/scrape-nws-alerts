- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Calvert and St. Marys
* STORM INFORMATION:

SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Ophelia will move north-northwest toward the North
Carolina coast tonight before moving northward across the Mid- Atlantic
Saturday through Sunday.
Storm surge is expected to be the main threat to our area, especially
along the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay and the tidal Potomac
River where inundation of 1 to 3 feet is expected. In particular, St.
Mary`s County could see significant impacts from surge where 2 to
3 feet of inundation is likely. The highest water levels will be
around high tides Saturday afternoon through early Sunday morning.
Widespread rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches are expected, with
localized amounts up to 5 inches possible. This may result in isolated
instances of flooding, especially for low-lying and flood prone areas.
The heaviest rain is most likely to occur Saturday into Saturday
night.
Tropical storm force wind gusts, likely between 50 and 60 mph, are
expected over southern Maryland and the nearby waters south of North
Beach MD along the Chesapeake Bay, and southeast of Cobb Island MD
along the tidal Potomac River. Winds are expected to begin increasing
late tonight, with the strongest winds from Saturday morning through
Saturday evening. Gusty winds and a saturated ground will likely cause
downed trees and power outages, especially along the immediate western
shoreline of the Chesapeake Bay.
While the severe weather threat is low, a brief tornado or two cannot
out be ruled out across southern Maryland Saturday afternoon and
evening.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay and tidal
Potomac River. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread
with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where
surge water covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible
significant impacts east of Interstate 95. Potential impacts include:
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals,
arroyos, and ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
Protect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across portions of southern Maryland.
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
southern Maryland. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts
across far southern Maryland. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned, large
tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees knocked
over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats pulled
from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
WATCH/WARNING PHASE - Listen to local official for recommended
preparedness actions, including possible evacuation. If ordered to
evacuate, do so immediately.
WATCH/WARNING PHASE - For those not under evacuation orders, assess
the risk from wind, falling trees, and flooding at your location. If
you decide to move, relocate to a safer location nearby. If you do
not relocate, help keep roadways open for those under evacuation
orders.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Keep your cell phone charged and in power-saving mode. If you lose
power, use it sparingly and mainly for personal emergencies and check-
ins.
