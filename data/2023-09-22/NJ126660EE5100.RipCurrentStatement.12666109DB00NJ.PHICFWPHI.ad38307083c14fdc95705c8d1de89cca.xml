<headline>Rip Current Statement issued September 22 at 3:52PM EDT until September 23 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Philadelphia - Mount Holly</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY
EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM TO 8 PM EDT
SATURDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON TO 8 PM EDT
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of up to 8 feet
are expected in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Warning,
one to three feet of inundation above ground level expected in
low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...Tidal areas in the New Jersey counties of Cape May,
Atlantic and Ocean.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Saturday evening.
For the High Surf Advisory, from 6:00 AM until 8:00 PM
Saturday. For the Coastal Flood Warning, from noon until 8:00 PM
Saturday.
* IMPACTS...At this level, widespread roadway flooding occurs in
coastal and bayside communities and along inland tidal
waterways. Many roads become impassable. Some damage to
vulnerable structures may begin to occur. Dangerous swimming and
surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip currents
can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore and into deeper
water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...With the long duration of onshore winds
expected, the back bays may struggle to drain during low tides.
This could result in minor to moderate coastal flooding
lingering after high tide. Additionally, minor flooding is
possible again with the Sunday afternoon high tide.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
