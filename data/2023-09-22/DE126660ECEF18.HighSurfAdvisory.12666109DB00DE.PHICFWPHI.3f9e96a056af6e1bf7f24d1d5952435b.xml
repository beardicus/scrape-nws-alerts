<headline>High Surf Advisory issued September 22 at 6:46AM EDT until September 23 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Philadelphia - Mount Holly</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY
EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM TO 8 PM EDT SATURDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON TO 8 PM EDT
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of up to 9 feet
expected in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Warning, two to
three feet of inundation above ground level expected in low-
lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...Delaware Beaches.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Saturday
evening. For the High Surf Advisory, from 6 AM to 8 PM EDT
Saturday. For the Coastal Flood Warning, from noon to 8 PM EDT
Saturday.
* IMPACTS...At this level, flooding may become severe enough to
cause structural damage along with widespread roadway flooding
in coastal and bayside communities, and near inland tidal
waterways. Some locations may become isolated by the flood
waters. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...With the long duration of onshore winds
expected, the back bays may struggle to drain during low
tides. This could result in minor to moderate coastal flooding
lingering after high tide. Additionally, minor flooding is
possible again with the Sunday afternoon high tide.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
