SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Ophelia off the Southeast U.S. coast will move
northward through Saturday, forecasted to make landfall west of Cape
Lookout North Carolina late tonight into early Saturday.
The primary hazards across southeast North Carolina and northeast
South Carolina are expected to be:
- Marine/Surf - hazardous marine and surf conditions along the
entire coast of northeast South Carolina and southeast North
Carolina
- Heavy Rain - heavy downpours could cause localized minor flooding
of roads and low-lying areas, mainly across eastern portions of
southeast North Carolina
- Winds - tropical storm force winds, especially in gusts, are
likely, especially along the coast north of Cape Fear
- Coastal Flooding - minor coastal flooding possible, especially
north of Cape Fear through the overnight high tide
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
eastern parts of Pender and New Hanover counties. Remain well guarded
against life-threatening flood waters having possible extensive
impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Major flooding from rainfall may prompt evacuations and
numerous rescues.
- Rivers and streams may rapidly overflow their banks in multiple
places. Creeks and ditches will flood and may contain strong
currents.
- Flood waters may enter many structures, and some may become
uninhabitable. Some road scours or complete road failures will
be possible, along with the potential for sinkholes. Many
streets and parking lots may flood, and may be impacted by
flowing water. Many road and low-lying bridge closures are
possible with some weakened or washed away. Driving conditions
will be dangerous.
- The delivery of drinking water and sewer services may be
interrupted. Flood waters may be polluted and contain hazardous
materials.
Remain well guarded against dangerous flood waters having possible limited
to significant impacts across portions of southeast North Carolina, around
Elizabethtown, Lake Waccamaw, Shallotte and Wilmington.
Elsewhere across southeast North Carolina and northeast South
Carolina, little to no impact is anticipated.
* WIND:
Protect against dangerous wind having possible significant impacts
across southeast North Carolina and northeast South Carolina.
Potential impacts in this area include:
- Some damage to porches and awnings, carports, sheds, and mobile
homes is possible. Unsecured lightweight objects may be blown
about.
- Some large limbs may break from trees. A few shallow rooted or
weak trees may snap or be knocked down. Some fences and roadway
signs damaged.
- A few roads may become impassable due to debris, particularly
within urban or heavily wooded locations. Hazardous driving
conditions are possible, especially for high profile vehicles
on bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages are possible.
* SURGE:
Protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across coastal southeast North Carolina, particularly north
of Cape Fear. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Localized inundation and minor over-wash is possible, mainly
along immediate shorelines and other vulnerable low-lying areas
along the coast. Low spots along waterways and tidal creeks may
also be impacted.
- Navigation may be difficult near inlets and waterways, as
navigational aids may be off station or missing.
- Minor beach erosion possible.
Elsewhere across southeast North Carolina and northeast South
Carolina, little to no impact is anticipated.
* TORNADOES:
Potential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across northeastern
Pender County. Remain well braced against a tornado event having possible
limited impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Tornadoes can cause damage to trees, vehicles, boats, and
buildings. Unsecured mobile homes and poorly constructed
structures are particularly vulnerable.
Elsewhere across southeast North Carolina and northeast South
Carolina, little to no impact is anticipated.
* OTHER COASTAL HAZARDS:
Hazardous surf conditions, including life-threatening rip currents, are
expected through Saturday along the entire southeast North Carolina and
northeast South Carolina coasts.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to remain safely sheltered from the storm. Stay
inside and away from windows. Listen for updates and be ready in case
you lose electrical power. Locate your battery powered radio and
flashlight from your Emergency Supplies Kit. Keep these items close.
During the peak of the storm, keep your shoes on and rain gear handy.
Boots and tennis shoes offer the best foot protection if you become
unexpectedly exposed to the elements.
Continue to keep your cell phone well charged for as long as
possible. If you lose power, use it more sparingly and mainly for
personal emergencies and check-ins. Do not overload communications
systems with idle chatter.
