<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY
EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM TO 8 PM EDT
SATURDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON TO 8 PM EDT
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of up to 9 feet
are expected in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Warning,
two to three feet of inundation above ground level expected in
low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...Tidal areas in Sussex County, Delaware.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Saturday evening.
For the High Surf Advisory, from 6:00 AM until 8:00 PM
Saturday. For the Coastal Flood Warning, from noon until 8:00 PM
Saturday.
* IMPACTS...At this level, flooding may become severe enough to
cause structural damage along with widespread roadway flooding
in coastal and bayside communities, and near inland tidal
waterways. Some locations may become isolated by the flood
waters. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized
beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers
away from shore and into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...With the long duration of onshore winds
expected, the back bays may struggle to drain during low tide.
This could result in minor to moderate coastal flooding
lingering after high tide. Additionally, minor flooding is
possible again with the Sunday afternoon high tide.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
