<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued September 22 at 1:56PM EDT until September 23 at 7:00PM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM SATURDAY TO 11 AM
EDT SUNDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM TO 7 PM EDT
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 6 to 10 ft
expected in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to
1 1/2 ft of inundation above ground level expected in
vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...Southern Queens and Southern Nassau Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Sunday evening.
For the High Surf Advisory, from 6 AM Saturday to 11 AM EDT
Sunday. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 1 PM to 7 PM EDT
Saturday.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Minor flooding is expected in vulnerable
locations near the waterfront and shoreline. As much as 1 1/2 ft
of inundation above ground level, which will cause shallow
flooding on some roads and low lying property including parking
lots, parks, lawns and homes/businesses with basements near the
waterfront.
* BEACH EROSION AND FLOODING IMPACTS...Large breaking waves of 6
to 10 ft will cause beach flooding and erosion, with scattered
areas of dune erosion during the time of high tide. The
potential for localized overwashes is low at this time,
relegated to the most compromised dune areas.
* SWIMMING IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing
conditions and localized beach erosion. Life- threatening rip
currents are likely for all people entering the surf zone.
Anyone visiting the beaches should stay out of the surf. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Additional rounds of minor coastal flooding
are possible Sunday into early next week, particularly during
the afternoon high tide.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
