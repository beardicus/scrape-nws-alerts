your area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or
needlessly risk lives.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant
- Severe storm surge flooding will likely cause inundation of
numerous roads and buildings, resulting in a threat to life
and property. Flooding will likely extend inland from the
waterfront and shoreline flooding homes, businesses and
isolating some neighborhoods. Large breaking waves will
result in additional damage near the shoreline.
- Numerous roads flooded or washed out.
