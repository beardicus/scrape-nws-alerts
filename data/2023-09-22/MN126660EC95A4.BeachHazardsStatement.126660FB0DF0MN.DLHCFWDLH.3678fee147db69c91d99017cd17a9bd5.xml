<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued September 22 at 3:17AM CDT until September 22 at 10:00PM CDT by NWS Duluth</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM CDT THIS AFTERNOON
THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Dangerous swimming conditions are expected along the
Lake Superior shoreline due to high wave action and strong rip
currents.
* WHERE...Minnesota Park Point and Wisconsin Point Beaches.
* WHEN...From 2 PM CDT this afternoon through this evening.
* IMPACTS...High wave action can make swimming difficult on days
such as this. Incoming waves in rapid succession can tire even
an experienced swimmer quickly. Rip currents can usher you away
from land. To avoid being swept away, swim parallel to the shore
to exit a rip current.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Light winds this morning are expected to
become northeast and increase this afternoon. Waves up to 3 to 5
feet will be possible this afternoon and evening.</description>
<instruction>Remain out of the water to avoid hazardous swimming conditions.</instruction>
