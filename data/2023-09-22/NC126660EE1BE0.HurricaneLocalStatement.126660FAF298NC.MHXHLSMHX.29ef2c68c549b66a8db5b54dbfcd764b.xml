SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Ophelia will continue to strengthen as it moves toward
eastern North Carolina this afternoon and tonight. Regardless of
development, moderate to locally significant impacts will occur across
eastern North Carolina, with the greatest impacts along the coast.
Life threatening storm surge, inundation 2 to 5 ft above ground level,
is possible across all coastal areas today into the weekend. The most
extensive impacts are expected to be along the lower Pamlico and Neuse
Rivers, with at least minor overwash also possible along the Outer
Banks. There is also the potential for rapid water level rises for
soundside Outer Banks late Saturday and Saturday night when the winds
shift.
Tropical storm force winds will continue through Saturday, bringing
scattered tree damage and power outages mainly along and east of Hwy 17.
Heavy rain will bring widespread rainfall amounts of 3 to 5 inches,
with isolated amounts up to 7 inches possible, bringing the threat of
localized flash flooding especially in low-lying, urban, and poor
drainage areas.
A few tornadoes could produce locally significant damage, mainly east
of Hwy 17 late today into early Saturday.
Dangerous marine conditions are expected for all coastal waters, the
sounds and rivers, with strong winds and dangerous seas building to
create treacherous conditions for mariners. Localized ocean overwash
is expected along the coast due to high surf. Stronger and more
frequent rip currents will also exist along area beaches through the
weekend.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are beginning across
coastal eastern North Carolina north of Surf City. Highest potential
for significant impacts will be up and along the Neuse and Pamlico
Rivers as well as soundside across the Outer Banks. Remain well away
from life-threatening surge having possible significant impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
Elsewhere across Eastern North Carolina, little to no impact is
anticipated.
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
Eastern North Carolina. Remain well sheltered from dangerous wind
having possible significant impacts. If realized, these impacts
include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are unfolding across eastern
North Carolina. Remain well guarded against life-threatening flood
waters having possible extensive impacts. If realized, these impacts
include:
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may
become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and barriers may
become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.
Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with
underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.
Many road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
* TORNADOES:
Localized impacts from tornadoes are possible across eastern North
Carolina. Remain well braced against a dangerous tornado event having
possible significant impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- The occurrence of scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- Several places may experience tornado damage with a few spots
of considerable damage, power loss, and communications failures.
- Locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses, mobile
homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees snapped or
uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed about.
Dangerous projectiles can add to the toll.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
WATCH/WARNING PHASE - Listen to local official for recommended
preparedness actions, including possible evacuation. If ordered to
evacuate, do so immediately.
WATCH/WARNING PHASE - For those not under evacuation orders, assess
the risk from wind, falling trees, and flooding at your location. If
you decide to move, relocate to a safer location nearby. If you do
not relocate, help keep roadways open for those under evacuation
orders.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to stay inside and away from windows. Listen for
updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Keep a
battery-powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.
Do not be a thrill seeker or risk your life for senseless photos or
videos.
If you are prone to flooding or in an area under a storm surge watch
or warning, be prepared for the possibility of a quick and dramatic
rise in water levels.
If a tornado warning is issued for your area, quickly move to the
safest place within your shelter. Protect your head and body.
