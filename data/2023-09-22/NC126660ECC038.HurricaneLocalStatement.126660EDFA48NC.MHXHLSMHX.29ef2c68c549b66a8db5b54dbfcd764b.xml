SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Potential Tropical Cyclone 16, currently east of the Georgia-South
Carolina coast, will continue to strengthen as it moves toward
eastern North Carolina today and tonight. Regardless of development,
moderate to locally significant impacts will occur across eastern
North Carolina, with the greatest impacts along the coast.
Life threatening storm surge, inundation 2 to 5 ft above ground
level, is possible across all coastal areas today into the weekend.
The most extensive impacts are expected to be along the lower
Pamlico and Neuse Rivers, with at least minor overwash also possible
along the Outer Banks. There is also the potential for rapid water
level rises for soundside Outer Banks late Saturday and Saturday
night when the winds shift.
Tropical storm force winds could start impacting portions of eastern
North Carolina this morning with strong winds continuing through
Saturday, potentially bringing scattered tree damage and power
outages mainly along and east of Hwy 17.
Heavy rain will bring widespread rainfall amounts of 3 to 5 inches,
with isolated amounts up to 7 inches possible, bringing the threat
of localized flash flooding especially in low-lying, urban, and poor
drainage areas.
A few tornadoes could produce locally significant damage, mainly
east of Highway 17 late today into early Saturday.
Dangerous marine conditions are expected for all coastal waters, the
sounds and rivers, with strong winds and dangerous seas building to
create treacherous conditions for mariners. Localized ocean overwash
is expected along the coast due to high surf. Stronger and more
frequent rip currents will also exist along area beaches through the
weekend.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Protect against life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across all of eastern North Carolina north of Surf City.
Potential impacts in this area include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
Elsewhere across Eastern North Carolina, little to no impact is
anticipated.
* WIND:
Protect against dangerous wind having possible significant impacts
across areas east of Highway 17 and the Outer Banks. Potential impacts in this area
include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
Also, protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts
across areas along and west of Highway 17.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across areas along and east of Highway 17. Potential
impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may
become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and barriers may
become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.
Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with
underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.
Many road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible
significant impacts across areas along and west of Highway 17.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a dangerous tornado event having possible significant
impacts across areas along and east of Highway 17. Potential impacts
include:
- The occurrence of scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- Several places may experience tornado damage with a few spots
of considerable damage, power loss, and communications failures.
- Locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses, mobile
homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees snapped or
uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed about.
Dangerous projectiles can add to the toll.
Protect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts
across areas west of Highway 17.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
For those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,
falling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move,
relocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help
keep roadways open for those under evacuation orders.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
Keep cell phones well charged. Cell phone chargers for automobiles
can be helpful, but be aware of your risk for deadly carbon monoxide
poisoning if your car is left idling in a garage or other poorly
ventilated area.
If you are a visitor, be sure to know the name of the city or town in
which you are staying and the name of the county or parish in which
it resides. Listen for these locations in local news updates. Pay
attention for instructions from local authorities.
Storm surge is the leading killer associated with tropical storms and
hurricanes! Make sure you are in a safe area away from the surge
zone. Even if you are not in a surge-prone area, you could find
yourself cutoff by flood waters during and after the storm. Heed
evacuation orders issued by the local authorities.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
