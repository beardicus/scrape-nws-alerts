<headline>High Surf Advisory issued September 22 at 1:56PM EDT until September 24 at 11:00AM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM SATURDAY TO 11 AM
EDT SUNDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 6 to 10 feet
expected in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Statement, up
to one foot of inundation above ground level expected in
vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...Southwest Suffolk and Southeast Suffolk Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Sunday evening.
For the High Surf Advisory, from 6 AM Saturday to 11 AM EDT
Sunday. For the Coastal Flood Statement, from Saturday
afternoon through Saturday evening.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Brief minor flooding of the most
vulnerable locations near the waterfront and shoreline during
the time of high tide.
* BEACH EROSION AND FLOODING IMPACTS...Large breaking waves of 6
to 10 ft will cause beach flooding and erosion, with scattered
areas of dune erosion during the time of high tide. The
potential for localized overwashes is low at this time,
relegated to the most compromised dune areas.
* SWIMMING IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Life- threatening rip currents are
likely for all people entering the surf zone. Anyone visiting
the beaches should stay out of the surf. Rip currents can sweep
even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>Do not drive through flooded roadways.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
