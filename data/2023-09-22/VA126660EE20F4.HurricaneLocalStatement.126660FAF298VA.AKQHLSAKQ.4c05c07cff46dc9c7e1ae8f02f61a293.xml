SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Ophelia continues to strengthen off the Southeast coast
this afternoon, and will move northward toward the mid-Atlantic region
through Saturday. Ophelia is expected to make landfall across the
coastal Carolinas early Saturday.
Regardless of the exact track, the storm is expected to bring a myriad
of hazards to our area. These impacts include:
* Dangerous marine and high surf - Dangerous marine conditions are expected
late tonight into Saturday due to the strong winds and high seas.
Seas build to 11 to 16 feet late tonight into Saturday and remain
elevated into Sunday. Large breaking waves of 3 to 5 ft will result
in dangerous surf conditions and a high risk for rip currents.
* Heavy Rain - heavy downpours could cause localized minor flooding of roads
and low-lying areas, especially across northeast north Carolina,
eastern and central Virginia, and the lower eastern shore of Maryland
and Virginia.
* Winds - Tropical Storm force wind is expected to arrive this evening into
early Saturday and could lead to downed trees and scattered power
outages.
* Coastal Flooding - Areas of moderate to major coastal flooding are
possible during high tide late tonight into Saturday.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for dangerous wind having possible significant impacts across
EASTERN VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST NORTH CAROLINA...AND THE LOWER MARYLAND
EASTERN SHORE. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding, along with damage to
porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. Some buildings
experience window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile homes
damaged, some destroyed, especially if poorly anchored or
exposed to wind. Unsecured lightweight objects become dangerous
projectiles.
- Large trees snapped or uprooted, especially in areas where
soils are saturated. Some roadway signs will be blown over.
- Some roads will be impassable from large debris including
bridges, causeways, and access routes.
- Scattered to widespread power and communications outages.
Also, prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts
across CENTRAL VIRGINIA.
* SURGE:
Prepare for life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across EASTERN VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST NORTH CAROLINA.
Potential impacts in this area include:
- Severe storm surge flooding will likely cause inundation of
numerous roads and buildings, resulting in a threat to life and
property. Flooding will likely extend inland from the
waterfront and shoreline flooding homes, businesses and
isolating some neighborhoods. Large breaking waves will result
in additional damage near the shoreline.
- Numerous roads flooded or washed out.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching some dunes.
- Severe damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers is
expected. Small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected marinas and docks.
Also, prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across THE MARYLAND EASTERN SHORE.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant
impacts across CENTRAL AND EASTERN VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST NORTH
CAROLINA...AND THE LOWER MARYLAND EASTERN SHORE. Potential impacts
include:
- Flooding from heavy rainfall may prompt evacuations and rescues
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen, with swift
currents, and overspill their banks. Small streams, creeks, and
ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures and/or weaken
foundations. Some areas may experience areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures are expected.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a dangerous tornado event having possible significant
impacts across SOUTHEAST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST NORTH CAROLINA.
Potential impacts include:
- Some tornadoes are expected, some of which could be intense. As
a result, execution of emergency plans could be hindered in
affected areas.
- Several places may experience tornado damage, with a few areas
of considerable damage, power loss, and communications failures.
- Locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses, mobile homes
demolished, large trees snapped or uprooted, vehicles tumbled,
and small boats tossed about.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
If evacuating, leave with a destination in mind and allow extra time
to get there. Take your emergency supplies kit. Gas up your vehicle
ahead of time.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies
kit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your
home or business.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
near the ocean or a large inland lake, in a low-lying or poor
drainage area, in a valley, or near an already swollen river, plan to
move to safe shelter on higher ground.
When securing your property, outside preparations should be concluded
as soon as possible before conditions deteriorate. The onset of
strong gusty winds or flooding can cause certain preparedness
activities to become unsafe.
Be sure to let friends and family members know of your intentions for
weathering the storm and your whereabouts. Have someone located away
from the threatened area serve as your point of contact. Share vital
contact information with others. Keep cell phones handy and charged.
If you are a visitor, know the name of the county or parish in which
you are located and where it is relative to current watches and
warnings. If staying at a hotel, ask the management staff about their
onsite disaster plan. Listen for evacuation orders, especially
pertaining to area visitors.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes
to the forecast.
