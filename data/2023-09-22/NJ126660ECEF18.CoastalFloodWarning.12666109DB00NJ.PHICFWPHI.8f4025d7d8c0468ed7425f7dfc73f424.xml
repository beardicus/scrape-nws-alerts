<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued September 22 at 6:46AM EDT until September 23 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Philadelphia - Mount Holly</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY
EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM TO 8 PM EDT SATURDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON TO 8 PM EDT
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of up to 8
feet expected in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Warning,
one to two feet of inundation above ground level expected in
low- lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...Coastal Ocean.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Saturday
evening. For the High Surf Advisory, from 6 AM to 8 PM EDT
Saturday. For the Coastal Flood Warning, from noon to 8 PM EDT
Saturday.
* IMPACTS...At this level, widespread roadway flooding occurs in
coastal and bayside communities and along inland tidal
waterways. Many roads become impassable. Some damage to
vulnerable structures may begin to occur. Dangerous swimming
and surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...With the long duration of onshore winds
expected, the back bays may struggle to drain during low
tides. This could result in minor to moderate coastal flooding
lingering after high tide. Additionally, minor flooding is
possible again with the Sunday afternoon high tide.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
