- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Coastal New Hanover,
Coastal Pender, Inland New Hanover, and Inland Pender

SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen off the Southeast U.S. coast
will move northward through Saturday, possibly becoming a tropical
storm before likely making landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina.
The primary hazards across southeast North Carolina and northeast
South Carolina are expected to be:
- Marine/Surf - Hazardous marine and surf conditions along the entire
coastline of northeast South Carolina and southeast North Carolina
- Heavy Rain - Heavy downpours could cause localized minor flooding of
roads and low-lying areas, mainly across eastern portions of southeast
North Carolina
- Winds - Tropical storm force winds, especially in gusts, are likely,
especially along the coast north of Cape Fear
- Coastal Flooding - Minor coastal flooding possible, especially north
of Cape Fear during the Friday afternoon high tide
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant
impacts across southeast North Carolina, particularly along and north
of Cape Fear. Flooding rainfall also possible along portions of coastal
northeast South Carolina, including eastern Horry County. Potential
impacts include:
- Moderate flooding from rainfall may prompt some evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and streams may rise and overspill their banks in a few
places, especially in the typical prone locations. Small creeks
and ditches may overflow.
- Flood waters may enter some structures. Underpasses, low-lying
spots along roadways, and poor drainage areas may become
submerged by rising water. Some secondary streets and parking
lots may flood as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.
- Driving conditions will become hazardous, and some road
closures can be expected.
Protect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts along and west of I-95, as well as Marion,
Williamsburg, and Georgetown Counties.
* WIND:
Protect against dangerous wind having possible significant impacts
across southeast North Carolina and northeast South Carolina.
Potential impacts in this area include:
- Some damage to porches and awnings, carports, sheds, and mobile
homes is possible. Unsecured lightweight objects may be blown
about.
- Some large limbs may break from trees. A few shallow rooted or
weak trees may snap or be knocked down. Some fences and roadway
signs damaged.
- A few roads may become impassable due to debris, particularly
within urban or heavily wooded locations. Hazardous driving
conditions are possible, especially for high profile vehicles
on bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages are possible.
* SURGE:
Protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited impacts
across coastal southeast North Carolina, particularly north of Cape
Fear. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Localized inundation and minor over-wash is possible, mainly
along immediate shorelines and other vulnerable low-lying areas
along the coast. Low spots along waterways and tidal creeks may
also be impacted.
- Navigation may be difficult near inlets and waterways, as
navigational aids may be off station or missing.
- Minor beach erosion possible.
Elsewhere across southeast North Carolina and northeast South
Carolina, little to no impact is anticipated.
* OTHER COASTAL HAZARDS:
Hazardous surf conditions, including life-threatening rip currents, are
expected through Saturday along the entire southeast North Carolina and
northeast South Carolina coasts.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to bring to completion all preparations to protect
life and property in accordance with your emergency plan.
Outside preparations should be wrapped up as soon as possible before
weather conditions completely deteriorate. Any remaining evacuations
and relocations should be expedited before the onset of tropical
storm force wind.
Keep cell phones well charged and handy. Also, cell phone chargers
for automobiles can be helpful after the storm. Locate your chargers
and keep them with your cell phone.
Closely monitor NOAA Weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes to
the forecast.
