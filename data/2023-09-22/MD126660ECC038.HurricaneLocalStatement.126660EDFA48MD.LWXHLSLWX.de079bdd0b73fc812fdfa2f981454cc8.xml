**Tropical Storm Conditions Expected over Southern Maryland Tonight thorugh Early Sunday**
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Calvert and St. Marys
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 590 miles south-southeast of Washington DC
- 30.5N 75.0W
- Storm Intensity 50 mph
- Movement North or 360 degrees at 14 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen will move north-northwestward
toward the Mid-Atlantic Coast today before moving northward near the
Mid-Atlantic Coast Saturday through Sunday.
The main threat will be a storm surge with inundation around 2 to
3 feet most likely for locations along the western shore of the
Chesapeake Bay as well as the shore of the tidal Potomac River. The
highest water levels will be around times of high tide Saturday
through Saturday night.
Rainfall will most likely average between 2 to 4 inches with localized
amounts up to 5 inches possible. This may result in isolated instances
of flooding, especially for low lying and flood prone areas. The
heaviest rain is most likely to occur Saturday into Saturday night.
Tropical Storm force winds are most likely over southern Maryland and
the nearby waters south of North Beach along the Chesapeake Bay and
south of Cobb Island along the tidal Potomac River. However,
gale-force winds are expected along the waters father north along the
Chesapeake Bay as well as the tidal Potomac River. Gusty winds and a
saturated ground may cause downed trees and power outages.
While the severe weather threat is low, an isolated tornado cannot out
be ruled across southern Maryland on Saturday afternoon and evening.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts.
Potential impacts in this area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* SURGE:
Moderate tidal inundation is possible along the shore of the Chesapeake Bay
and tidal Potomac River.
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread
with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where
surge water covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Isolated instances of flooding are possible due to locally heavy
rainfall. The best chance for flooding will be in low lying flood
prone areas as well as urban locations.
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals,
arroyos, and ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
Protect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across southern Maryland.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts
across southern Maryland. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
Closely monitor weather.gov. NOAA Weather Radio or local news outlets
