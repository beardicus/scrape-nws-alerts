<description>...WET PATTERN AHEAD BUT THREAT OF FLASH FLOODING IS DIMINISHED...
A surface trough continues to approach the Marianas from the east and
will bring increasing showers to the Marianas tonight through
Wednesday. Latest model guidance indicates the most likely timing for
heavier showers will be between Monday evening and Tuesday night.
While a wet pattern still lies ahead, the threat of significant
rainfall has diminished due to the lessened likelihood of a
circulation forming within the passing trough axis. Showers and
thunderstorms could be heavy at times Monday night through Tuesday
night and could result in some nuisance flooding of streams and low-
lying areas.
The National Weather Service will continue closely monitoring
conditions for the possibility of significant rains and will issue
advisories and warnings as needed. For the latest forecasts, warnings
and advisories, see us on the web at weather.gov/gum.</description>
