<description>...Locally strong winds in the West Wendover area this afternoon...
A strong cold front will be pushing east into southeastern Elko
county, including the city of West Wendover. Strong west to
northwest winds of 25 to 35 mph with gusts to 55 mph will be
likely today along with some light snow showers. No accumulations
are expected. Locally stronger winds of 40 to 45 mph with gusts of
60 to 65 mph will be possible, which will bring hazardous driving
conditions for high profile vehicles. In addition, blowing dust
will help to limit visibility to less than one-half mile in
spots. If driving along I-80, motorists are urged to use caution
as rapid reductions to visibility and strong crosswinds will cause
difficult driving conditions. The strong winds will last until
later this afternoon.
