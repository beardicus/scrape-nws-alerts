<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM AST THIS MORNING...
The Flood Watch continues for
* Portions of Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands, including the
following areas, in Puerto Rico, Central Interior, Culebra,
Eastern Interior, Mayaguez and Vicinity, North Central,
Northeast, Northwest, Ponce and Vicinity, San Juan and
Vicinity, Southeast, Southwest, Vieques, and Western Interior.
In Virgin Islands, St Croix and St.Thomas...St. John...and
Adjacent Islands.
* WHEN...Until 8 AM AST this morning
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone
locations.
Based on the most recent guidance, scattered to numerous showers and
isolated thunderstorms will continue today across the forecast area.
The areas most likely to receive the highest rainfall accumulations
are the eastern and southeastern sections of Puerto Rico as well
as the US Virgin Islands. In these areas, there will still remain
the potential for additional 1-3 inches at least until early Tuesday
morning.
There is an elevated to significant risk for flooding of urban
areas,roads and small streams, especially over the eastern PR,
Culebra and isolated areas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Life threatening
flash flooding and mudslides will remain possible as well. Some rivers
and stream will likely overflow their banks. As a result the Flash
Flood Watch is in effect through at least 8 AM this morning
pending additional follow up later in the day based on the
conditions and latest model guidance.
