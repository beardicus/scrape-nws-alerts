<description>...Locally Dense Fog Developing Over Northwest Lake County...
At 225 AM, surface observations, satellite imagery and traffic
cameras showed an area of dense fog had formed over northwest Lake
County from south of Okahumpka to Lady Lake, including Leesburg,
Lisbon, Umatilla, Tavares and Mount Dora. Visibilities had dropped
to around one quarter mile in some locations.
The fog will pose a hazard to drivers early this morning, and
could last through at lest sunrise. Be especially careful if
you will be driving on the Florida Turnpike, U.S. Highways 27 and
441, and State Roads 19 and 44.
When driving in dense fog, reduce your speed, use only your low
beam headlights, and leave extra following distance between your
vehicle and the one in front of you.</description>
