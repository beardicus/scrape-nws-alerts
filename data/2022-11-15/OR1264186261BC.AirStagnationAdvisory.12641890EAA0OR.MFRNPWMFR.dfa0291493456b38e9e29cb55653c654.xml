<headline>Air Stagnation Advisory issued November 15 at 5:03AM PST until November 18 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...AIR STAGNATION ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Stagnant air is expected, which may lead to
deteriorating air quality.
* WHERE...The sheltered valleys of Jackson County, including the
cities of Rogue River, Shady Cove, White City, Central Point,
Medford and Jacksonville.
* WHEN...Until 10 AM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Air stagnation is likely to result in diminishing
air quality with time, especially in and near areas with
significant sources of air pollution. Diminished air quality
is likely to cause health issues for people with respiratory
problems if precautions are not taken.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Southeast winds will likely surface in
the south end of the Rogue Valley near Ashland through
Wednesday, so air stagnation is less likely there.

<instruction>People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with diminished air quality. N95 masks are
effective at filtering out the majority of harmful air
particulates.
State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor
burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be
limited as much as possible. According to state air quality
agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants
close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with
your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
