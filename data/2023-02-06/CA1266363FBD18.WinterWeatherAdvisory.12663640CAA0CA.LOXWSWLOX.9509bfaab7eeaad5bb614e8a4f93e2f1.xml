<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued February 06 at 3:10AM PST until February 06 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST THIS
MORNING...
* WHAT...Light snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 3
inches, mainly on north facing slopes. Snow level around 3500
feet. Northwest to north winds 25 to 40 mph with gusts as high
as 55 mph, strongest through the Interstate 5 corridor.
* WHERE...Ventura County Mountains and Los Angeles County
Mountains.
* WHEN...Until 10 AM PST this morning.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult due to accumulating
snow, icy road conditions, and strong winds. Expect travel
delays and possible road closures, including Interstate 5 near
the Grapevine. Strong winds could cause tree damage and
reduced visibilities in blowing snow. Cold wind chills between
5 and 15 degrees could result in hypothermia if precautions
are not taken.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Interstate 5 near the Grapevine will likely
see at least 1 inch of accumulating snow and icy road conditions.
Strong winds during the time of snow will likely cause
unusually cold wind chills for this area, along with the
potential for blowing snow.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
The latest road conditions for the state you are calling from can
be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
