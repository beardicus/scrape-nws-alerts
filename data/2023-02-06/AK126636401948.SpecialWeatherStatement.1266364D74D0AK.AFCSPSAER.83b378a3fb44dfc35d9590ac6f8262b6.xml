<description>...PERIODS OF MODERATE TO HEAVY SNOW SOUTH OF NINILCHIK THROUGH
MONDAY MORNING...
Bands of moderate to heavy snow have developed from southern Cook
Inlet to Homer and Seldovia this morning in the wake of an area
of low pressure moving north across the Kenai Peninsula. As of 4am
AKST, the heaviest snow band is situated over Seldovia with light
to moderate snow falling over Homer. These bands of snow will
slowly lift across Kachemak Bay through the early morning hours,
with heavier snow at times overspreading Homer and the Homer
Bluffs. Gusty southwesterly winds are expected to develop early
this morning and may lead to periods of blowing snow across the
Homer Bluffs through Monday morning. The heavier snow is expected
to taper off along the immediate coast later this morning,
limiting snow amounts for Homer and Seldovia. However, snow is
expected to linger across the Homer Bluffs through Monday
afternoon. Snow totals of 2 to 4 inches are possible along the
Kachemak Bay coast, with upwards of 6 inches possible for areas
along the Homer Bluffs.</description>
