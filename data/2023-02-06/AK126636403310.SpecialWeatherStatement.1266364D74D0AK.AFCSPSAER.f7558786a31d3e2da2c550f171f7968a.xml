<description>...SNOW MAY IMPACT THE MONDAY EVENING COMMUTE ACROSS THE ANCHORAGE
BOWL...
Snow is expected to develop across the Anchorage Bowl Monday
morning in response to an area of low pressure moving north from
the Kenai Peninsula. Any snow this morning is expected to be light
in intensity and fall mainly after the Monday morning commute.
Snowfall rates are expected to increase by late Monday morning or
early Monday afternoon, with the potential for a period of
moderate to heavy snow just in time for the evening commute. The
snow is then expected to taper off Monday evening before ending
Monday night. Snow accumulations of 2 to 4 inches are expected,
with locally higher amounts possible across the southern half of
Anchorage and along the Anchorage Hillside. Motorists are urged to
slow down and use caution while traveling.
There is still uncertainty regarding the exact timing of any
heavier snowfall. Please visit www.weather.gov/afc for updates to
the forecast.
