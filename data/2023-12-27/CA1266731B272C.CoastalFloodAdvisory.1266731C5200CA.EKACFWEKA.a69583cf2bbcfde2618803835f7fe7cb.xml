8 PM PST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking
waves of 28 to 32 feet. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, High
astronomical tides will cause minor flooding in low lying areas
along the Crescent City Harbor. Up to one quarter foot of
saltwater inundation above ground level is possible in low lying
areas near shorelines and tidal waterways (Between 8.9 and 9.0
feet MLLW at the Crescent City tide gauge).
* WHERE...Coastal Del Norte County.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Warning, from 8 PM this evening to 8
PM PST Thursday. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 10 AM
this morning to noon PST today.. .

and into dangerous seas. Life-threatening surfing conditions and
significant beach erosion can be expected. These tides will
likely impact False Klamath Cove, Anchor Way and Pebble Beach.</description>
<instruction>A Coastal Flood Advisory indicates that onshore winds and tides
will combine to generate flooding of low areas along the shore.
Feet Above Ground is locally defined as feet above the Highest
Astronomical Tide or HAT.
Large breaking waves along the coast will lead to increased wave
run-up on beaches with waves topping and washing over large rocks
and jetties. These large waves can be erratic and unpredictable.
Use extra caution near the surf zone as these large waves will be
capable of sweeping people into the frigid and turbulent ocean
water. Mariners traversing the bar are urged to exercise extreme
caution or stay in port until the threat subsides. Please contact
the U.S. Coast Guard for information regarding harbor and bar
closures.</instruction>
