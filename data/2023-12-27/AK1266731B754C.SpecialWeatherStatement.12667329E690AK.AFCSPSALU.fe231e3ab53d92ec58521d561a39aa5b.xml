<description>...STRONG FRONT TO BRING SNOW, BLOWING SNOW, AND MIXED
PRECIPITATION TO CENTRAL ALEUTIANS TONIGHT...
A strong front will move east across the Aleutians today, bringing
strong southerly winds, snow, blowing snow and some rain to Adak
and Atka. Cold air ahead of the front should lead to snow as the
initial precipitation type as the front reaches Adak around 7pm
followed by Atka around 9pm. Strong southerly winds will likely
keep air temperatures between 32 and 36 degrees, leading to wet
snow falling in southerly winds up to 55 mph. Snow will likely
have difficulty drifting at sea level due to warmer temperatures,
but even a slight increase in elevation will make blowing snow
more likely. As precipitation comes to an end between midnight and
3am, expect a brief change over to rain or a rain snow mix as
temperatures reach their peak. Visibility may be reduced to less
than one half mile at times due to the strong wind and falling
snow.</description>
