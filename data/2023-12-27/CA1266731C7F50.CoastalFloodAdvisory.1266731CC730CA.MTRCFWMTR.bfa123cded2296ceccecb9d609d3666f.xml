<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued December 27 at 1:16PM PST until December 27 at 3:00PM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 PM PST THIS
AFTERNOON...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM TO 1 PM PST
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...For the first Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal
flooding. For the second Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal
flooding expected.
* WHERE...North Bay Interior Valleys and San Francisco Bay
Shoreline Counties.
* WHEN...For the first Coastal Flood Advisory, until 3 PM PST
this afternoon. For the second Coastal Flood Advisory, from 10
AM to 1 PM PST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Breaking waves can sweep
people off jetties and docks, and into dangerous seas. Life-
threatening swimming conditions and significant beach erosion
can be expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Tidal levels are running around 1 foot
higher than tidal predictions due to strong southerly winds.
High tide will peak about 11:26 am PST Thursday between 7.0 to
7.5 feet above MLLW, resulting in minor coastal flooding for
low-lying, flood-prone spots adjacent to the San Francisco Bay.
Strong southerly winds and increasing surf will contribute to
coastal flooding along the Pacific Ocean beginning Wednesday.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
