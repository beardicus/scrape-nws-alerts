<headline>High Surf Warning issued December 27 at 8:51PM PST until December 29 at 3:00AM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 AM PST
FRIDAY...
...HIGH SURF WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM THURSDAY TO 3 AM
PST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding
expected. For the High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking
waves of 28 to 33 ft with up to 40 ft possible at favored
locations. High surf will subside Friday before another large swell
train arrives Saturday.
* WHERE...San Francisco, Coastal North Bay Including Point Reyes
National Seashore, San Francisco Peninsula Coast, Northern
Monterey Bay and Southern Monterey Bay and Big Sur Coast
Counties.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 3 AM PST Friday.
For the High Surf Warning, from 3 AM Thursday to 3 AM PST
Friday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Breaking waves can sweep
people off jetties and docks, and into dangerous seas. Life-
threatening swimming conditions and significant beach erosion
can be expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Tidal levels are running around 1 foot
higher than tidal predictions. High tide will peak about 10:46
am PST Wednesday between 7.0 to 7.5 feet above MLLW, resulting
in minor coastal flooding for low-lying, flood-prone spots
adjacent to the San Francisco Bay. Strong southerly winds and
increasing surf will contribute to coastal flooding along the
Pacific Ocean beginning Wednesday.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other waterside
infrastructure.</instruction>
