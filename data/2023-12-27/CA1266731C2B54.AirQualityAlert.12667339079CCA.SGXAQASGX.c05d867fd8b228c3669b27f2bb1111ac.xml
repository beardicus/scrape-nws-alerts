<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT: MANDATORY WOOD-BURNING BAN IN EFFECT...
The South Coast AQMD has extended a mandatory wood-burning ban for
residents in the South Coast Air Basin for Wed Dec 27 through Thurs
Dec 28.
No-Burn days are declared to protect public health when levels of
fine particle air pollution in the region are forecast to be high.
Smoke from wood burning can cause health problems. Breathing high
levels of pollution from wood smoke can cause breathing problems
(including asthma attacks), worsened lung and heart disease
symptoms, and may even increase emergency room visits and
hospitalizations.
The No-Burn rule prohibits burning wood as well as manufactured fire
logs, such as those made from wax or paper in any indoor or outdoor
wood-burning device. This prohibition does not apply to communities
above 3,000 ft in elevation, households that rely on wood as a sole
source of heat, residences without nearby natural gas service, and
low-income households.
To view current and forecasted air quality levels, visit the South
Coast Air Quality Management District website at aqmd.gov or
download the mobile app at aqmd.gov/mobileapp. Additional details
for this air quality alert are available at www.aqmd.gov/advisory.
