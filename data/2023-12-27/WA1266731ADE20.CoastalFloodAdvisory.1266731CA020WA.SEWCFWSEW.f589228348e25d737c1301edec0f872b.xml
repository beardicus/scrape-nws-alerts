<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued December 27 at 2:48AM PST until December 27 at 2:00PM PST by NWS Seattle</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM THIS MORNING TO
2 PM PST THIS AFTERNOON...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM THIS EVENING TO 4 PM
PST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding
expected. Inundation of up to two feet feet above ground level
is possible along shorelines and low-lying coastal areas near
time of high tide, which corresponds to minor flood level. For
the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 20 to 23 feet
expected in the surf zone.
* WHERE...North Coast and Central Coast zones.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 10 AM this morning
to 2 PM PST this afternoon. For the High Surf Advisory, from 9
PM this evening to 4 PM PST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Minor coastal flooding due to tidal overflow is
expected around high tide. This may lead to flooding of parking
lots, parks, and roads, with only isolated road closures
expected. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion with the high surf.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inundation above ground level refers to the height above the Mean
Higher High Water (MHHW) level.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.</instruction>
