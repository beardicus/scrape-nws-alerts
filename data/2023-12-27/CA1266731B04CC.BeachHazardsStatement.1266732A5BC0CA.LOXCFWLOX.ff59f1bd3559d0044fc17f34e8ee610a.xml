<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued December 27 at 3:47AM PST until December 28 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE
TONIGHT...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM THURSDAY TO
10 PM PST SATURDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM THURSDAY TO
10 PM PST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, nuisance to minor
coastal flooding expected. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor
coastal flooding expected. For the High Surf Advisory, large
breaking waves of 7 to 12 feet with dangerous rip currents.
Local sets of 15 to 20 feet will be likely near Point
Conception. The most dangerous conditions are expected on
Thursday.
* WHERE...Catalina and Santa Barbara Islands, Santa Barbara
County Southwestern Coast, Santa Barbara County Southeastern
Coast, Malibu Coast and Los Angeles County Beaches.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, through late tonight.
For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 4 AM Thursday to 10 PM
PST Saturday. For the High Surf Advisory, from 4 AM Thursday
to 10 PM PST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely, around the time of
high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as
parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to
roads or structures is NOT expected. There is an increased
risk for ocean drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers and
surfers out to sea. Large breaking waves can cause injury,
wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats
near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Each morning Thursday through Saturday,
residual high tides of 6.0 to 6.5 feet will enhance the
coastal flooding risk.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
