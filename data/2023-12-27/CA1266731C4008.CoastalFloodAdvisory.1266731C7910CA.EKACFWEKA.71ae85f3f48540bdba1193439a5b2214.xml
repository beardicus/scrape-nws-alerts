<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM PST THIS
AFTERNOON...
...HIGH SURF WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 8 PM THIS EVENING TO
8 PM PST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking
waves 28 to 32 feet. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, High
astronomical tides will cause minor flooding in low lying
areas along Humboldt Bay. Up to one quarter foot of saltwater
inundation above ground level is possible in low lying areas
near shorelines and tidal waterways (Between 9.1 and 9.4 feet
MLLW at the North Spit tide gauge).
* WHERE...Northern Humboldt Coast County.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Warning, from 8 PM this evening to 8
PM PST Thursday. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 9 AM
this morning to 1 PM PST this afternoon.. .
* IMPACTS...Breaking waves can sweep people off jetties and
docks, and into dangerous seas. Life-threatening surfing
conditions and significant beach erosion can be expected.
These tides will likely impact Jackson Ranch Road in the
Arcata Bottoms and low lying roads in King Salmon.</description>
<instruction>A Coastal Flood Advisory indicates that onshore winds and tides
will combine to generate flooding of low areas along the shore.
Feet Above Ground is locally defined as feet above the Highest
Astronomical Tide or HAT.
Large breaking waves along the coast will lead to increased wave
run-up on beaches with waves topping and washing over large rocks
and jetties. These large waves can be erratic and unpredictable.
Use extra caution near the surf zone as these large waves will be
capable of sweeping people into the frigid and turbulent ocean
water. Mariners traversing the bar are urged to exercise extreme
caution or stay in port until the threat subsides. Please contact
the U.S. Coast Guard for information regarding harbor and bar
closures.</instruction>
