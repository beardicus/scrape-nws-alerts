<headline>Flood Watch issued June 05 at 10:23PM CDT  by NWS Wichita</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 AM CDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Central, South Central, and Southeast Kansas,
including the following counties, in Central Kansas, Chase,
Ellsworth, Lincoln, Marion, McPherson, Rice and Saline. In South
Central Kansas, Butler, Cowley, Harper, Harvey, Kingman, Reno,
Sedgwick and Sumner. In Southeast Kansas, Allen, Chautauqua, Elk,
Greenwood, Labette, Montgomery, Neosho, Wilson and Woodson.
* WHEN...Until 7 AM CDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water
crossings may be flooded. Extensive street flooding is possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Areas of heavy rainfall have impacted the area the past few
days. Numerous showers and thunderstorms will continue to
impact the region overnight, especially generally along and
south of the Highway 50 corridor, although scattered showers
and thunderstorms are expected north of Highway 50 as well.
Pockets of very heavy rainfall are likely, which will produce
localized flooding and flash flooding concerns, and aggravate
flooding concerns that are ongoing.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.
Do not drive into flooded areas or go around barricades. Nearly two
feet of water will carry most vehicles away. Turn around, don`t
drown.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.</instruction>
