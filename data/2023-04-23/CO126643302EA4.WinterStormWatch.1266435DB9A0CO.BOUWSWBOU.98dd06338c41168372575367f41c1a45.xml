<description>...HIGH IMPACT WINTER STORM TUESDAY INTO EARLY WEDNESDAY...
.A significant winter storm will impact the region Monday through
Wednesday, and will produce a period of heavy snow particularly
from  midday Tuesday through early Wednesday morning. Widespread
storm total snowfall amounts between 1 and 2 feet are expected for a
good portion of the Front Range mountains and upper elevations of
the foothills. Snowfall rates of 2 inches per hour will be possible
during the heavier snowfall, and travel will likely be very
difficult during this period. Snow levels will lower Tuesday night,
and may result in impactful snow accumulations for some of the lower
elevations, particularly the Palmer Divide.
...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH
WEDNESDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Heavy snow likely. 1 to 2 feet of snow expected, with
locally higher amounts possible.
* WHERE...Front Range mountains, including Rocky Mountain NP, the
Indian Peaks Wilderness, and the Eisenhower Tunnel, as well as
foothill communities such as Estes Park, Nederland, and Evergreen
above 8,000 feet.
* WHEN...From Tuesday morning through Wednesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Travel may become very difficult to impossible due to
heavy snowfall on roadways. The hazardous conditions could impact
the Tuesday evening commute.</description>
