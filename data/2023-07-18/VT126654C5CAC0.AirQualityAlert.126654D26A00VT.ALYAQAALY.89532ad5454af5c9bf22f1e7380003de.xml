<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EDT TONIGHT...
The Vermont Agency of Natural Resources has issued a Air Quality
Action Day for Fine Particulates for southern Vermont until midnight
EDT tonight.
Smoke from the Ohio valley region, originally from wildfires in far
northwestern Canada, will continue to impact Vermont through Tuesday.
Additionally, on a localized basis, dust may be generated from
cleaning operations in the aftermath of recent flooding. The combined
impacts may produce &quot;unhealthy&quot; air quality for the entire
population in localized areas.
The Vermont Agency of Natural Resources has issued an Air Quality
Alert for fine particle pollution from wildfire smoke for all of
Vermont. The 24 hour average Air Quality Index (AQI) is expected to
occur within the Code Orange or Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups
category. However, note that pollutant levels may occur in the code
red or &quot;unhealthy&quot; range for all individuals on an hourly basis.
Who needs to be concerned? Sensitive groups include people with heart
or lung disease, older adults, children and teenagers, minority
populations, and outdoor workers.
What should you do? Sensitive groups should reduce prolonged or heavy
exertion. It`s okay to be active outside, but take more breaks and do
less intense activities. Watch for symptoms such as coughing or
shortness of breath. People with asthma should follow their asthma
action plans and keep quick relief medicine handy. If you have heart
disease, symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath, or
unusual fatigue may indicate a serious problem. If you have any of
these, contact your healthcare provider.
