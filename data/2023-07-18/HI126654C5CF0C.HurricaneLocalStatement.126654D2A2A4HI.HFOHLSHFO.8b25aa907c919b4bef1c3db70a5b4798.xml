SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
The center of Tropical Storm Calvin is forecast to pass over, or
just south of, the Big Island of Hawaii tonight and early
Wednesday, then pass well south of the other Hawaiian Islands
through Wednesday night. Impacts are expected to be greatest on the
Big Island, but strong winds, locally heavy rainfall and high surf
along east facing shores can be expected statewide.
Heavy rainfall will likely begin this evening on the Big Island,
with chances for heavy rain increasing elsewhere across through
Wednesday as Calvin moves steadily toward the west. Expect storm
total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches, locally up to 10 inches upslope
across windward portions of the Big Island. Storm total
precipitation on Maui will be 3 to 6 inches and 2 to 4 inches across
the rest of the state, highest amounts over windward and mountain
areas.
Coastal impacts associated with Calvin will include rapidly building
surf tonight through Wednesday. Surf may reach as high as 15
feet along east facing shores of the Big Island, and up to 10 feet
along east facing shores of the other islands. Although peak surf
heights on the Big Island will likely occur around low tide
Wednesday morning, some minor overwash and erosion is possible for
exposed low-lying coastal areas.
Locally strong winds are likely to begin this evening over the Big
Island, with north winds shifting to the northeast and east as
Calvin moves westward through Wednesday morning. Winds will also
become breezy and primarily northeast across the smaller islands
outside of the cyclone due to strong gradient winds Wednesday and
Wednesday night. It is important to note that the mountainous terrain
of the islands can produce localized areas of enhanced winds,
even well away from the tropical cyclone center.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
the Hawaiian islands. Potential impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* SURGE:
Protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across portions of windward and southeast Big Island.
Potential impacts in this area include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread
with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where
surge water covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
Elsewhere across the Hawaiian islands, little to no impact is
anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible
significant impacts across Maui and windward and southeastern portions
of the Big Island. Potential
impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals,
arroyos, and ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
Prepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across other Hawaiian Islands from Kauai to Molokai.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts
across the Hawaiian islands. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
Now is the time to complete necessary actions to protect your family
and secure your home or business, prior to the onset of tropical storm
conditions tonight.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the exact
forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging wind gusts,
storm surge, and tornadoes can extend well away from the center of the
storm. Keep cell phones well charged as localized power outages are
possible.
