<description>This product covers the Hawaiian islands
**TROPICAL STORM CALVIN BEGINNING TO PASS SOUTH OF THE BIG ISLAND**
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Hawaii County
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 305 miles southeast of Honolulu or about 140 miles south
of Hilo
- 17.7N 155.2W
- Storm Intensity 50 mph
- Movement West or 275 degrees at 20 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Calvin, currently located southeast of South Point,
will continue westward through the overnight hours, then pass well
south of the smaller islands through the day Wednesday. Periods of
heavy rainfall, damaging winds, and life threatening surf along
exposed east facing shores will continue through Wednesday.
Bands of heavy rainfall will continue to move ashore and impact
portions of the Big Island overnight through Wednesday morning.
Streams have already begun to respond on the Big Island, and with
rainfall totals expected to climb into the 4 to 8 inch range with
locally higher amounts possible, the potential for flash flooding
will quickly increase through the late evening and overnight hours.
Similar conditions are expected to begin for portions of Maui County
through the late night hours, which will likely continue well into
Wednesday. Rainfall totals are expected to climb into the 3 to 6
inch range for Maui County and 2 to 4 inches for Oahu and Kauai
County, mainly over windward and mountain locations.
Damaging winds are expected to continue overnight into Wednesday for
the Big Island and Maui County, which may lead to power outages,
downed trees and powerlines, potentially leading to impassable
roads. Advisory-level winds are anticipated for Oahu and Kauai,
especially through the day Wednesday as Calvin passes to the south.
This is especially the case in areas over and downwind of terrain.
Significant coastal impacts will continue overnight through
Wednesday morning along exposed east facing shores of the Big Island
and Maui due to a combination of damaging onshore winds and life-
threatening surf. Surf at this level combined with water levels
running higher than predicted and surge associated with Calvin will
will produce significant beach erosion, with water potentially
inundating vulnerable coastal areas and roadways. For Oahu and
Kauai, expect the surf to rapidly build to advisory levels
overnight, then remain up through the day Wednesday. The threat of
coastal impacts will begin to lower quickly through the day
Wednesday for he Big Island as Calvin continues westward, then for
the smaller islands by Wednesday night into Thursday.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
the Hawaiian islands. Potential impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* SURGE:
Protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across portions of windward and southeast Big Island.
Potential impacts in this area include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread
with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where
surge water covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible
significant impacts across across Maui and windward and southeastern
portions of the Big Island. Potential impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals,
arroyos, and ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts
across the Hawaiian islands. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions.
Listen for updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power.
Keep a battery-powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.
