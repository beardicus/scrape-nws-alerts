<description>...CODE ORANGE AIR QUALITY ALERT HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR JEFFERSON AND
SHELBY COUNTIES TODAY...
The Jefferson County Department of Health has issued a Code Orange
Air Quality Alert for Jefferson and Shelby Counties for Today,
Tuesday, July 18.
Under Code Orange conditions, particulate matter concentrations are
expected to reach levels that are unhealthy for sensitive groups.
People with heart or lung disease, older adults, and children should
reduce prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors.
JCDH recommends the following actions during an air quality alert
for particulate matter.
Avoid exposure to wood, forest, or agricultural smoke.
Reduce outside activity. Walk instead of jog. Do not exercise near
busy roads.
Plan outdoor activities for days when particle levels are lower.
Limit driving and engine idling. Combine errands. Use the bus or
carpool to work.
Avoid use of gasoline powered lawn and garden equipment.
Outside particulate matter can affect indoor air quality, especially
when outdoor levels are high. Keep windows and doors closed to
prevent further circulation of particles. You can further reduce
indoor particle levels by eliminating tobacco smoke, limiting
cooking with wood, coal, oil, or natural gas, and limiting the use
of candles, incense, and household cleaners.
If breathing becomes difficult, move indoors.</description>
