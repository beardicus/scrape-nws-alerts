<headline>Flood Watch issued July 18 at 3:33AM EDT  by NWS Burlington</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON EDT TODAY THROUGH LATE
TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of northern New York, including the following
counties, Eastern Clinton, Eastern Essex, Western Clinton and
Western Essex. Portions of Vermont, including the following
counties, Caledonia, Eastern Addison, Eastern Chittenden, Eastern
Franklin, Eastern Rutland, Eastern Windsor, Essex, Grand Isle,
Lamoille, Orange, Orleans, Washington, Western Addison, Western
Chittenden, Western Franklin, Western Rutland and Western Windsor.
* WHEN...From Noon EDT today through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Storm drains
and ditches may become clogged with debris. Area creeks and
streams are running high and could flood with more heavy rain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- One round of shower and thunderstorm activity with brief
heavy rainfall will affect parts of the area early this
morning. A break in the action is expected later this morning
before additional shower and thunderstorm activity develops
this afternoon, continuing into this evening. Rainfall
amounts from this afternoon`s thunderstorm activity could
reach 1 to 2 inches per hour with the stronger storms. Recent
heavy rainfall has led to soil conditions across the region
being completely saturated. The ground has no capacity to
absorb heavy rainfall which leads to immediate runoff into
creeks and streams and can cause renewed flash flooding.
