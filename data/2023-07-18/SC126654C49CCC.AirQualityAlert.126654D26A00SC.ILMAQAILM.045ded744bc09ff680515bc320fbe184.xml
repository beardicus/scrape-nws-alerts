<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EDT TONIGHT...
The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control in
Columbia SC has issued a Code Orange Fine Particulate Matter Action
Day for the northern half of South Carolina until midnight EDT
tonight.
Counties within the Air Quality Alert include:
Darlington, Dillon, Florence Marion and Marlboro
Residents of South Carolina should be aware of the risk for health effects
related to smoke from wildfires that originated from fires burning
across parts of western Canada, the Department of Health and
Environmental Control (DHEC) reported on Tuesday, July 18th. Smoke
from these fires has been in place across the state since Monday, and
smoke will likely continue through at least Tuesday, July 18th.
Smoke can irritate the eyes and respiratory system, as well as
aggravate or exacerbate chronic heart and lung diseases.
An Air Quality Alert means that the fine particulate concentrations
within the affected region may approach or exceed unhealthy
standards, especially for those individuals sensitive to particle
pollution.
It is expected that the health and visibility impacts from
the smoke will continue within all regions of the state at least
through the day Tuesday. The most significant smoke (and highest fine
particulate concentrations) has been observed across northern South
Carolina. As a result, unhealthy for sensitive individuals levels of
fine particulate concentrations will be likely across the northern
half of South Carolina through Tuesday.
DHEC recommends individuals with respiratory health issues limit
time spent outdoors to avoid the smoke. Keep windows and doors
closed. Run an air conditioner if you have one but keep the fresh-air
intake closed and the filter clean to prevent outdoor smoke from
getting inside.
