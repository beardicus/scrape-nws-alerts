<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 815 PM HST THIS
EVENING FOR THE ISLAND OF KAUAI IN KAUAI COUNTY...
At 651 PM HST, radar indicated that heavy rain had ended over Kauai.
However, runoff from earlier heavy rainfall continues, and Kuhio
Highway near Hanalei is closed due to flooding. A river gage near
the Hanalei Bridge indicates water levels are still rising, but the
decrease in rainfall should lead to lowering water levels soon.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by heavy rain.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flooding in drainages, streams, rivers, roads,
properties, and other low-lying areas. Public road
closures possible in some areas. Landslides are possible
in steep terrain.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Princeville, Kilauea, Hanalei, Wainiha, Haena, Na Pali State Park
and Kalihiwai.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Stay away from streams, rivers, drainage ditches, and culverts, even
if they are currently dry.

foot. Turn around, don`t drown.</instruction>
