<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 30 at 1:19PM CST until January 31 at 3:00AM CST by NWS Saint Louis</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 AM CST TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow and sleet expected. Total snow and sleet
accumulations around one inch expected. Locally higher amounts are
possible.
* WHERE...Iron MO, Madison MO, and Reynolds MO Counties.
* WHEN...Until 3 AM CST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions will impact the Monday evening and Tuesday morning
commutes.</description>
<instruction>The rapid accumulation of snow and sleet will make travel extremely
difficult, if not impossible at times. If travel is necessary, be
sure to exercise extreme caution. If you must travel, keep an extra
flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency.
The latest road conditions can be obtained at traveler.modot.org/map
or by calling 1-888-275-6636.
It only takes a small amount of sleet to make roads, bridges,
sidewalks and parking lots icy and dangerous. Plan for a slow trip
and use caution when approaching turns, bridges and overpasses.
Remain alert for rapid changes in road conditions.
Those planning travel should be advised that visibilities will vary
greatly across the area, and weather conditions in rural areas will
be much worse than those in a nearby town or city. Do not be fooled,
if you are planning travel in an open area, make certain you and
your car are prepared for the elements. Although treated roads may
just be wet, untreated surfaces will be ice covered and very
slippery. Motorists should remain alert for rapid changes in road
conditions, especially when turning onto lesser travelled roads,
side streets, or parking lots.</instruction>
