<headline>Freeze Watch issued November 16 at 2:44PM CST until November 18 at 7:00AM CST by NWS Mobile</headline>
<description>...FREEZE WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Sub-freezing temperatures as low as 30 degrees possible.
* WHERE...In Alabama, Mobile Central and Baldwin Central
Counties. In Florida, Escambia Inland, Santa Rosa Inland and
Okaloosa Inland Counties.
* WHEN...From late Thursday night through Friday morning.
* IMPACTS...Frost and freeze conditions could kill crops, other
sensitive vegetation and possibly damage unprotected outdoor
plumbing.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...All locations to the north of the Watch
area will also likely freeze late Thursday night and early
Friday morning, but these locations have already had a
widespread freeze earlier in the fall and a Watch will not be
issued there as Freeze products are only issued for the initial
freeze of the year.
PRECAUTIONARY PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.
