<headline>Freezing Fog Advisory issued November 16 at 2:17AM PST until November 16 at 8:00AM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...AIR STAGNATION ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST
FRIDAY...
...FREEZING FOG ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM PST THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...For the Air Stagnation Advisory, stagnant air is
expected, which may lead to deteriorating air quality. For the
Freezing Fog Advisory, visibility of a quarter mile or less in
freezing fog.
* WHERE...Freezing fog will affect valley areas from Valley
Falls northward, including Paisley, Summer Lake, Silver Lake
and portions of highways 395, 31, and 20. Air stagnation will
affect valleys of Lake County, including Alkali Lake, Valley
Falls, Lakeview, Paisley, Summer Lake, and Silver Lake.
* WHEN...For the Air Stagnation Advisory, until 10 AM PST
Friday. For the Freezing Fog Advisory, until 8 AM PST this
morning.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous driving conditions due to low visibility
and potential frost on bridges. Air stagnation is likely to
result in diminishing air quality with time, especially in and
near areas with significant sources of air pollution.
Diminished air quality is likely to cause health issues for
people with respiratory problems if precautions are not taken.

https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/map/?wfo=mfr</description>
<instruction>If driving, slow down, use your headlights, and leave plenty of
distance ahead of you. Also, be alert for frost on bridge decks
causing slippery roads.
People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with diminished air quality. N95 masks are
effective at filtering out the majority of harmful air
particulates.
State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor
burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be
limited as much as possible. According to state air quality
agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants
close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with
your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
