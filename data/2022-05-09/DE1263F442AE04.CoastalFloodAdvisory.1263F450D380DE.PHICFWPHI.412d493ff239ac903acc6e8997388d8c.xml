<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued May 09 at 3:29AM EDT until May 09 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Philadelphia - Mount Holly</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Up to one half foot of inundation above ground level in
low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...Sussex County.
* WHEN...Until 8 PM EDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...At this level, flooding begins on the most
vulnerable roads in coastal and bayside communities, and along
inland tidal waterways. Some partial or full road closures are
possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The highest tide levels will occur around
the time of high tide which occurs this afternoon. However,
tidal flooding may linger on back bays even between high tide
cycles. Flooding impacts will likely be higher on back bays than
the ocean front. Minor tidal flooding may linger with the
Tuesday morning high tide.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>A Coastal Flood Advisory means that minor tidal flooding is
expected. Minor tidal flooding often results in some road
closures. Usually, the most vulnerable roadways will flood.
Do not leave your vehicle at a location that is prone to tidal
flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flood waters. The
water may be deeper than you think it is. You will be putting
yourself in danger and your vehicle may be damaged, leading to
costly repairs.
Visit the Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service at
water.weather.gov/ahps for additional water level and flood
impact information for your local tide gauge.</instruction>
