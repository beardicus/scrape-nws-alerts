<description>...EXPECT A PROLONGED PERIOD OF HIGH WATER AND FLOODING WITHIN
THE RAINY LAKE BASIN...
Spring snowmelt, record April precipitation and frequent May rain
events have created strong hydrologic responses within the Rainy
Lake basin.
Many tributaries to Rainy Lake continue showing strong inflows with
continued upward trends.  Rainy River tributaries have receded since
their crests in late April.
Strong lake rises within the Rainy Lake Basin are ongoing and are
expected to continue for at least the next week to ten days.
Snowpack still exists in the basin`s upland areas, and with warmer
temperatures and rainfall in the forecast expect increasing water
levels.
At 08:00 AM, Monday, May 9th the Namakan Lake level was 1118.6
feet. In 2014 the highest lake level was 1120 feet. A record level
was set on Lake Namakan in 1950 when it reached 1122.70 feet.
Maximum releases from dams on Namakan Lake and Rainy Lake continue
in an effort to slow surging lake rises.  This will cause an
increase in the flow on the Rainy River. Expect high water levels
within the Rainy Lake system for the next several weeks.
