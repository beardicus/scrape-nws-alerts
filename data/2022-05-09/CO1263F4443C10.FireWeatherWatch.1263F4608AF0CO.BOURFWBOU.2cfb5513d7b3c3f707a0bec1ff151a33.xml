<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued May 09 at 11:48AM MDT until May 10 at 9:00PM MDT by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>...Red flag warning for today across the Palmer Divide, South
Park, Denver metro area, and southern foothills for strong winds
and low humidity...
.A fire weather watch is in effect on Tuesday afternoon for much
of the same areas in north central Colorado. A repeat of fire
weather conditions is expected Tuesday in terms of winds and RH
during the afternoon hours, but there continues to be some
uncertainty in those conditions given a Denver Cyclone will be in
place during the afternoon which could lead to weak winds and
higher RH especialy along and west of I-25 across metro Denver.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY MORNING
THROUGH TUESDAY EVENING FOR WIND AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR
EASTERN PORTIONS OF ADAMS AND ARAPAHOE COUNTIES...
* Affected Area...Fire Weather Zone 245.
* Timing...From 11 am to 9 pm MDT on Tuesday.
* Winds...Southeast 15 to 25 mph with gusts up to 35 mph.
* Relative Humidity...As low as 13 percent.
* Impacts...Any fire that starts will have the potential to
spread rapidly. Avoid burning or any outdoor activity that may
produce a spark and start a wildfire.</description>
<instruction>A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are forecast to occur. Listen for later forecasts and possible
Red Flag Warnings.</instruction>
