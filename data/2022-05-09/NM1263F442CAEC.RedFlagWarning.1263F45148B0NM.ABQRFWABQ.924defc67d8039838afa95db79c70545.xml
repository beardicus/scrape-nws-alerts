temperatures will also persist into the middle of the week along

leading to rapid and potentially catastrophic fire spread and
growth. Winds will decrease tonight, but gusty winds will
redevelop over the eastern half of New Mexico Tuesday, leading to
another round of critical fire weather conditions.
