<headline>Red Flag Warning issued May 09 at 11:48AM MDT until May 09 at 7:00PM MDT by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>...Red flag warning for today across the Palmer Divide, South
Park, Denver metro area, and southern foothills for strong winds
and low humidity...
.A fire weather watch is in effect on Tuesday afternoon for much
of the same areas in north central Colorado. A repeat of fire
weather conditions is expected Tuesday in terms of winds and RH
during the afternoon hours, but there continues to be some
uncertainty in those conditions given a Denver Cyclone will be in
place during the afternoon which could lead to weak winds and
higher RH especialy along and west of I-25 across metro Denver.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM MDT THIS EVENING
FOR WIND AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR BOULDER AND JEFFERSON
COUNTIES...
* Affected Area...Fire Weather Zone 239.
* Timing...From 10 am to 9 pm MDT on Monday.
* Winds...West 15 to 20 mph with gusts up to 35 mph.
* Relative Humidity...As low as 9 percent.
* Impacts...Any fire that starts will have the potential to
spread rapidly. Avoid burning or any outdoor activity that may
produce a spark and start a wildfire.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now....or will shortly. A combination of
strong winds...low relative humidity...and warm temperatures can
contribute to extreme fire behavior.</instruction>
