<headline>Red Flag Warning issued May 09 at 11:48AM MDT until May 09 at 9:00PM MDT by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>...Red flag warning for today across the Palmer Divide, South
Park, Denver metro area, and southern foothills for strong winds
and low humidity...
.A fire weather watch is in effect on Tuesday afternoon for much
of the same areas in north central Colorado. A repeat of fire
weather conditions is expected Tuesday in terms of winds and RH
during the afternoon hours, but there continues to be some
uncertainty in those conditions given a Denver Cyclone will be in
place during the afternoon which could lead to weak winds and
higher RH especialy along and west of I-25 across metro Denver.

FOR WIND AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR LINCOLN AND EASTERN ELBERT
COUNTIES...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY MORNING

today.
* Winds...Southwest 15 to 25 mph with gusts up to 40 mph.

spread rapidly. Avoid burning or any outdoor activity that may
produce a spark and start a wildfire.</description>
