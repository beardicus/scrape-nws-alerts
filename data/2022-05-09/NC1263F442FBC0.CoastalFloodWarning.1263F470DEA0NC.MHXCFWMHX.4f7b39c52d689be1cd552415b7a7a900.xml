<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM EDT
THURSDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM EDT THURSDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, 2 to 4 feet of
inundation above ground level expected near vulnerable dune
structures. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves
of 10 to 15 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards
Statement, dangerous rip currents, large breaking waves
expected, and strong longshore currents in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Oceanside Outer Banks, north of Cape Hatteras.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, until 6 AM EDT Thursday.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Up to 2 to 4 feet of inundation above ground level
is possible for beach-adjacent properties and roadways,
resulting in a significant threat to life and property.
Numerous roads may be closed, including several sections of NC
12 on Hatteras Island. Low lying property including homes,
businesses, and some critical infrastructure will be
inundated. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
shoreline erosion will occur. Rip currents can sweep even the
best swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Dangerous
shore break can throw a swimmer or surfer head first into the
bottom causing neck and back injuries. Strong longshore
currents will create dangerous swimming conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...This will be a long duration event with
conditions deteriorating Sunday night and peaking Monday
through Wednesday, then gradually improving late in the week.
The greatest threat of ocean overwash and inundation will
occur around the times of high tide. Dune erosion will be
progressive and overwash will likely be worse with each
successive high tide.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
