<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM THIS MORNING TO 7 PM MST
THIS EVENING FOR GUSTY WINDS, LOW HUMIDITY AND VERY HIGH TO
EXTREME FIRE DANGER LEVEL FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONE 153 AND PARTS OF
ZONES 151, 152 AND 154...

of zone 152, all of zone 153 and the southeast half of zone 154.
* TIMING...From 11 am this morning until 7 pm this evening.
* WINDS...Widespread winds of 15 to 20 mph with local areas 20 to 25
mph. Afternoon gusts around 35 mph.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...Below 10 percent in the valleys and 10 to 15
percent in the mountains.

potential to spread rapidly and be difficult to control.
* FOR A DETAILED VIEW OF THE HAZARD AREA...Visit
weather.gov/Tucson and click on the Detailed Hazards Icon.</description>
<instruction>Winds are borderline critical, but given the very low humidity level
and the current fuel conditions the Red Flag warning was thought to
be prudent for this area.
A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now...or are expected to develop. A
combination of strong winds...low relative humidity...and dry
vegetation will create the potential for rapid and erratic fire
growth.
Please advise the appropriate officials or fire crews in the
field of the Red Flag Warning for portions of Southeast Arizona.</instruction>
