* IMPACTS...Frost and freeze conditions will kill crops, other
sensitive vegetation and possibly damage unprotected outdoor

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Extensive cloud cover and rainfall is
expected to prevent freezing conditions in areas not covered by
the Freeze Warning tonight into Tuesday morning. Cloud cover and
some air mass modification is expected to limit freezing
conditions Wednesday morning, as well, but stay tuned for
updates, because there is a greater spread in possible forecast
minimum temperatures for Wednesday morning.

<instruction>Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
