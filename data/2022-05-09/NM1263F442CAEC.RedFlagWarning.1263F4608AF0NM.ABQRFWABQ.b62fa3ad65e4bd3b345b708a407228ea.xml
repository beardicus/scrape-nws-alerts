<description>...LONG DURATION RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FOR THE NORTHEAST
HIGHLANDS AS WELL AS THE SANDIA, MANZANO, AND GALLINAS MOUNTAINS
THROUGH 9 PM MDT THIS EVENING DUE TO VERY STRONG WINDS, SEVERAL
HOURS OF SINGLE DIGIT HUMIDITY, ABOVE AVERAGE WARMTH AND AN
UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR ALL OTHER AREAS FROM
9 AM TO 9 PM MDT TODAY DUE TO STRONG WINDS, LOW HUMIDITY, ABOVE
AVERAGE WARMTH AND AN UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FOR THE CENTRAL MOUNTAIN CHAIN
EASTWARD TO THE EASTERN PLAINS OF NEW MEXICO FROM 11 AM TO 9 PM
MDT TUESDAY DUE TO STRONG WINDS, LOW HUMIDITY, ABOVE NORMAL
TEMPERATURES AND AN UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
.A dire and critical to extreme fire weather event continues.
This long duration of strong, gusty and potentially damaging winds
will continue today along with exceptionally low afternoon
humidity and poor overnight humidity recoveries. Above normal
temperatures will also persist into the middle of the week along
with high Haines indices that will yield very unstable conditions
leading to rapid and potentially catastrophic fire spread and
growth. Winds will decrease tonight, but gusty winds will
redevelop over the eastern half of New Mexico Tuesday, leading to
another round of critical fire weather conditions.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM MDT THIS
EVENING...
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM TO 9 PM MDT TUESDAY...
The National Weather Service in Albuquerque has issued a Red Flag

Fire Weather Watch for Tuesday is no longer in effect.
* AREA AND TIMING...Sandia, Manzano and Gallinas Mountains through
9PM MDT this evening. The most critical fire weather conditions
will be during the morning through early afternoon. Critical
conditions are expected to redevelop late Tuesday morning
through early evening.
* 20 FOOT WINDS...Southwest winds of 30 to 40 mph with
occasional gusts of 55 to 65 mph on today and Monday. South
southwest winds of 20 to 25 mph with occasional gusts to 35 mph.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...Ranging from 6 to 10 percent each day with
long durations of single digit relative humidities. Poor

possible. Outdoor burning should not be done.</description>
