Minnesota, including the following counties, in north central
Minnesota, Koochiching. In northeast Minnesota, Lake and St. Louis.
* WHEN...Until 400 PM CDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lakes, rivers, and other low-lying and
flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring. Several structures

Low-water crossings are inundated with water and may not be
passable. Expect many areas of slow moving or standing water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 232 PM CDT, Emergency management reported ongoing
extensive flooding.
- Thunderstorms brought 1 to 4 inches of new rainfall to the
Rainy River Basin over the holiday weekend. While mostly dry
weather is expected this week, rises will likely continue.
Namakan and Kabetogama Lakes were at 1122.2 feet as of May
30, which is 20.5 inches above the peak level set in 2014.
The level of Namakan Lake is expected to rise another 2 to 3
inches in the next few days before it may begin to crest and
fall early next week.
Rainy Lake was at 1112.4 feet as of May 30, 12 inches above
the 2014 flooding peak and only 7 inches away from the record
level set in 1950. Rainy Lake is expected to rise another 8
to 11 inches over the next week, breaking the 1950 record. A
peak is unlikely before mid-June on Rainy Lake.

International Falls, Winton, Kabetogama, Crane Lake, Buyck,
Voyageurs National Park, Rainy Lake East, Kabetogama Lake,
Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Near Trout Lake,

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Once levels have peaked, it will take a matter of weeks to a month
for levels to decline to near normal summer levels. Additional
rainfall will prolong the time it takes for levels to recede.</instruction>
