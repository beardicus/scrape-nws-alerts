<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued May 31 at 8:35PM MDT until June 01 at 12:00PM MDT by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>...SNOW IN THE MOUNTAINS TONIGHT ESPECIALLY WEST OF DENVER...
.A wet spring storm system will bring snow to much of the northern
Colorado mountains tonight into Wednesday morning. The heaviest snow
is expected to be over the higher foothills and mountains from
Boulder county south across Gilpin, Clear Creek and northern
Jefferson counties. A band of moderate to heavy snow is expected to
be stalled over this area with little movement through the night
tonight. The snow is expected to diminish Wednesday morning.
The snow level is expected to remain around 7000 feet, with
significant accumulations limited to areas above 7500 or 8000 feet.
Temperatures will be near or just below freezing at higher
elevations, which means bridges could become slick when the rest of
the roadways are wet. Road conditions should improve after sunrise
Wednesday morning with more sun, warming temperatures, and lighter
snow.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON MDT
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 4 to 12 inches.
* WHERE...Rocky Mountain National Park and the Medicine Bow Range,
and The Mountains of Summit County, the Mosquito Range, and the
Indian Peaks.
* WHEN...Until Noon MDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Roads will likely become slick and hazardous, especially
late this evening and overnight. I-70 east of the Eisenhower
Tunnel and US 40 east of Berthoud Pass as well as rural roads in
Gilpin and Clear Creek counties are most vulnerable.  Slick roads
may persist for the Wednesday morning commute.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling. The latest road
conditions for Colorado can be obtained by calling 5 1 1 or by going
to www.cotrip.org.
Chain and traction laws will possibly be enacted for the mountains.
If traveling to the mountains, be prepared for winter driving
conditions.</instruction>
