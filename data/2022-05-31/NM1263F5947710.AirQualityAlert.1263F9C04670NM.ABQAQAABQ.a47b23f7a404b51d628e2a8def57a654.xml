<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT...
The following message is transmitted at the request of the New Mexico
Departments of Health and Environment, United States Forest Service
and the Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality Response Program.
* WHAT...Smoke from active or new fires will generally be carried
toward the northeast this afternoon; however, lighter transport
winds will overall result in less smoke aloft downwind from the
largest fires as compared to the past several days. Easterly
transport winds will develop behind a backdoor cold front that will
slowly advance toward the south and west late tonight into Wednesday
with a reinforcing surge of east northeast winds Wednesday evening.
This change in the wind pattern will shift the focus for smoke
impacts from the Hermits Peak and Calf Canyon fire farther west and
southwest. Relatively moist easterly winds will eventually reach the
Continental Divide by late Wednesday, and significant smoke impacts
should become much more localized going into Thursday and Friday
and mainly focused in close proximity to the Black fire.
* WHERE...Air quality may become unhealthy at times, in close
proximity to the Black fire. Elsewhere, deteriorating air quality
may be encountered in the vicinity of Penasco, Pecos, Glorieta,
Santa Fe, Eldorado and portions of the Espanola valley and Gallisteo
Basin late tonight and Wednesday morning as residual smoke gets
pushed west and southwestward. However, impacts here, if any, should
be mostly moderate though residents should be prepared for
changeable conditions around daybreak Wednesday. Light surface smoke
may settle into portions of the Tularosa Basin and the Highway 380
corridor between San Antonio and Bingham tonight. There may also be
increased haze or light smoke aloft for the Middle Rio Grande Valley
and Estancia Basin the next 24 hours. More details on impacted
locations and latest air quality information can be found at
https://fire.airnow.gov.
* WHEN...Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1 pm MDT
Wednesday, June 1.
* IMPACTS...Those with conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and heart
disease will be especially vulnerable to impacts from poor air
quality, as will adults over age 65, young children, and pregnant
women if smoke concentrations become unhealthy.
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method available
at https://nmtracking.doh.nm.gov/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
https://nmtracking.doh.nm.gov/environment/air/IndoorQuality.html and
https://cv.nmhealth.org
New Mexicans will also need to take steps to keep their homes cool to
avoid heat-related illnesses. NMDOH offers tips here:
