<description>...SNOW IN THE MOUNTAINS TONIGHT ESPECIALLY WEST OF DENVER...
.A wet spring storm system will bring snow to much of the northern
Colorado mountains tonight into Wednesday morning. The heaviest snow
is expected to be over the higher foothills and mountains from
Boulder county south across Gilpin, Clear Creek and northern
Jefferson counties. A band of moderate to heavy snow is expected to
be stalled over this area with little movement through the night
tonight. The snow is expected to diminish Wednesday morning.
The snow level is expected to remain around 7000 feet, with
significant accumulations limited to areas above 7500 or 8000 feet.
Temperatures will be near or just below freezing at higher
elevations, which means bridges could become slick when the rest of
the roadways are wet. Road conditions should improve after sunrise
Wednesday morning with more sun, warming temperatures, and lighter
snow.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON MDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Wet snow ongoing. Additional snow accumulations of 4 to 8
inches above 7500 feet, with little or no snow at lower elevations.
* WHERE...The Southern Front Range Foothills.
* WHEN...Until Noon MDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Snow or slush covered roads will make travel hazardous
at times in the higher foothills areas including Interstate 70
west of Evergreen. Bridges and overpasses may also become icy.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling. Be prepared for variable
conditions and check the latest road conditions by calling 5 1 1 or
by going to www.cotrip.org.</instruction>
