of Lockport.
HAZARD...Winds in excess of 40 mph and pea size hail.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around
unsecured objects. Minor damage to outdoor objects is
possible.

Medina, Albion, Newfane, Middleport, Waterport, Lakeside Beach State
Park, Point Breeze, Kent, Ridgeway, Gaines, Kendall, Wilson,
Lyndonville, Barker, Olcott, Ransomville, Knowlesville, Model City,
