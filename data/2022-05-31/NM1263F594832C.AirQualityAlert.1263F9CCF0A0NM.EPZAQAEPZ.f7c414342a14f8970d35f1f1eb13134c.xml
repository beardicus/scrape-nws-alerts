<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM MDT WEDNESDAY...
The New Mexico Departments of Health and Environment has issued an
Air Quality Alert, until 1 PM MDT Wednesday.
An Air Quality Alert for Smoke has been issued.
* WHAT... Smoke from active or new fires will generally be carried
toward the northeast this afternoon; however, lighter transport
winds will result in less smoke aloft downwind from the largest
fires as compared to the past several days. Easterly transport
winds will develop behind a backdoor cold front that will slowly
advance toward the south and west late tonight into Wednesday with
a reinforcing surge of east-northeast winds Wednesday evening. This
change in the wind pattern will shift the focus for smoke impacts
from the Hermits Peak Calf Canyon fire farther west and southwest.
The relatively moist easterly winds eventually reaching the
Continental Divide by late Wednesday. Significant smoke impacts
should become much more localized going into Thursday and Friday
and mainly focused in close proximity to the Black fire.
* WHERE... Air quality may become unhealthy, at times, in close
proximity to the Black fire including Winston, Chloride and
neighboring communities along the Mimbres and Lower Rio Grande
Valleys. Localized impacts are also expected in the vicinity of the
Foster fire in the Bootheel. Elsewhere, deteriorating air quality
may be encountered in the vicinity of Peasco, Pecos, Glorieta,
Santa Fe, Eldorado and portions of the Espanola Valley and Galisteo
Basin late tonight and Wednesday morning as residual smoke gets
pushed west and southwestward. However, impacts here, if any,
should be mostly moderate though residents should be prepared for
changeable conditions around daybreak Wednesday. Light surface
smoke may settle into portions of the Tularosa Basin and the
Highway 380 corridor between San Antonio and Bingham tonight. There
may also be increased haze or light smoke aloft for the Middle Rio
Grande Valley and Estancia Basin next 24 hours. More details on
impacted locations and latest air quality information can be found
at https://fire.airnow.gov
* WHEN... Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1pm MDT
Wednesday, June 1.</description>
