<description>...Rain and snow band moving through northern Nevada...
A band of rain and snow will move through the state from west to
east through the late afternoon and early evening hours.
Precipitation could start out as rain in some valleys before
quickly turning to snow as slightly colder air moves in as the day
progresses. Brief heavy snow and some areas of blowing snow are
possible which could cause roadways to deteriorate with rapid
accumulation of snow. 1 to 2 inches of snow are expected with
heavier amounts along passes and higher elevation roadways. This
includes portions of I-80 east of Winnemucca to Wendover as well
as SR-225, portions of US-93 and SR-227. Precipitation will
diminish late this afternoon into the evening hours along with the
potential for refreezing of roadway moisture overnight.
Weather conditions will improve tonight into Wednesday as the
storm system exits the region.
Motorists should remain alert to quickly changing weather and
road conditions, and reduce speeds over snow covered roadways.
