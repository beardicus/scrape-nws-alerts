<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 10 at 12:49PM PST until January 11 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM PST
WEDNESDAY...
* CHANGES...Updated additional snowfall amounts based on snow
shower bands.
* WHAT...Snow showers with bands of heavy snow. Additional snow
accumulations of 3 to 7 inches, with 7 to 14 inches with bands
of heavier snow. Wind gusts up to 50 mph with ridgetop gusts in
excess of 100 mph at times.
* WHERE...Mono County.
* WHEN...Until 4 AM PST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible, with
potential for avalanches producing extended road closures. The
series of winter storms since late December has made snow
removal more challenging, with limited areas for holding the
plowed snow. A few lightning strikes are possible near the
Sierra crest.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Bands of snow showers continue through this
evening, with whiteout conditions possible within heavier snow
bands. Watch for rapid changes in visibility and road
conditions, especially after sunset.</description>
<instruction>Avoid travel if possible, you could be stuck in your vehicle for
many hours. If you must travel, prepare for long delays and carry
an emergency kit with extra food, water and clothing. If you stay
home, have a backup plan in case of power outages.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
