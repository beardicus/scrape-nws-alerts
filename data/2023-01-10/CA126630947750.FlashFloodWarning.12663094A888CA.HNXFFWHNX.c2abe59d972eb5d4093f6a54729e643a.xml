<instruction>This is a life threatening situation for people in the KNP Complex
burn area. Heavy rainfall will cause extensive and severe flash
flooding of creeks, streams, and ditches. Severe debris flows can
also be anticipated across roads. Roadways and bridges may be washed
away in places. Stay off the roads in the warned area. If you
encounter flood waters, climb to safety
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.</instruction>
