<headline>High Wind Watch issued January 07 at 2:53PM PST until January 09 at 7:00PM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH
TUESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Southwest winds 35 to 45 mph with gusts up to 60 mph
possible.
* WHERE...In California, Modoc County, the Warner Mountains. In
Oregon, Eastern Klamath County and most of Lake County.
* WHEN...From Tuesday morning through Tuesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be difficult due to blowing snow
causing whiteout conditions. High profile vehicles may also
observe difficult driving conditions in cross winds. Damaging
winds could blow down trees and power lines. Power outages are
possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The highest confidence for warning level
winds is the terrain above 5500 feet. However, even valley
locations have a very high chance (80% +) for at least advisory
strength wind gusts (45-57 mph). Snow impactful to driving
conditions (1-5 inches) is also expected on Tuesday and so
winter weather headlines may be combined with the wind hazard in
future updates.

<instruction>Monitor the latest forecasts and warnings for updates on this
situation. Dangerous driving conditions are possible, especially
if operating a high profile vehicle. Downed trees and power lines
are possible. Fasten loose objects or shelter objects in a safe
location prior to the onset of winds.</instruction>
