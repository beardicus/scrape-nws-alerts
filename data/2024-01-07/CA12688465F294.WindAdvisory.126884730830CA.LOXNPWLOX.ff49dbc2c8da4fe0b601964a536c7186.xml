...HARD FREEZE WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH
MONDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...For the Wind Advisory, north winds 15 to 25 mph with
gusts up to 40 mph expected. For the Hard Freeze Watch, sub-
freezing temperatures as low as 24 degrees are possible.
* WHERE...Cuyama Valley.
* WHEN...For the Wind Advisory, until 7 PM PST this evening. For
the Hard Freeze Watch, from late tonight through Monday

* IMPACTS...Gusty winds will blow around unsecured objects and
make driving difficult, especially for drivers of high profile

freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly.</instruction>
