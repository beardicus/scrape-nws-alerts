<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 07 at 2:48PM PST until January 10 at 4:00PM PST by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...BLIZZARD CONDITIONS EXPECTED FOR THE CASCADE PASSES AND ABOVE
TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY...
.OVERVIEW...The heaviest snow so far this season is on its way to
the Cascades after a strong cold front sweeps across the Pacific
Northwest Monday night, ushering in much colder air and more
seasonable snow levels for Tuesday. Strong and deep onshore flow
will lead to periods of heavy snow, strong winds, and near zero
visibility for the Cascades, especially for exposed areas above
3500 feet. This has prompted us to issue a rare Blizzard Warning
for the Cascade passes and above, with Winter Storm Warnings
extending as low as 1500 to 2000 feet in the Cascade foothills. By
the time snow showers decrease Wednesday, elevations 3000 feet and
above will likely be measuring their snow in feet, rather than
inches.
...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM TUESDAY TO 4 PM PST
WEDNESDAY ABOVE 1500 FEET...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected above 1500 feet. Total snow
accumulations of 6 to 24 inches, heaviest above 2000 feet.
* WHERE...In Oregon, Northern Oregon Cascade Foothills. In
Washington, South Washington Cascade Foothills.
* WHEN...From 4 AM Tuesday to 4 PM PST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Patchy blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility. Gusty winds could bring
down tree branches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...After a mild and breezy Monday evening,
snow levels will plummet behind a strong cold front Tuesday
morning, lowering to 1500 to 2000 feet by midday.</description>
