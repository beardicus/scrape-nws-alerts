<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 07 at 3:05AM CST until January 10 at 6:00AM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...A Winter Storm Watch is in effect for parts of northeast Iowa
and southwest Wisconsin from Monday night into Tuesday night...
.A storm system will produce a heavy band of snow across parts of
eastern Iowa, northern Illinois, and southern Wisconsin from
Monday night into Tuesday night. At this time, it looks like this
band could potentially produce 5 to 10 inches of snow across
Clayton and Fayette counties in northeast Iowa and Grant County in
southwest Wisconsin. With the track of this system still
uncertain, these totals could still change. A shift in the track
to the northwest would likely increase these snow totals.
Meanwhile, a shift in the track to the southwest would lower them.
In addition to the snow, the north and northwest winds will be
increasing into the 20 to 30 mph range with wind gusts up to
40 mph late Tuesday afternoon and continue into Tuesday night.
This will result in blowing and drifting snow.
...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY EVENING THROUGH
TUESDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 5 to 10
inches possible. Winds could gust as high as 40 mph from late
Tuesday afternoon through Tuesday night. This would result in
blowing and drifting snow.
* WHERE...In Iowa, Fayette and Clayton Counties. In Wisconsin,
Grant County.
* WHEN...From Monday evening through Tuesday night.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute.</description>
