THROUGH EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Moderate snow and strong winds possible. Total snow

could gust as high as 35 MPH in the valleys and 50 MPH near
mountain peaks.
* WHERE...The Central Mountains west of Challis and Mackay, the
Wood River Valley, and Wood River foothills, including but not
limited to Banner Summit, Stanley, Galena Summit, Ketchum, Sun
Valley, Hailey, Bellevue, and Picabo.
* WHEN...From early Tuesday morning through early Wednesday
morning. The worst conditions are expected Tuesday afternoon
into late Tuesday night.

winds could make travel very difficult, including for the
Tuesday evening commute. Blowing and drifting snow could
significantly reduce visibility and make it harder than usual
for transportation crews to keep roads clear.</description>
