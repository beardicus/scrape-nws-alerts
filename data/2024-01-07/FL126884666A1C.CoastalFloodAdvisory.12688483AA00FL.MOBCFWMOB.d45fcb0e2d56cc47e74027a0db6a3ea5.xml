Advisory, from 6 PM Monday to 6 AM CST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only isolated

jetties and docks, and into dangerous seas. Life- threatening
swimming conditions and significant beach erosion can be
expected. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...If trends in winds continue, a coastal
flood warning may be needed for moderate coastal flooding.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other waterside
infrastructure.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
