<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM PST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Light to moderate snow is expected through this morning
before tampering off by this afternoon. Additional snowfall
accumulation of a dusting to an inch is possible through late
this morning. Gusty northwest winds of 25 to 40 mph with gusts
to 60 mph and localized gusts to 70 mph will continue through
early this evening.
* WHERE...Northern Ventura County Mountains and Interstate 5
Corridor in LA county mountains.
* WHEN...Until 7 PM PST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult due to low
visibilities and snow/ice covered roads with localized
blizzard conditions likely. Very strong winds may cause
extensive tree damage. Interstate 5 near the Grapevine will
likely become hazardous for driving tonight into Sunday
morning due to the combination of snow, ice, and strong winds
which may cause delays or closure.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow will likely come to a end by this
afternoon, but strong winds will continue to cause reduced
visibility at times due to blowing snow through this evening.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
