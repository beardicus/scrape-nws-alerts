<headline>Rip Current Statement issued January 07 at 2:09PM EST until January 11 at 12:00AM EST by NWS Tallahassee</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH WEDNESDAY
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH
LATE TUESDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
For the Coastal Flood Watch, minor to moderate coastal flooding
possible.
* WHERE...Coastal Franklin County.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Wednesday
evening. For the Coastal Flood Watch, from Tuesday morning
through late Tuesday night.
* IMPACTS...Water levels could be highest around the time of high
tide, particularly east of Carrabelle where the high tide is
closer to midday. Water could overwash coastal roads and even
impact non-elevated structures in flood prone areas like
Alligator Point and Saint Teresa. Some shoreline erosion may
occur. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from
shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
