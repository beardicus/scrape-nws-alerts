* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Forecast rainfall for Tuesday into Wednesday has widespread
total amounts of 2 to 3 inches with localized amounts of 4
inches possible. The ground remains quite saturated following
multiple rounds of heavy rainfall over the last few weeks. A
period of higher hourly rainfall rates is possible during the
overnight hours Tuesday night which would enhance the
potential risk for flooding, particularly in urban areas.
Runoff due to snowmelt from this past weekend`s storm as well
as tidal inundation in coastal areas may also exacerbate any
flooding due to heavy rainfall.
