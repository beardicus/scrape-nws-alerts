<description>...SNOW SHOWERS WITH LOW VISIBILITY MOVING IN...
Snow showers were moving southwest toward Red Cliff, Bayfield, and
Sand Bay this afternoon and will quickly reduce the visibility
to a quarter to half mile. A quick half to one inch of snow is
possible in these areas as these stronger snow showers move in
between 320 and 350 PM. It`s possible a Snow Squall Warning may be
needed for very low visibilities.
Be prepared for low visibility. This could lead to temporary
whiteout conditions and the potential for dangerous driving
conditions. If you are traveling and encounter adverse winter
driving conditions...reduce speed and make sure headlights are on.</description>
