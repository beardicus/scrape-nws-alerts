County.
* WHEN...For the Air Stagnation Advisory, until 10 PM PST Friday.

* IMPACTS...Hazardous driving conditions due to low visibility
especially along and near the river bottoms. Air stagnation
could result in the development and persistence of poor air
quality.

<instruction>If driving, slow down, use your headlights, and leave plenty of
distance ahead of you.
People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with high levels of air pollution during
periods of stagnant air.
State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor
burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be
limited as much as possible. According to state air quality
agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants
close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with
your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
