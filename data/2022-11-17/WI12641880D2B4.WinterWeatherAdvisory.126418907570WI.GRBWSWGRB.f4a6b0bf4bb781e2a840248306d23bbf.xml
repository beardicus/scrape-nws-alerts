<description>...LAKE-EFFECT SNOW SHOWERS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN HAZARDOUS TRAVEL
CONDITIONS IN THE SNOWBELT LATE TODAY INTO FRIDAY MORNING...
.Occasional light snow and flurries will continue today. Heavier
lake-effect snow showers will begin to affect the area during the
late afternoon hours, continue overnight, and then diminish Friday
morning.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM THIS
AFTERNOON TO 9 AM CST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Periods of snow showers. A total snow accumulation ranging
from of 3 to 6 inches in the snowbelt of northern Vilas county...
to a couple inches in the Eagle River area.
* WHERE...Vilas County.
* WHEN...From 4 PM this afternoon to 9 AM CST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the Friday morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...An intense snow band with snowfall rates of
over one inch per hour is likely to be embedded within the larger
area of lake-effect snow showers. The best estimate is that the
band will primarily affect areas north and west of Vilas county.
However, anyone with travel plans tonight or Friday morning should
closely monitor later forecasts, because snowfall totals will need
to be increased substantially if the band sets up farther
southeast and lingers over Vilas county.</description>
