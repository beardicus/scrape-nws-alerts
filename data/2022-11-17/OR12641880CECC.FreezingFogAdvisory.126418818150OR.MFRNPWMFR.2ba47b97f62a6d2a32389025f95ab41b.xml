<headline>Freezing Fog Advisory issued November 17 at 4:43AM PST until November 17 at 9:00AM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...FREEZING FOG ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM PST THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...For the Freezing Fog Advisory, visibility of a half mile
or less in freezing fog.
* WHERE...Freezing fog will affect areas along highway 62 east of
Crater Lake to Chiloquin, including the Fort Klamath area.
* WHEN...For the Freezing Fog Advisory, until 9 AM PST this
morning.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous driving conditions due to low visibility and
potential frost and slippery conditions on roadways.
* View the hazard area in detail at
https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/map/?wfo=mfr</description>
<instruction>* If possible, wait for temperatures to warm above freezing
before traveling.
* Slow down and give 3 times as much space as normal between
vehicles.
* Shaded areas may be more slippery than unshaded areas.
* Use low beams. High beams reflect back fog making visibility
worse for you and other drivers.
* Fog makes objects appear farther away than they are.
* Be ready for low visibility by keeping your headlights clean.
* Don`t use cruise control. Most crashes occur because the
driver is going too fast for weather conditions.</instruction>
