<description>...LAKE-EFFECT SNOW SHOWERS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN HAZARDOUS TRAVEL
CONDITIONS IN THE SNOWBELT LATE THIS AFTERNOON INTO FRIDAY MORNING...
.Occasional light snow and flurries will continue early this
afternoon. Heavier lake-effect snow showers will begin to affect the
area during the late afternoon hours, continue overnight, and then
diminish Friday morning.
...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM CST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Periods of snow showers, heavy at times. A total snow
accumulation ranging from of 4 to 10 inches in the snowbelt of
northern and western Vilas county...to a couple inches in the
Eagle River area.
* WHERE...Vilas County.
* WHEN...Until 9 AM CST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on snow covered and slippery road conditions. The
hazardous conditions will impact the Friday morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...An intense snow band with snowfall rates of
over one inch per hour is likely to be embedded within the larger
area of lake-effect snow showers. The best estimate is that the
band will primarily affect areas north and west of Vilas county.
There remains some uncertainty where the heaviest snow band will
set up, so anyone with travel plans tonight or Friday morning
should closely monitor later forecasts for updates.</description>
