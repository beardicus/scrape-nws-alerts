<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued December 28 at 9:20PM PST until December 31 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE
SATURDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Sneaker waves possible.
* WHERE...In Oregon, North Oregon Coast and Central Oregon
Coast. In Washington, South Washington Coast.
* WHEN...Through late Saturday night.
* IMPACTS...Waves can run up significantly farther on a beach
than normal, including over rocks and jetties. Sneaker waves
can suddenly knock people off of their feet and quickly pull
them into the frigid ocean which may lead to serious injury or
drowning.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...High surf continues to be a possibility,
but higher waves will slowly subside.</description>
<instruction>Keep children and pets away from the surf zone. Keep off of
jetties, rocks and logs near the surf zone. If you see someone
swept into the sea do not swim in after them. Call 911 and keep an
eye on them until help arrives.
Remain out of the water to avoid hazardous swimming conditions.</instruction>
