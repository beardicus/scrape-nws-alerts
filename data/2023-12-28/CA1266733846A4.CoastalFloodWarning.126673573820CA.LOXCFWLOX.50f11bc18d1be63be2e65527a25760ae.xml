<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued December 28 at 7:21PM PST until December 30 at 10:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST
SATURDAY...
...HIGH SURF WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking
waves of 10 to 15 feet and local sets up to 20 feet with life-
threatening rip currents. For the Coastal Flood Warning,
significant coastal flooding expected.
* WHERE...Ventura County Beaches.
* WHEN...Until 10 PM PST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Significant flooding of sea water is likely over
vulnerable low-lying coastal areas around the time of high
tide. Damage to coastal roadways and structures is possible.
Powerful waves and strong rip currents will pose an
exceptional risk of ocean drowning and damage to coastal
structures like piers and jetties. Large breaking waves can
cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize
small boats near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Each morning through Saturday, residual
high tides of 6.0 to 6.5 feet will enhance the coastal
flooding risk.</description>
<instruction>Stay off of beaches and coastal walkways, roads, and structures.
Do NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other water side
infrastructure.</instruction>
