<headline>High Surf Advisory issued December 28 at 7:21PM PST until December 30 at 10:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST
SATURDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, moderate coastal flooding
expected. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 7
to 12 feet with dangerous rip currents. Local sets of 15 to 20
feet will be likely across west-facing beaches near Point
Conception.
* WHERE...Santa Barbara County Southwestern Coast and Santa
Barbara County Southeastern Coast.
* WHEN...Until 10 PM PST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely, around the time of
high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as
parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to
roads or structures is NOT expected. There is an increased
risk for ocean drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers and
surfers out to sea. Large breaking waves can cause injury,
wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats
near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Each morning through Saturday, residual
high tides of 6.0 to 6.5 feet will enhance the coastal
flooding risk.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
