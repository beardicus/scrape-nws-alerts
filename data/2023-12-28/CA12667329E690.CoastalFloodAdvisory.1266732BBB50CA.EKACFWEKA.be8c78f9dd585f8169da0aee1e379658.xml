<description>...HIGH SURF WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM PST THIS
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM THIS
MORNING TO 1 PM PST THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking
waves 28 to 32 feet. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, High
astronomical tides will cause minor flooding in low lying
areas along the Humboldt Bay. Up to one quarter foot of
saltwater inundation above ground level is possible in low
lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways (Between 8.8
and 9.0 feet MLLW at the North Spit tide gauge).
* WHERE...Northern Humboldt Coast County.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Warning, from 8 PM this evening to 8
PM PST Thursday. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 11 AM to
1 PM PST Thursday.. .
* IMPACTS...Breaking waves can sweep people off jetties and docks,
and into dangerous seas. Life-threatening surfing conditions and
significant beach erosion can be expected. These tides will
likely impact Jackson Ranch Road in the Arcata Bottoms and low
lying roads in King Salmon.</description>
<instruction>A Coastal Flood Advisory indicates that onshore winds and tides
will combine to generate flooding of low areas along the shore.
Feet Above Ground is locally defined as feet above the Highest
Astronomical Tide or HAT.
Large breaking waves along the coast will lead to increased wave
run-up on beaches with waves topping and washing over large rocks
and jetties. These large waves can be erratic and unpredictable.
Use extra caution near the surf zone as these large waves will be
capable of sweeping people into the frigid and turbulent ocean
water. Mariners traversing the bar are urged to exercise extreme
caution or stay in port until the threat subsides. Please contact
the U.S. Coast Guard for information regarding harbor and bar
closures.</instruction>
