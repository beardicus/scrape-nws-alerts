<headline>High Surf Warning issued December 28 at 7:21PM PST until December 30 at 10:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST SATURDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, moderate coastal flooding
expected. For the High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking
waves of 8 to 13 feet with maximum sets of 15 to 20 feet and
dangerous rip currents. Highest surf will be likely across west-
facing beaches such as Hermosa, Manhattan, and Palos Verdes
Beaches.
* WHERE...Catalina and Santa Barbara Islands, Malibu Coast and
Los Angeles County Beaches.
* WHEN...Until 10 PM PST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely, around the time of
high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as
parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to
roads or structures is NOT expected. There is an increased
risk for ocean drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers and
surfers out to sea. Large breaking waves can cause injury,
wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats
near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Each morning through Saturday, residual
high tides of 6.0 to 6.5 feet will enhance the coastal
flooding risk.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other water side
infrastructure.</instruction>
