<description>...RISES ON STREAMS AND RIVERS WILL CONTINUE DUE TO SNOWMELT
AND PRECIPITATIOON...
Streams and rivers emanating from the mountains will continue to see
rises over the weekend. The low in California is sending wrap around
precipitation into the region along with already warm temperatures.
Given above normal snowpack and added precipitation, will lead to
rises in streams and rivers with several gauges forecasted to meet
or exceed bankfull over the weekend. John Day River at at Service
Creek is expected to go to moderate by Saturday and will continue to
be monitored. The Naches at Naches and Cliffdell &amp; Naches, Grande
Ronde at Troy, Imnaha at Imnaha have already risen above bankfull
and are expected to reach minor flood stage over the weekend. Yakima
River at Umtanum &amp; Kiona and the Grande Ronde at Perry as well as
North Fork at John Day are expected to reach action stage over the
weekend. Widespread flooding is currently not anticipated.
This Hydrologic Outlook will be updated again each afternoon with
any pertinent updates concerning the latest flood forecast.</description>
