<description>...RISES TO CREEKS, STREAMS, AND RIVERS DUE TO INCREASED
SNOWMELT...
Streams, creeks, and rivers will continue to experience elevated
flows through the remainder of the workweek, especially low and
mid elevation watersheds across the forecast area. Waterways will
be extremely dangerous, running high, fast, and cold, increasing
the risk of hypothermia and drowning with even brief periods of
time in the water. Keep a safe distance from these waterways as
banks may become unstable, and especially monitor children and
pets closely as they can quickly drown in these elevated flows.
Isolated flooding has occurred, and will continue to occur over
the next two days. Many other mid-elevation watersheds will
continue to run high, fast, and cold with flows approaching, or
remaining near, bankfull conditions.
High pressure that has caused recent warm temperatures and
increased snowmelt has moved off to the east, however, flows will
remain elevated for the next two days. Given record snowpack in
our area mountains, recent warm temperatures will yield continued
snowmelt of low and mid-elevation basins, leading to the high
flows mentioned above. A low pressure system moving into the
region will bring cooler temperatures from Thursday on into the
weekend, resulting in decreased snowmelt.
Continue to monitor conditions closely as the spring snowmelt-
runoff has now begun in earnest. Stay tuned for the latest river
forecasts, watches, and warnings. Refer to those already issued
for additional information.</description>
