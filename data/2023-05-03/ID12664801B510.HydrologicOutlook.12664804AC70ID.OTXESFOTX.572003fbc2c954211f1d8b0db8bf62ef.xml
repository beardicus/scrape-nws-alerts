<description>...Unseasonably warm temperatures, snowmelt and additional rainfall
to continue rises on many rivers and creeks in the region...
Very warm temperatures will continue the snow melt and runoff into
area rivers and streams. River rises and increased flows will
continue through the week. In addition, any thunderstorms that
develop through Thursday will be capable of producing heavy rain
which may further result in river rises. Thunderstorms may also
produce localized debris flows in steep terrain, especially near
burn scars. Urban areas as well as locations with poor drainage will
also be susceptible to flooding.
Late Thursday and through Friday, an area of moderate to heavy rain
has the potential to bring more rises to creeks and rivers. Several
rivers are forecast to reach bankfull this week or next weekend,
including the Moyie and Spokane Rivers. The Kettle River and Coeur
d`Alene River are also expected to reach their flood stage this week.</description>
