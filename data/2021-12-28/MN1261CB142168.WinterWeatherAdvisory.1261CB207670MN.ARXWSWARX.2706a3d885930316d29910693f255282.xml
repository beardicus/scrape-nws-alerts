<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 28 at 4:18PM CST until December 28 at 9:00PM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Accumulating Snow has Shifted Into Wisconsin, but Changing over
to Freezing Drizzle...
.Snow reports have varied from 2 to as much as 5 inches across
much of the area this afternoon. The back edge of the accumulating
snowfall is quickly moving to the east and has ended in southeast
Minnesota and northeast Iowa. There have been reports of freezing
drizzle as the snow leaves the area.
In central and western Wisconsin, visibilities will remain poor at
times and most roads across the entire region are snow covered and
slippery. Expect a slower evening commute.
With the lingering freezing precipitation we will extend the
advisory a few more hours west of the Mississippi River.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM CST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Snow transitioning to freezing drizzle. Additional snow
accumulations up to an inch.
* WHERE...Portions of southwest and west central Wisconsin,
northeast Iowa and southeast Minnesota.
* WHEN...Until 9 PM CST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions will impact the evening commute.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
For the latest road conditions, check 511ia.org in Iowa,
511mn.org in Minnesota, and 511wi.gov in Wisconsin.</instruction>
