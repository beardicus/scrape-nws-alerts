<instruction>Prepare immediately for DAMAGING WINDS and HAIL, as well as deadly

on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. Stay away from windows.

ponding of water on roadways, standing water in low lying areas, and
minor flooding of creeks, streams, and areas of poor drainage.
Drivers are urged to slow down and use extra caution to avoid
hydroplaning.
When it is safe to do so, please send your reports of hail of any
