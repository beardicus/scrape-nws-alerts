<description>...Warmest Temperatures of the season will lead to rising river
levels again late this weekend...
The warmest temperatures of the season are expected Friday and
Saturday, and will enhance snowmelt in the mountains producing
another increase of flows on area waterways this weekend. Isolated
to scattered showers and thunderstorms Saturday and Sunday may also
add additional water locally. Many waterways could reach close to
bankfull by Saturday afternoon or Sunday with minor flooding
possible. However, this is not expected to compare at all to the
recent serious flooding in the area earlier this week and should be
comparable to more typical run-off we see this time of year.
Smaller streams will see the greatest rises, and stream conditions
may see sudden changes which could present difficulties for those
recreating in the foothills. Unpaved roads may suddenly be covered
in water, becoming muddy and impassable.
The severity of the impacts will be very sensitive to just how warm
we get as well as how warm the overnight lows are. Currently, highs
in the 70s in the mountains are forecast with lows in the 40s.
Cooler temperatures are expected earlier next week which will help
slow the snowmelt.
All persons in the mountains and foothills this weekend should be
prepared for changing conditions and use extreme caution when near
waterways. Flows will be fast, and the water is cold.
Stay tuned to the forecast for the latest temperature and
precipitation trends, along with any warnings or advisories that may
be issued. Please report any flooding to local law enforcement and
have them relay the report to the National Weather Service.</description>
