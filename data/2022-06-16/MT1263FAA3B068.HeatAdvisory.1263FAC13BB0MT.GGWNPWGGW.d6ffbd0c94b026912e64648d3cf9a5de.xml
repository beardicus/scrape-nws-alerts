The National Weather Service in Glasgow has issued a Heat

* IMPACTS...The combination of early season hot temperatures and
high humidity will combine to create a situation in which heat

<instruction>A Heat Advisory means that a period of hot temperatures is
expected. Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned
room, stay out of the sun, and check up on relatives and
neighbors.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside.
When possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear light weight and loose fitting clothing when
