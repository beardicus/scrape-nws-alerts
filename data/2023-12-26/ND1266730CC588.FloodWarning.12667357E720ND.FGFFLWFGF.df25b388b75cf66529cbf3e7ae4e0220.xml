<description>...The National Weather Service in Grand Forks ND has issued a Flood
Warning for the following rivers in Minnesota...North Dakota...
Red River of the North at Wahpeton affecting Wilkin and Richland
Counties.
Red River of the North at Fargo affecting Clay and Cass Counties.

.Recent rainfall due to a large area of low pressure with
accompanying above normal seasonal temperatures resulted in up to
around 2 inches of liquid precipitation falling in the southern Red
River Basin. The rain fell on mostly frozen ground allowing the
water to run off into into the mainstem Red River. Addition flows
moving north on the Bois de Sioux near Lake Traverse are also
contributing to the river rises. Therefore, the forecast is for
Wahpeton, Fargo and Abercrombie to reach minor flood stage.

forecast.

flooding is forecast.
