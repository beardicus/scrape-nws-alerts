<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued December 26 at 3:01AM PST until December 30 at 3:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 AM PST THIS
MORNING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM THIS EVENING TO
3 AM PST THURSDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM THURSDAY TO 3 PM
PST SATURDAY...
...HIGH SURF WARNING NOW IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM THURSDAY TO 9 PM PST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, nuisance to minor
coastal flooding around 8:00 AM high tide. For the High Surf
Advisory, large breaking waves of 7 to 10 feet with dangerous
rip currents. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal
flooding expected around morning high tides. For the High Surf
Warning, dangerously large breaking waves of 10 to 15 feet with
local sets up to 18 feet and life- threatening rip currents.
* WHERE...Ventura County Beaches.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, until 11 AM PST this
morning. For the High Surf Advisory, from 9 PM this evening to
3 AM PST Thursday. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 3 AM
Thursday to 3 PM PST Saturday. For the High Surf Warning, from
3 AM Thursday to 9 PM PST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely, around the time of
high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as
parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to roads
or structures is NOT expected. Powerful waves and strong rip
currents will pose an exceptional risk of ocean drowning and
damage to coastal structures like piers and jetties. Large
breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and
rocks, and capsize small boats near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...During the High Surf Warning, highest waves
will likely be near Ventura Harbor, and for west facing beaches.
During the Coastal Flood Advisory, the very large surf combined
with relatively high tides of 6.0 to 6.7 feet (occuring between 9:00
AM and 10:30 AM, Thursday through Saturday) may result in more
significant coastal flooding and beach erosion.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other water side
infrastructure.</instruction>
