<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued December 26 at 12:16PM PST until December 29 at 3:00AM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM PST THIS
AFTERNOON...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM WEDNESDAY TO 3 AM
PST FRIDAY...
...HIGH SURF WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM THURSDAY TO 3 AM
PST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the first Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal
flooding expected in the Bay. For the second Coastal Flood
Advisory, minor coastal flooding expected on the coast. For the
High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking waves of 25 to 30
ft.
* WHERE...San Francisco County.
* WHEN...For the first Coastal Flood Advisory, until 1 PM PST
this afternoon. For the second Coastal Flood Advisory, from 9
AM Wednesday to 3 AM PST Friday. For the High Surf Warning,
from 3 AM Thursday to 3 AM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Breaking waves can sweep
people off jetties and docks, and into dangerous seas. Life-
threatening swimming conditions and significant beach erosion
can be expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Tidal levels are running around 1 foot
higher than tidal predictions. High tide will peak about 10:46
am PST Wednesday between 7.0 to 7.5 feet above MLLW, resulting
in minor coastal flooding for low-lying, flood-prone spots
adjacent to the San Francisco Bay. Strong southerly winds and
increasing surf will contribute to coastal flooding along the
Pacific Ocean beginning Wednesday.</description>
<instruction>During the coastal flood: If travel is required, allow extra time
as some roads may be closed. Do not drive around barricades or
through water of unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to
protect flood-prone property.
Remain out of the water during the High Surf to avoid hazardous
swimming conditions. Large breaking waves along the coast will
lead to increased run-up on beaches with waves topping and
washing over large rocks and jetties. These large waves can be
erratic and unpredictable. Use extra caution near the surf zone as
these large waves will be capable of sweeping people into the
water. Avoid rocks and jetties. Avoid steep beaches. Stay much
farther back from the water and never turn your back on the ocean.</instruction>
