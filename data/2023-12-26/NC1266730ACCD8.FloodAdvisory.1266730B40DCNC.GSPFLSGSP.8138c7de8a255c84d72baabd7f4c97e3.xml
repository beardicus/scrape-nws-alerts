<headline>Flood Advisory issued December 26 at 12:18AM EST until further notice by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON EST TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Transylvania County, North Carolina
* WHEN...Until noon EST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks,
greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and
parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.
A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1153 PM EST, Light to moderate rainfall has persisted
across Transylvania County since yesterday morning.  Doppler
radar and automated gauges indicate 2-5 inches of rain has
accumulated over the past 12 hours.  Isolated areas near Lake
Toxaway have received nearly 6 inches of rainfall.  Area
streams are gradually rising and some are approaching
bankfull or Action/Advisory Stage, including Little River
near Penrose and the Davidson River above Pisgah Forest.  At
these levels nuisance flooding of adjacent low-lying areas is
beginning, including near Cascade Lake Rd and Davidson River
Rd.  Additional streams are likely to exceed bankfull levels
into the morning hours as rainfall and runoff continues.
This includes the French Broad River and its headwaters from
above Rosman to Brevard to Blantyre.  Therefore, a Flood
Advisory has been issued and will remain in place into
Tuesday afternoon.
- The French Broad River near Rosman is at 5.56 feet and rising
slowly.  Action/Advisory Stage is 7.0 feet.  However,
moderate rain rates have moved off to the north and east of
Transylvania County so the French Broad River headwaters may
temporarily crest over the next few hours at or below Action
Stage if new areas of moderate rain do not develop.  Similar
conditions exist in the headwaters of the Little River near
Cedar Mountain.
Additional rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches is expected
through Tuesday afternoon, with isolated totals exceeding 4
inches possible.  This additional rainfall will likely cause
area streams to approach and exceed Minor Flood Stage,
resulting in more significant lowland flooding.  If these
conditions develop, a Flood Warning may be issued.  Steps to
protect vulnerable property adjacent to streams should be
taken before flood waters develop and rise.
Areas of heavier rainfall are also possible through Tuesday
afternoon.  Intense rainfall rates may result in an
acceleration of stream rises as upper soils are already
saturated from earlier rainfall.  This may cause flash
flooding to develop and a Flash Flood Warning may be
necessary.  If rapid stream rises are observed, avoid all
low-lying areas near streams and be prepared to seek higher
ground.
- Some locations that may experience nuisance flooding
include...
Brevard, Rosman, Gorges State Park, Lake Toxaway, Dupont
State Forest, Pisgah Forest, Connestee, Balsam Grove, Cedar
Mountain, and Penrose.

<instruction>Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
