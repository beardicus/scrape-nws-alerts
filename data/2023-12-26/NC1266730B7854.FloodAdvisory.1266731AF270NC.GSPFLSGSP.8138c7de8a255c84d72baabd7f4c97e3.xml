<headline>Flood Advisory issued December 26 at 4:57AM EST until December 27 at 6:00AM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON EST TODAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...A portion of western North Carolina, including the
following county, Transylvania.
* WHEN...Until noon EST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks,
greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and
parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.
A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 442 AM EST, Over the past few hours, showers have weakened
across Transylvania County, allowing runoff to subside and
smaller streams to crest, including the headwaters of the
French Broad River near and above Rosman, the Little River
near Cedar Mountain, and the Davidson River above Pisgah
Forest.  However, an axis of showers and thunderstorms is
entering the area from the south, capable of producing
periods of heavy rain.  This rainfall will occur on top of
2-5 inches of rain which accumulated since yesterday morning.
Heavy rainfall will exacerbate high flow conditions and
likely cause new rises on elevated streams.  As a result,
nuisance flooding conditions are expected to return or become
more widespread, with some Minor Flooding or more significant
flooding of flood-prone areas possible.  Therefore, the Flood
Advisory will continue as this heavy rain develops over the
area.
- The French Broad River near Rosman is at 4.7 feet and falling
slowly.  The river crested at 5.7 feet at midnight.
Action/Advisory Stage is 7.0 feet.  This heavy rain entering
the area is likely to cause new rises at Rosman, and it is
possible Rosman will exceed Action/Advisory Stage.  Similar
conditions exist in the headwaters of the Little River near
Cedar Mountain, where the river crested at Action/Advisory
Stage and is currently slowly falling below 5.9 feet.
Intense rainfall rates may result in an acceleration of
stream rises as upper soils are already saturated from
earlier rainfall.  This may cause flash flooding to develop
and a Flash Flood Warning may be necessary.  If rapid stream
rises are observed, avoid all low-lying areas near streams
and be prepared to seek higher ground.  Additional periods of
heavier rainfall are possible through Tuesday afternoon.
- Some locations that may experience nuisance flooding
include...
Brevard, Rosman, Gorges State Park, Lake Toxaway, Dupont
State Forest, Pisgah Forest, Connestee, Balsam Grove, Cedar
Mountain, and Penrose.</description>
<instruction>In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
