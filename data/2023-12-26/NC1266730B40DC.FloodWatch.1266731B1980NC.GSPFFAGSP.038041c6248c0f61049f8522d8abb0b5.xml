<headline>Flood Watch issued December 26 at 3:15AM EST until December 27 at 7:00AM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH WEDNESDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of western North Carolina, including the
following areas, Avery, Burke Mountains, Caldwell Mountains,
Eastern McDowell, Greater Burke, Greater Caldwell, McDowell
Mountains, Mitchell and Yancey.
* WHEN...Through Wednesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Deep moisture across the area and strong southeasterly low
level flow will lead to heavy rainfall tonight. Isolated to
scattered thunderstorms are also possible which could
increase rainfall rates where they develop. 2 to 4 inches of
rain has already fallen with additional amounts of 1 to 3
inches are expected through tonight. This could lead to
flooding, especially locations along and near the Blue Ridge
Escarpment where upslope flow could enhance rainfall rates.

rapid onset flooding based on current forecasts. Flash flooding is a

flood. Please monitor the latest forecasts and be prepared to take
action quickly should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.</instruction>
