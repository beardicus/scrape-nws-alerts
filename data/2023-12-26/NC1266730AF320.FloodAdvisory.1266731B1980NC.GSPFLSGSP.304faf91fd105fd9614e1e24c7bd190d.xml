<headline>Flood Advisory issued December 26 at 1:16AM EST until December 27 at 7:00AM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has issued
a Flood Advisory for the following rivers in North Carolina...
French Broad River At Blantyre affecting Transylvania and
Henderson Counties.
.Light to moderate rain has persisted across the upper French Broad
River Valley since Monday morning.  The watershed has gradually
received 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated areas along the
Tanasee and Pisgah Ridges approaching 5 inches.  This has saturated
upper soils and is causing excessive runoff into the headwaters of
the French Broad River, resulting in significant rises downstream
from Brevard to Blantyre to Etowah.  Based on rainfall already
received, the French Broad River is expected to approach and
possibly exceed bankfull, causing nuisance flooding of adjacent,
low-lying areas later this morning.  However, moderate to heavy
rainfall may develop later this morning, which would cause more
significant rises to occur.  This may result in deeper flooding of
low-lying areas and possible impacts to common flood-prone
roadways.  Monitor the latest river observations and forecasts for
updates.  A River Flood Warning may be required if the French Broad
River is expected to exceed 16.5-17.0 feet.
...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM THIS MORNING TO TOMORROW MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...French Broad River at Blantyre.
* WHEN...From this morning to tomorrow morning.
* IMPACTS...At 15.0 feet, Action Stage.  Most farm fields are
flooding between the French Broad River and Brevard Rd. and
between the French Broad River and Pleasant Grove Rd.
At 16.0 feet, Minor Flood Stage. Farmland flooding continues on
both sides of the French Broad River. Floodwaters begin to impact
boat access areas at Grove Bridge Rd and Crab Creek Rd.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 12:30 AM EST Tuesday the stage was 10.7 feet and rising
steadily.
- Forecast...The river is expected to approach the Minor Flood
Stage of 16.0 feet late this morning or during the afternoon.
Additional rounds of heavy rainfall may force the river to
exceed Minor Flood Stage and approach 17.0 feet this
afternoon or evening.  If this heavy rainfall/runoff occurs,
a River Flood Warning may be required.
- Action/Advisory Stage is 15.0 feet.
- Minor Flood Stage is 16.0 feet.
