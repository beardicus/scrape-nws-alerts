<description>THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE IS TRANSMITTED AT THE REQUEST OF THE Kit
Carson Emergency Management.
Road conditions are rapidly degrading due to continued blowing
snow. At this time, highways and county roads are currently closed
with the exception of Interstate 70 eastbound. Kit Carson county
highly encourages individuals to stay home and off the roads.
Disregard for barricades is highly discouraged as emergency
response services will be limited and will result in delayed
response times. Kit Carson county vehicle recovery services are
currently closed until further notice.</description>
