<senderName>NWS Eastern ND and Grand Forks (Northeastern North Dakota and Northwestern Minnesota)</senderName>
<headline>Flood Warning issued December 26 at 10:48PM CST until further notice by NWS Eastern ND and Grand Forks</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in
Minnesota...North Dakota...
Red River of the North at Wahpeton affecting Wilkin and Richland
Counties.
...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in
Minnesota...North Dakota...
Red River of the North at Fargo affecting Clay and Cass Counties.
Wild Rice River (ND) near Abercrombie affecting Richland County.
.Recent rainfall due to a large area of low pressure with
accompanying above normal seasonal temperatures resulted in up to
around 2 inches of liquid precipitation falling in the southern Red
River Basin. The rain fell on mostly frozen ground allowing the
water to run off into into the mainstem Red River. Addition flows
moving north on the Bois de Sioux near Lake Traverse are also
contributing to the river rises. Therefore, the forecast is for
Wahpeton, Fargo and Abercrombie to reach minor flood stage.
For the Red River...including Wahpeton, Fargo...Minor flooding is
forecast.
For the Wild Rice River (ND)...including Abercrombie...Minor
flooding is forecast.
