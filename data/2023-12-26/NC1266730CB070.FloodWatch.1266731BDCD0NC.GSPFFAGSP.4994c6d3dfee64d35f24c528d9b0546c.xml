<headline>Flood Watch issued December 26 at 12:56PM EST until December 27 at 12:00PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM EST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of western North Carolina, including the
following areas, Eastern Polk, Greater Rutherford, Henderson, Polk
Mountains, Rutherford Mountains and Transylvania and upstate South
Carolina, including the following areas, Central Greenville,
Greater Pickens, Greenville Mountains, Northern Spartanburg and
Pickens Mountains.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM EST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Deep moisture across the area and strong southeasterly low
level flow will lead to heavy rainfall tonight. Isolated to
scattered thunderstorms are also possible which could
increase rainfall rates where they develop. 2 to 4 inches of
rain has already fallen with additional amounts of 1 to 2
inches are expected through tonight. This could lead to
flooding, especially locations along and near the Blue Ridge
Escarpment where upslope flow could enhance rainfall rates.

<instruction>A Flood Watch means there is a potential for flooding based on
current forecasts. Please monitor the latest forecasts and be alert
for possible Flood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding
should be prepared to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
