<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued December 26 at 3:01AM PST until December 28 at 3:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH WEDNESDAY
AFTERNOON...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM TO 3 PM PST
THURSDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM THURSDAY TO 3 AM
PST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, nuisance to minor
coastal flooding during morning high tides. For the Coastal
Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding expected around morning
high tides. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of
7 to 12 feet with dangerous rip currents. Local sets of 15 to 20
feet will be likely near Point Conception.
* WHERE...Catalina and Santa Barbara Islands, Santa Barbara
County Southwestern Coast, Santa Barbara County Southeastern
Coast, Malibu Coast and Los Angeles County Beaches.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, through Wednesday
afternoon. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 3 AM to 3 PM
PST Thursday. For the High Surf Advisory, from 3 AM Thursday
to 3 AM PST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely, around the time of
high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as
parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to roads
or structures is NOT expected. There is an increased risk for
ocean drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers and surfers out
to sea. Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off
beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The highest surf will be across west facing
beaches. During the Coastal Flood Advisory, the high surf
combined with relatively high tides of 6.5 to 6.7 feet (occuring
around 9:00 AM Thursday) may result in more significant coastal
flooding and beach erosion.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
