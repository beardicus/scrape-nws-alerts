<headline>High Surf Warning issued December 26 at 3:01AM PST until December 30 at 9:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 AM PST THURSDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM THURSDAY TO 3 PM
PST SATURDAY...
...HIGH SURF WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM THURSDAY TO 9 PM
PST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 10 to
13 feet, with local sets to 15 feet tonight, and dangerous rip
currents. Also nuisance coastal flooding during the morning
high tides. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor to moderate
coastal flooding expected around morning high tides. For the
High Surf Warning, potentially damaging breaking waves of 17 to
22 feet with local sets to 25 feet are likely, and life-
threatening rip currents.
* WHERE...San Luis Obispo County Beaches and Santa Barbara
County Central Coast Beaches.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 3 AM PST Thursday.
For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 3 AM Thursday to 3 PM PST
Saturday. For the High Surf Warning, from 3 AM Thursday to 9
PM PST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely, around the time of
high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as
parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to
roads or structures is NOT expected. Powerful waves and strong
rip currents will pose an exceptional risk of ocean drowning
and damage to coastal structures like piers and jetties. Large
breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and
rocks, and capsize small boats near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The highest surf will be across west facing
beaches. During the Coastal Flood Advisory, the very large surf
combined with relatively high tides of 5.7 to 6.4 feet (occuring
between 9:30 AM and 11:00 AM, Thursday through Saturday) may
result in more significant coastal flooding and beach erosion.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other water side
infrastructure.</instruction>
