<headline>Flood Advisory issued December 26 at 11:55PM EST until December 27 at 8:00AM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 330 AM EST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by runoff from recent excessive rainfall
continues.
* WHERE...Cabarrus County in Piedmont North Carolina.
* WHEN...Until 330 AM EST.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1151 PM EST, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated continued light rain showers falling across
Cabarrus County. This rain is falling on areas with ongoing
minor flooding conditions along streams and creeks, and the
additional rainfall will slow any falling of the stream
levels through the early morning hours. Minor flooding is
thus expected to continue in the advisory area.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Kannapolis, Concord, Harrisburg, Enochville, Mt Pleasant,
Charlotte Motor Speedway, Coddle Creek Reservoir and Midland.
- Flooding is most likely along the Rocky River and Back Creek.
Additional flooding is likely along Clarke Creek near
Harrisburg.
