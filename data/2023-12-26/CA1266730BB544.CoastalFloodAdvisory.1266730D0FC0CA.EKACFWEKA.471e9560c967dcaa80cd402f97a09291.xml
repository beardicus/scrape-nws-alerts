<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued December 26 at 3:13AM PST until December 26 at 12:00PM PST by NWS Eureka</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM THIS
MORNING TO NOON PST TODAY...
...HIGH SURF WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM TO 3 PM PST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...High astronomical tides will cause minor flooding in low
lying areas along Humboldt Bay. Up to one quarter foot of
saltwater inundation above ground level is possible in low lying
areas near shorelines and tidal waterways (Between 8.7 and 9.0
feet MLLW at the North Spit tide gauge). For the High Surf
Warning, dangerously large breaking waves with surf runup of 28
to 32 feet.
* WHERE...Northern Humboldt Coast. For the flood advisory, just
around Humboldt Bay.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 9 AM this morning to
noon PST today. For the High Surf Warning, from 3 AM to 3 PM PST
Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Breaking waves can sweep
people off jetties and docks, and into dangerous seas. Life-
threatening surfing conditions and significant beach erosion
can be expected.</description>
<instruction>A Coastal Flood Advisory indicates that onshore winds and tides
will combine to generate flooding of low areas along the shore.
Feet Above Ground is locally defined as feet above the Highest
Astronomical Tide or HAT.
Large breaking waves along the coast will lead to increased wave
run-up on beaches with waves topping and washing over large rocks
and jetties. These large waves can be erratic and unpredictable.
Use extra caution near the surf zone as these large waves will be
capable of sweeping people into the frigid and turbulent ocean
water. Mariners traversing the bar are urged to exercise extreme
caution or stay in port until the threat subsides. Please contact
the U.S. Coast Guard for information regarding harbor and bar
closures.</instruction>
