...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in

.Recent rainfall due to a large area of low pressure with
accompanying above normal seasonal temperatures resulted in up to
around 2 inches of liquid precipitation falling in the southern Red

moving north on the Bois de Sioux near Lake Traverse are also
contributing to the river rises. Therefore, the forecast is for

forecast.
