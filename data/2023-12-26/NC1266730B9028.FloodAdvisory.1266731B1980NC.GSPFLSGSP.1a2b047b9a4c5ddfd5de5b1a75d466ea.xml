<headline>Flood Advisory issued December 26 at 5:18AM EST until December 27 at 7:00AM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM EST THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...Central and southern Henderson County and Polk County in
North Carolina
* WHEN...Until 100 PM EST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks, greenways,
boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and parking lots.
Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.  A few flood-
prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 505 AM EST, Over the past few hours, showers have weakened
across Henderson and Polk counties, allowing smaller streams
to crest, including Bat Fork Creek and the headwaters of Mud
Creek.  However, an axis of showers and thunderstorms is
approaching the area from the southwest, capable of producing
additional moderate to heavy rainfall.  This rainfall will
occur on top of 2-4 inches of rain which accumulated since
yesterday morning.  This rainfall will exacerbate high flow
conditions and likely cause new rises on elevated streams, or
cause rising streams to crest at higher levels.  As a result,
nuisance flood conditions are expected to return or become
more widespread, with some Minor Flooding or more significant
flooding of flood-prone areas possible.  Furthermore, it will
take some time for larger streams to crest even without
additional significant rainfall, including Mud Creek near
Hendersonville and the Green River in Polk County.
Therefore, the Flood Advisory will continue into the early
afternoon.
Mud Creek from Crail Farm Rd to Erkwood Dr to White St and S
Center Plaza to the Oklawaha Greenway continues to rise and
is exceeding its banks, flooding adjacent low-lying areas.
The following streamgauge is above Action/Advisory Stage,
resulting in nuisance flooding along Mud Creek...
ID: MNMN7
NAME: at N Main St, 1 N Hendersonville
CURRENT STAGE: 12.32 feet
ACTION/ADVISORY STAGE: 11.5
MINOR FLOOD STAGE: 14.0
TREND: Rising Slowly
FORECAST: Mud Creek is expected to continue to approach 13
feet over the next few hours and may exceed Minor Flood Stage
later Tuesday morning.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches is expected
through Tuesday afternoon, with isolated totals exceeding 3
inches possible.   Intense rainfall rates may result in an
acceleration of stream rises as upper soils are already
saturated from earlier rainfall.  This may cause flash
flooding to develop and a Flash Flood Warning may be
necessary.  If rapid stream rises are observed, avoid all
low-lying areas near streams and be prepared to seek higher
ground.
- Some locations that may experience nuisance flooding
include...
Hendersonville, Columbus, Flat Rock, Etowah, Mountain Home,
Laurel Park, Tryon, Saluda, Dupont State Forest, Valley Hill,
Dana, Lake Adger, East Flat Rock, Mill Spring, Tuxedo, Crab
Creek and Green Creek.</description>
<instruction>In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
