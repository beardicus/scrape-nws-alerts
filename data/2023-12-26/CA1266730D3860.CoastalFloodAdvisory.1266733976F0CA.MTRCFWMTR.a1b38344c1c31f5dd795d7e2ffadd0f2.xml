<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued December 26 at 1:04PM PST until December 29 at 3:00AM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM WEDNESDAY
TO 3 AM PST FRIDAY...
...HIGH SURF WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM THURSDAY TO 3 AM
PST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding
expected. For the High Surf Warning, dangerous large breaking
waves of 25 to 30 ft.
* WHERE...Coastal North Bay Including Point Reyes National
Seashore, San Francisco Peninsula Coast, Northern Monterey Bay
and Southern Monterey Bay and Big Sur Coast Counties. The
Breaking waves will be highest along W and NW facing beaches.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 9 AM Wednesday to
3 AM PST Friday. For the High Surf Warning, from 3 AM Thursday
to 3 AM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Breaking waves can sweep
people off jetties and docks, and into dangerous seas. Life-
threatening swimming conditions and significant beach erosion
can be expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Large west waves will arrive Thursday
morning and last into the late morning before slowly reducing
into late that night. Beaches are at risk for large turbulent
shore break and strong currents.</description>
<instruction>During the coastal flood: If travel is required, allow extra time
as some roads may be closed. Do not drive around barricades or
through water of unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to
protect flood-prone property.
Remain out of the water during the High Surf to avoid hazardous
swimming conditions. Large breaking waves along the coast will
lead to increased run-up on beaches with waves topping and
washing over large rocks and jetties. These large waves can be
erratic and unpredictable. Use extra caution near the surf zone
as these large waves will be capable of sweeping people into the
water. Avoid rocks and jetties. Avoid steep beaches. Stay much
farther back from the water and never turn your back on the
ocean.</instruction>
