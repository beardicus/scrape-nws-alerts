<description>...Very Hot Weekend Over The Eastern Interior...
...High Water On The Tanana River Into Next Week...
The Eastern Interior will become warmer and drier over the
weekend with isolated afternoon thunderstorms. Temperatures
will rise into the 80s over most of the Eastern Interior on
Saturday, and into the 80s and low 90s on Sunday and Monday.
Fairbanks is expected to reach 90 on Sunday and Monday. Similar
hot and dry conditions with isolated afternoon thunderstorms will
likely continue over the Eastern Interior into the middle of next
week. There will likely be a return of smoke from Canadian wild
fires over the Eastern Interior this weekend. People should take
precautions for heat this weekend.
The Tanana River is near bankfull, and will remain very high into
next week. This high water is due to rising freezing levels
adding high elevation snow and glacial melt this weekend into next
week. Other glacial rivers draining the Alaska Range such as the
Delta and Nenana Rivers will also remain very high into next
week. Most gravel bars on the Tanana River will be covered by
water, and some normally dry sloughs and other low lying areas
will fill with water. Low areas around boat launches could see
water in them. These glacial rivers will contain an increased
numbers of logs and trees floating down them through next week and
boaters should use caution.</description>
