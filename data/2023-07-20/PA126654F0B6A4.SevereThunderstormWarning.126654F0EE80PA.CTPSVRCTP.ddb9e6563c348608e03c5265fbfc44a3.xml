If boating or fishing on Raystown Lake, get away from the water and
move indoors or inside a vehicle. Remember, lightning can strike out
to 15 miles from the parent thunderstorm. If you can hear thunder,
you are close enough to be struck by lightning. Move to safe shelter
now! Do not be caught on the water in a thunderstorm.
Very heavy rainfall is occurring with these storms, and may lead to
flash flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flooded roadways.</instruction>
