<headline>Red Flag Warning issued March 30 at 3:03PM MDT until March 31 at 7:00PM MDT by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>...TWO CONSECUTIVE DAYS OF CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS...
.Strong southwest winds from Park County eastward across the
Palmer Divide area, most of Denver, and the adjacent plains will
gradually weaken this evening. Until then, the winds in
combination of drying fuels and very low humidity will create
critical fire weather conditions.
Another round of strong, gusty winds can be expected on Friday.
This time, those winds will be from the northwest ushering in
cooler temperatures. However, the airmass will remain quite dry
in the lower elevations so critical fire weather conditions can
again be expected in areas that haven`t seen appreciable snowfall
lately. This also includes South Park, which has been expanded
into the Red Flag Warning for Friday.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM MDT THIS EVENING
FOR WIND AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR SOUTH PARK...FIRE WEATHER
ZONE 214...
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM NOON TO 7 PM MDT FRIDAY FOR
