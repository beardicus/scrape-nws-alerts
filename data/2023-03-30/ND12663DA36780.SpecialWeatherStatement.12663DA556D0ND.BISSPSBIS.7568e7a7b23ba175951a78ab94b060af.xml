<description>...HAZARDOUS WINTER WEATHER POSSIBLE THIS EVENING THROUGH FRIDAY...
Multiple winter weather hazards could impact western and central
North Dakota this evening through Friday. A narrow band of snow is
likely to develop between the Highway 2 and Highway 200 corridors
this evening, ending early Friday morning. Widespread
accumulations around 1 to 3 inches are possible, but locally
higher amounts approaching 6 inches could occur. Freezing drizzle
is possible across south central and southeast North Dakota this
evening through tonight, which may cause a glaze of ice
accumulation. Snow will then become likely along and south of
Interstate 94 early Friday morning through Friday afternoon.
Strengthening winds could also create areas of blowing snow on
Friday, especially along and south of Interstate 94 between
Bismarck and Jamestown.
If you have travel plans today, be sure to check the latest
forecast and road conditions before you leave.</description>
