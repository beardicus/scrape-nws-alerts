<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued March 30 at 9:23PM CDT until March 31 at 1:00PM CDT by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...AREAS OF FREEZING RAIN TONIGHT WITH WIDESPREAD WINTRY
PRECIPITATION FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT WITH SNOW RATES OF 1 TO 2
INCHES PER HOUR POSSIBLE...
.A complex storm system developing over the Rockies will shift
east into the Central Plains tonight then gradually move into the
Great Lakes Friday night. Precipitation will continue developing
overnight as rain or freezing rain, depending on surface
temperatures. A light icing to a tenth of an inch of ice
accretion is likely mainly north of a line from Redwood Falls to
Buffalo MN to Rice Lake WI. The precipitation will then gradually
change over to snow Friday afternoon and evening, which could be
heavy at times. Snowfall amounts should range from 5 to 8 inches
across east central Minnesota and western Wisconsin, with locally
higher totals possible. 3 to 5 inches are expected across the rest
of central and western Minnesota. In addition, strong winds will
develop Friday afternoon which will persist through Friday night,
potentially producing blizzard conditions over much of western
Minnesota and possibly into parts of eastern Minnesota.
A Winter Weather Advisory is in place for much of western and
central Minnesota into northwest Wisconsin for freezing rain
tonight into early Friday. A Winter Storm Warning is now in effect
in areas north Interstate 90 for the combination of heavy snow
and blowing snow late Friday and Friday night. Blizzard conditions
remain possible and the Winter Storm Warning may be upgraded to a
Blizzard Warning in some areas when confidence continues to
increase with snow amounts.
