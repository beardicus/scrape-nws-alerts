<headline>Flood Advisory issued March 30 at 3:12AM PDT until further notice by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 415 AM PDT EARLY THIS
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...Much of Santa Barbara County.
* WHEN...Until 415 AM PDT.
* IMPACTS...Heavy rainfall could trigger shallow debris flows in and
near recent wildfire burn scars. Rises in small streams and
normally dry arroyos, as well as water over roadways will be
possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 308 AM PDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated heavy rain. Overflowing poor drainage areas will
cause minor flooding in the advisory area. Between 0.4 and 1
inch of rain has fallen.
- Additional rainfall amounts of up to 0.5 inches are expected
over the area. This additional rain will result in continued
minor flooding.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Santa Maria, Santa Barbara, Santa Ynez, Montecito,
Carpinteria, Solvang, Goleta and Buellton.
- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood</description>
<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas. The rain will likely trigger
shallow mud and debris flows, minor rock falls, and flooding capable
of localized damage, especially in steep terrain in and near burn
scars.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.</instruction>
