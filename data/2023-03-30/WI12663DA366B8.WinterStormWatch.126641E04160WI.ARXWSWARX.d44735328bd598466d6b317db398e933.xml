<description>...Potent Spring Storm to Bring Heavy Snow to the Region...
.A complex storm system will move into the region Thursday
through Saturday bringing a variety of weather with it including
heavy rain, severe storms, and heavy snow. A wintry mix with some
freezing rain and light snow could occur north of I94 tonight. The
main impactful snow is expected Friday night.
Rain changes to snow Friday night, with heavy, wet snow. At this
time, the heaviest snow is expected to fall north of I94 with
around 6 to 10 inches of accumulation. Farther south, amounts are
less confident due to potential differences in when the rain
switches over to snow and how far south the heavy snow will make
it. In addition northwest winds will increase on the backside of
the storm with gusts 35 to 45 mph with reduced visibilities and
some blowing and drifting of snow. The winds will remain elevated
Saturday morning.
...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY EVENING THROUGH
SATURDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 5 to 10
inches possible. Winds could gust as high as 45 mph. Blowing and
drifting of snow in open areas.
* WHERE...Taylor, Clark and Jackson Counties.
* WHEN...From Friday evening through Saturday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. Gusty winds could
bring down tree branches.</description>
