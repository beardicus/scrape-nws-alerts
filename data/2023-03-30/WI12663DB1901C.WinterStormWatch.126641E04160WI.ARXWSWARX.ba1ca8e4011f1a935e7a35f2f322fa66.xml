<description>...Strong Spring Storm to Bring Heavy Snow to the Region...
.A potent storm system brings a variety of impactful weather to
the region into Saturday morning. Tonight, a mix of snow and
freezing rain will fall across parts of north-central Wisconsin.
While totals will be relatively minor, travel impacts are
possible.
Come Friday night, wide spread rain transitions to snow. The snow
will be heavy at times, especially along and north of Interstate
94 where 1 to 2&quot; per hour rates are expected. Currently, the
higher amounts from 6 to 10 inches are favored north of Highway 10
in north-central Wisconsin. Moving south to Interstate 90, some
accumulations are expected, but the track of the storm and how
quickly rain transitions to just snow brings some uncertainty in
how much to expect.
In addition northwest winds will increase Friday night, gusting
from 35 to 45 mph. Visibilities will be further reduced in the
falling snow, with some drifting mostly in open areas.
