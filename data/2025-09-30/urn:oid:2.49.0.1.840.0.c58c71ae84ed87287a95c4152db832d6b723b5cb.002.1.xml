        <description>* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to one half foot of
inundation above ground level expected in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways.

* WHERE...Atlantic Coastal Cape May.

* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, until 7 PM EDT this
evening. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 2 PM to 8 PM EDT
Wednesday.

* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Rip currents can sweep even
the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.

continue through the remainder of the week. However, the surf
program ends on September 30. This will be the final day that
rip current statements will be issued.

        <instruction>A Coastal Flood Advisory means that minor tidal flooding is
expected. Minor tidal flooding often results in some road
closures. Usually, the most vulnerable roadways will flood.

Do not leave your vehicle at a location that is prone to tidal
flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flood waters. The
water may be deeper than you think it is. You will be putting
yourself in danger and your vehicle may be damaged, leading to
costly repairs.

Visit the National Water Prediction Service at
https://water.noaa.gov/wfo/phi for additional water level and
flood impact information for your local tide gauge.

Always obey posted Beach Flags. If you enter the surf zone,
always have a floatation device with you and swim near a
lifeguard if possible. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float and do not swim against the current. If able, swim parallel
to the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the shore and call or
wave for help.</instruction>
