<headline>High Wind Warning issued February 28 at 5:25AM AKST until March 02 at 6:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM WEDNESDAY TO 6 AM AKST
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...West winds 40 to 50 mph with gusts up to 80 mph
expected.
* WHERE...Kodiak Island.
* WHEN...From 6 AM Wednesday to 6 AM AKST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...High winds may move loose debris, damage property,
and cause power outages. Travel will be difficult, especially
for high profile vehicles.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Strong winds are expected to develop across
the entire island early Wednesday morning in the wake of a
deepening area of low pressure moving from near Kodiak City
northeast toward the Kenai Peninsula. Winds will then diminish
slightly by late Wednesday morning or early afternoon before
increasing again Wednesday evening. The combination of any
lingering snow showers or snow on the ground with the strong
winds may cause blowing and drifting snow. Visibility reductions
to one half mile are possible should this occur.</description>
<instruction>People are urged to secure loose objects that could be blown
around or damaged by the wind. Prepare for the possibility of
widespread power outages. Use caution if you must drive.</instruction>
