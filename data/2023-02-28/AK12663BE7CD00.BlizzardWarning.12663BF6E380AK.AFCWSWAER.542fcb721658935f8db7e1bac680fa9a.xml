<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 PM AKST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions. Additional snow accumulations of 3
to 6 inches from the Hope Cutoff to Seward and 6 to 12 inches
for Whittier, Portage, and Turnagain Pass. East winds gusting as
high as 45 mph through Portage Valley through early morning

Wednesday morning. Reduced visibility as low as one quarter
mile.
* WHERE...Portage Valley, eastern Turnagain Arm, and Seward.
* WHEN...Until 3 PM AKST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Winds will continue to increase through
Portage Valley and eastern Turnagain Arm, peaking tonight and
persisting into early Wednesday morning. As the area of low
pressure passes east of Seward early Wednesday morning,
northerly winds will quickly increase, peaking mid-morning
Wednesday before slowly diminishing late Wednesday afternoon.
Snow will likely be fluffy and windy conditions will
significantly reduce visibility and create snow drifts. Gusty
winds in Portage Valley and Whittier will shift to the west
Wednesday afternoon and persist through Thursday. Blowing snow
and reduced visibilities are likely to continue for these
locations through Thursday.</description>
<instruction>A Blizzard Warning means severe winter weather conditions are
expected or occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds
and poor visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout
conditions, making travel very hazardous. If you must travel,
have a winter survival kit with you.If you get stranded, stay
with your vehicle.
