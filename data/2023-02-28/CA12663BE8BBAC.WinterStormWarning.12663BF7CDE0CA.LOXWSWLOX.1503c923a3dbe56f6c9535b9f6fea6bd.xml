<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow. Heaviest tonight. Snow total of 10 to 20
inches with local amounts to 30 inches, highest in the eastern
San Gabriel mountains. Southwest to west winds 25 to 40 mph with
gusts between 50 mph and 60 mph through late tonight shifting to
the west to northwest 15 to 30 mph with gusts to 45 mph.
* WHERE...Ventura County Mountains, Los Angeles County Mountains
and Santa Barbara County Interior Mountains.
* WHEN...Until 10 PM PST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible due to
reduced visibility due to snow and blowing snow. Mountain roads,
including higher portions of Interstate 5 will likely be
impacted at times. Snow drifts, especially above 5000 feet, may
be another substantial travel hazard. The weight of recent snow
combined with strong winds may down trees and powerlines.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
The latest road conditions from CalTrans are available by calling
