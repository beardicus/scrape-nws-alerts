CDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...For the Excessive Heat Warning, dangerously hot
conditions with heat index values up to 105 expected. For the
Wind Advisory, southeast winds 25 to 30 mph with gusts up to 55
mph. Blowing dust may also reduce visibility to 1/2 mile at

* IMPACTS...Gusty winds could blow around unsecured objects. A few
power outages are possible. Extreme heat and humidity will
significantly increase the potential for heat related illnesses,
particularly for those working or participating in outdoor
activities. Blowing dust will make travel difficult at times,
particularly in rural areas.</description>
<instruction>Use extra caution when driving, especially if operating a high
profile vehicle. Secure outdoor objects.
Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
