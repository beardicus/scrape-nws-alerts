<description>...Heavy rain may increase river and stream flows Sunday into
Monday...
A weather system moving across the region is expected to bring
periods of showers and thunderstorms across the Beartooth Mountains
and foothills Sunday and Sunday evening. Some of the thunderstorms
could produce locally heavy rainfall. The best chance of heavy
rainfall from thunderstorms is around midday Sunday with another
round in the later afternoon and early evening.
With area waterways already running high with snowmelt, this
additional precipitation may push some rivers and streams close to
bankfull early this week. Please note, if any flooding occurs, it is
not expected to compare at all to the recent serious flooding in the
area last week.
Widespread heavy precipitation is not expected, so the location of
any local heavy rainfall that occurs Sunday will determine which
rivers and streams see notable rises. Smaller streams and creeks in
the foothills are the most susceptible to flooding during these
types of events in the snowmelt runoff season. That said, the Clarks
Fork of Yellowstone at Edgar and at Belfry may see levels approach
flood stage by Monday, with some minor flooding possible in adjacent
low lying areas. This is also true of the Stillwater River near
Absarokee.
Those with interests along area waterways should continue to monitor
water levels and use extra caution when near rivers and low lying
areas. Bank erosion will make shorelines unstable. Do not walk near
stream banks as the underlying soil may be eroded.
Stay tuned to the forecast for your area. Please report any flooding
to local law enforcement and have them relay the report to the
National Weather Service.</description>
