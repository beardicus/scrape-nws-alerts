<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued June 18 at 3:30PM MDT until June 18 at 6:30PM MDT by NWS El Paso</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in El Paso Tx/Santa Teresa has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
Northwestern Sierra County in south central New Mexico...
Northern Grant County in southwestern New Mexico...
* Until 630 PM MDT.
* At 330 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing
heavy rain across the warned area. Between 0.5 and 1 inch of rain
has fallen. Additional rainfall amounts up to 0.5 inches are
possible in the warned area. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected
to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through the Black Fire scar drainage. The debris flow can
consist of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
This warning replaces the two warnings currently out.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, roads, as
well as other poor drainage and low-lying areas.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Poverty Creek, Hermosa and Chloride.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>This is a life threatening situation. Heavy rainfall will cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks...streams...and
ditches in the Burn Scar. Severe debris flows can also be
anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may be washed away in
places. If you encounter flood waters...climb to safety.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rock slides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Remain alert for flooding even in locations not receiving rain.
Arroyos, streams, and rivers can become raging killer currents in a
matter of minutes, even from distant rainfall.</instruction>
