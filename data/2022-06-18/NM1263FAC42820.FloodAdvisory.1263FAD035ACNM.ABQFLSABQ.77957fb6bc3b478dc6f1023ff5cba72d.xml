<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
In hilly or mountainous terrain there are numerous of low water
crossings which are potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not
attempt to cross flooded roads. Find an alternate route.
Arroyos, streams, and normally dry rivers can become raging killer
currents in a matter of minutes. Water in arroyos can travel many
miles and take hours to reach your location from upstream rain areas.</instruction>
