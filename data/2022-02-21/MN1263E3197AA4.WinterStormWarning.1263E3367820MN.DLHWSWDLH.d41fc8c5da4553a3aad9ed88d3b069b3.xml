<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued February 21 at 10:01AM CST until February 23 at 12:00AM CST by NWS Duluth</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT CST
TUESDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Heavy snow. Snow accumulations of 10 to 16 inches, with
up to 19 inches along the South Shore of Lake Superior. Gusty
winds, especially around Lake Superior will cause blowing and
drifting. Near white-out conditions close to Lake Superior at
times.
* WHERE...Portions of northwest Wisconsin and east central and
northeast Minnesota.
* WHEN...Until midnight CST Tuesday night.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Patchy
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. Areas
closest to Lake Superior are at higher risk for near white out
conditions at times due to lake enhanced banded snow. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute. Wind chills as low as 25 below zero could cause
frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes tonight
into Tuesday morning.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...This will be a prolonged period of snow
with two main waves. The first will occur this morning into
this evening with a break in snow intensity tonight. The
second will occur on Tuesday with the snow diminishing in
intensity Tuesday night. The snow should be dry and fluffy.</description>

your vehicle in case of an emergency.
