<headline>Flood Watch issued February 21 at 9:42PM CST until February 22 at 6:00PM CST by NWS Chicago</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING...
The Flood Watch continues for
* Portions of Illinois and northwest Indiana, including the
following areas, in Illinois, Boone, Central Cook, De Kalb,
DuPage, Eastern Will, Grundy, Kane, Kendall, La Salle, Lake
IL, Lee, McHenry, Northern Cook, Northern Will, Ogle, Southern
Cook, Southern Will, and Winnebago. In northwest Indiana, Lake
IN and Porter.
* Through Tuesday morning
* WHEN...From Midnight CST tonight through Tuesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone
locations. Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban
areas. Underpasses may be flooded. Heavy river ice cover may
break up and lead to localized ice jams.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Showers and thunderstorms are expected to develop across
northern Illinois and northwest Indiana after midnight
tonight. Rain rates up half inch per hour are possible, with
isolated thunderstorms producing rain rates up to one inch
per hour. Soil frost depths of 8 to near 20 inches, with the
deepest frozen soils near the Wisconsin state line. Frozen
soil may limit infiltration and increase how much rainfall
becomes runoff headed toward streams and rivers. Heavy river
ice cover also remains in place along stretches of the Rock
River, Fox River, and their tributaries. River rises may
break up ice cover and cause localized ice jams.

<instruction>A Flood Watch means flooding is possible, but not yet certain,
based upon the latest forecasts. Persons with interests along
area rivers, creeks, and other waterways should monitor the
latest forecasts and be prepared to take action should flooding
develop.</instruction>
