<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued February 21 at 7:25PM PST until February 23 at 12:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM TUESDAY TO NOON
PST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Snow and icy road conditions expected. Total snow
accumulations of a dusting to one inch on the valley floor and 1
to 2 inches in the foothills. Snow levels will start around 2500
feet Tuesday afternoon, then lower to around 1500 feet Tuesday
night. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph will also cause dangerous
wind chill readings and locally reduced visibilities in blowing
snow.
* WHERE...San Luis Obispo County Interior Valleys.
* WHEN...From 1 PM Tuesday to noon PST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...This will be the coldest storm that we have seen so
far this winter season, with the potential for widespread
snow/ice impacts across many of our lower elevation passes which
could make for difficult travel with potential delays or road
closures. Major roadways that will likely have snow/ice impacts
include Highways 41, 46, and 58. Interior portions of Highway
101 may also experience a dusting of snow on Tuesday night.</description>
