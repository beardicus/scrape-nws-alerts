<description>...HEAVY SNOW TODAY ACROSS CENTRAL MINNESOTA INTO NORTHERN
WISCONSIN FOLLOWED BY WIDESPREAD SNOW THROUGH TUESDAY ACROSS THE
REGION...
.A long duration snowfall event will cause travel impacts across
the region beginning today and lasting through Tuesday. The
heaviest snow will fall along an east to west line across central
into northern Minnesota, namely along and north of a line from
Madison to Saint Cloud to Hayward. Snowfall amounts in this
region are likely to be in the 10 to 14 inch range, with locally
higher amounts possible. Most of this snow will fall today.
Winter Storm Warnings are in effect for this area.
The band of snow will gradually weaken and spread across the rest
of the region this afternoon through tonight, before exiting the
area Tuesday evening. It is in this timeframe when central to
southern Minnesota and western Wisconsin will see snow. Most
locations will see 3 to 6 inches of snow tonight through Tuesday.
There is a chance for an icy mix to develop across southern
Minnesota this afternoon and evening. Winter Weather Advisories
are in effect for the remaining counties beginning today and
lasting through Tuesday.
As mentioned earlier, travel impacts are expected through
Tuesday as the snow begins in your location. This will be a
lighter and more fluffy snow. Northeast winds of 20 to 25 mph will
lead to areas of blowing and drifting snow. Please plan on extra
travel time to reach your destination. The latest road conditions
for the state you are calling from can be obtained by calling 5 1
1. Road conditions can also be found at 511mn.org for Minnesota or
511wi.gov for Wisconsin.
