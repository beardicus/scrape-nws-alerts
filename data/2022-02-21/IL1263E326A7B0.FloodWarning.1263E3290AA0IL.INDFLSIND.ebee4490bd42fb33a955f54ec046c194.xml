<headline>Flood Warning issued February 21 at 8:36PM CST until further notice by NWS Indianapolis</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in
Indiana...
East Fork White River, White River.
...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in Indiana...
Illinois...
Wabash River, White River.
.A combination of snow melt, plentiful rainfall, and partially
frozen ground has led to flooding along much of the Wabash River,
White River south of Centerton, and portions of the East Fork White
River in western, central, and southern Indiana.  Rainfall from this
past Wednesday night through Thursday amounted to 1.5 to 2.5 inches.
Expected moderate to heavy rainfall tonight and Tuesday, possibly
totaling up to 2.10 inches, plus a mixed precipitation system coming
Wednesday night through Thursday night will likely prolong flooding,
and possibly recurrence of flooding on smaller waterways.
Flooding along the main stem rivers is expected to continue into at
least the first week of March.
...FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Wabash River at Hutsonville Legacy Power Plant Site.
* WHEN...Until further notice.
* IMPACTS...At 22.8 feet, Flooding extends to what is locally called
River Road in several areas. River Road is the rural way south
from Hutsonville to Palestine.  Flooding in this area affects
large expanses of agricultural land, river cabins and hunting
areas on both sides of the river.  Most local, unimproved roads
leading towards the river are flooded.  These roads led to farms,
river cabins, private residences, levees and a few oil wells.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- There is no current observed data.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise to a crest of 22.7
feet Saturday morning.
