<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued February 21 at 4:11AM AKST until February 22 at 1:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM THIS MORNING TO
1 AM AKST TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow accumulations of
1 to 11 inches and ice accumulations of a light glaze.
* WHERE...Lower Kuskokwim Valley.
* WHEN...From 11 AM this morning to 1 AM AKST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel may be difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A wet and moderately warm winter storm will
move over the Lower Kuskokwim Valley today. Southerly winds are
expected to develop throughout the day, which should raise the
temperatures to around freezing for the valley locations. There
is some uncertainty in temperatures at the surface and aloft,
which may cause a wide variation in precipitation type across
the region. Crooked Creek, Red Devil and Sleetmute are expected
to receive the most snow, with totals between 6 and 11 inches
possible. Warmer air aloft will favor the possibility of
freezing rain from Stony River east; however these areas may
remain cold enough for all snow, resulting in higher
accumulations as well. Aniak and Chuathbaluk are more likely to
receive a rain/snow mix for most of the event, but will likely
receive a few inches of accumulating snow as cold air returns later
tonight.</description>
