<headline>Flood Watch issued February 21 at 3:38AM EST until February 22 at 11:30AM EST by NWS Burlington</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY EVENING THROUGH LATE WEDNESDAY
NIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and/or snowmelt and/or ice jam is
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of northern New York and Vermont, including the
following counties, in northern New York, Eastern Essex,
Southeastern St. Lawrence, Southern Franklin and Western Essex. In
Vermont, Eastern Addison, Eastern Rutland, Washington, Western
Addison, Western Rutland and Windsor.
* WHEN...From Tuesday evening through late Wednesday night.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The combination of snow melt and 0.25 to 0.75 inches of
rainfall will cause sharp rises on streams and rivers.  A few
river gages may approach minor flood stage by Wednesday
morning. In addition, these expected rises will produce some
ice break up, increasing the risk of localized ice jam
related flooding on Tuesday night into Wednesday.  Areas that
currently have ice jams in place will be especially
susceptible to localized flooding.  Some rivers we are
watching closely include the Ausable River, Mad River, and
Otter Creek.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
