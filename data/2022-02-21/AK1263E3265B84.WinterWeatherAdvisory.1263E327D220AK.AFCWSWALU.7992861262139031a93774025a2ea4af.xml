<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued February 21 at 3:41PM AKST until February 22 at 1:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM AKST
TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow accumulations
of 2 to 10 inches and ice accumulations of a light glaze.
* WHERE...Lower Kuskokwim Valley.
* WHEN...From 11 AM this morning to 1 AM AKST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel may be difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A wet and moderately warm winter storm
continues to move through the Lower Kuskokwim Valley this
afternoon. Southerly winds will persist causing rising
temperatures to around freezing for the valley locations. There
is some uncertainty in temperatures at the surface and aloft,
which may cause a wide variation in precipitation type across
the region. Red Devil, Sleetmute and Stony River are expected to
receive the most snow, with totals between 6 and 9 inches
possible. Warmer air aloft will favor the possibility of
freezing rain from Stony River east; however these areas may
remain cold enough for all snow, resulting in higher
accumulations as well. Aniak and Chuathbaluk will continue to
receive rain into this evening and potentially rain/snow mix
into late tonight, but will likely receive a few inches of
accumulating snow as cold air returns later tonight.</description>
