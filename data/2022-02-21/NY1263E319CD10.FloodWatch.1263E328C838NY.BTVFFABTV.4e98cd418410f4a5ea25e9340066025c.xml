<headline>Flood Watch issued February 21 at 1:12PM EST until February 22 at 11:30AM EST by NWS Burlington</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY EVENING THROUGH LATE WEDNESDAY
NIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and/or snowmelt and/or ice jam is
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of northern New York and Vermont, including the
following county, in northern New York, Clinton. In Vermont,
Caledonia,  Chittenden, Franklin, Essex, Grand Isle, Lamoille,
Orange, and Orleans.
* WHEN...From Tuesday evening through late Wednesday night.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The combination of snow melt and rainfall of 0.25 to 0.75
inches will cause sharp rises on streams and rivers. A few
river gages may approach minor flood stage by Wednesday. In
addition, these rises are expected to produce ice breakups,
increasing the risk of localized ice jam related flooding.
Some rivers we are watching closely with ice jams already in
place include Chazy, Lamoille, and Missisquoi.
