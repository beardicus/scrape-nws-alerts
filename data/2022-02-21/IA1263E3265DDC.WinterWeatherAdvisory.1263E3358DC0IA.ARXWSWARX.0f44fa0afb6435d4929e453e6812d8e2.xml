<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued February 21 at 6:47PM CST until February 22 at 6:00PM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Wintry mix tonight eventually changes over to predominantly
snow tomorrow...
.The light and patchy wintry mix is expected to continue
expanding across the region throughout tonight. Snow chances will
become increasingly likely throughout the day spreading into the
area from the northwest to the southeast. The far southern
portions of the area should expect the least amount of snow near a
trace, but possible ice accumulations over 1 tenth of an inch.
Along and south of I-90, snow amounts from a few tenths up to 2
inches is possible with a light glaze to a tenth of an inch of
ice. North of I-90 will get the higher snowfall amounts from 3 to
6 inches with the higher amounts expected across the northern
portions of the area.
Travel will be impacted as untreated roads and other frozen
surfaces become slick due to the freezing drizzle and wintry mix.
Exercise caution, take it slow, and adjust travel plans
accordingly.
