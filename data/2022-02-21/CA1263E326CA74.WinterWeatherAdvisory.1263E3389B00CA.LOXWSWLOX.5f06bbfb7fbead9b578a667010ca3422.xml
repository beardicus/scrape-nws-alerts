<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued February 21 at 7:25PM PST until February 23 at 12:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM TUESDAY TO
NOON PST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Snow and icy road conditions expected. Total snow
accumulations of a dusting to one inch on the valley floor and 1
to 2 inches in the foothills. Winds gusting as high as 50 mph in
the Antelope Valley will also cause dangerous wind chill
readings and locally reduced visibilities in blowing
snow.
* WHERE...Cuyama Valley and Antelope Valley.
* WHEN...From 4 PM Tuesday to noon PST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...This will be the coldest storm that we have seen so
far this winter season, with the potential for widespread
snow/ice impacts across many of our lower elevation passes which
could make for difficult travel with potential delays or road
closures. Major roadways that will likely have snow/ice impacts
include Highways 14, 138, and 166.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
The latest road conditions from CalTrans are available by calling
