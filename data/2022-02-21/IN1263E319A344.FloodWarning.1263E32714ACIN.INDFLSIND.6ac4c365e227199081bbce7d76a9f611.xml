from Hutsonville to Palestine.  Flooding in this area affects
large expanses of agricultural land, river cabins and hunting
areas on both sides of the river.  Most local, unimproved roads
leading towards the river are flooded.  These roads led to farms,
river cabins, private residences, levees and a few oil wells.
