<description>...Potent Late Season Winter Storm with High Winds and Sierra
Snowfall Monday Followed by Sub-Freezing Temperatures...
* An incoming Pacific storm is still expected to move into the
area tomorrow. High winds, localized fire weather concerns,
areas of blowing dust, snow for the Sierra and western Nevada
foothills, and much cooler conditions are all on tap with this
storm.
* Winds: High winds with potentially damaging gusts of 60 mph or
more will materialize by Monday morning with the strongest winds
targeting wind prone sections of the Highway 395 and Interstate
580 corridor across western Nevada and Mono County. Sierra ridge
wind gusts are forecast to be near and above 100 mph. Blowing
dust may reduce visibility at times across Pershing, Churchill,
and Mineral counties. Conditions on area lakes will be hazardous
to small vessels.
* Snow: Snow will impact travel in the Sierra and northeast
California by early tomorrow morning, with rain and snow
spreading into western Nevada lower elevations late tomorrow
afternoon through the evening hours. Snowfall amounts of 8 to 14
inches are forecast near the Sierra crest, with up to 8 inches
down to the Tahoe basin and southward into western Mono County.
Across the remainder of western Nevada, snowfall will generally
be an inch or less.
* Temperatures: High temperatures early this week will be more
than 30 degrees colder compared to last week`s warm spell, with
widespread hard freezes likely both Monday and Tuesday nights.
Now is the time to prepare for this significant change back to
winter weather. Secure loose outdoor items before the winds
increase tomorrow, and have sufficient food, water, warm clothing
and emergency supplies handy in case of power outages. Anyone
planning travel in the Sierra Monday through early Tuesday can
expect slick travel conditions and delays with chain controls.
Bring inside or cover any cold sensitive plants.</description>
