<description>...AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS LASTING
THROUGH TUESDAY DUE TO STRONG WINDS, VERY LOW HUMIDITY, WARMER
THAN NORMAL TEMPERATURES, AND DEEP INSTABILITY...
For today we will see wide-spread windy conditions with very low
min RH`s, and therefore a Red Flag Warning is in effect for both
the mountains and the lowlands on this afternoon. Our winds and
dry conditions will continue on Monday so a Red Flag Warning has
been issued for Monday. An approaching upper level storm system
will give us even stronger winds on Tuesday, though a slight
uptick in moisture may keep western areas out of Red Flag
conditions. Areas to the east will likely reach Red Flag criteria.
As of now, a Fire Weather Watch has been issued for Tuesday for
mostly the lowland areas.
