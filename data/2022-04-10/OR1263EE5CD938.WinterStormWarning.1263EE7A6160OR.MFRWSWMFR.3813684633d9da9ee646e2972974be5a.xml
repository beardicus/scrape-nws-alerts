<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued April 10 at 5:46AM PDT until April 11 at 11:00PM PDT by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 5 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO
11 PM PDT MONDAY ABOVE 2500 FEET...
* WHAT...Accumulating wet snow above 2500 feet with total snow
accumulations of 5 to 10 inches. Higher elevations in the
backcountry could see upwards of 18 inches. Winds gusting as
high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of the Coast Range, Kalmiopsis in Josephine
County and, the Cascade Foothills and the Ashland Watershed in
Jackson County.
* WHEN...From 5 PM this afternoon to 11 PM PDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At Hayes Hill, Jacksonville Hill, and Sexton Summit around 10 AM
PDT, peak snowfall and gusty winds could create a short
timeframe for visibility reducing conditions from blowing snow.
More so at Sexton Summit, these conditions could begin a few
hours earlier and last a few hours longer into the afternoon.
- Strong winds combined with heavy snow could cause tree damage,
especially in the coast range where snow accumulations are
expected to be greater.
- For anyone heading south on I-5: approximately during the 5 AM
PDT to 9 AM PDT time frame, when winds are from the southwest,
Siskiyou Summit will be favored for a brief period of
orographically enhanced snowfall. The main impact from this is
expected to be from reduced visibility in blowing snow and
slippery roads as the snow melts on what are reported to be
relatively warm roadways.

* If you must travel, keep tire chains, a flashlight, blankets,
food, water, medications, and a fully charged phone with you.

* A Winter Storm Warning means that severe winter weather is
imminent, or likely and poses a threat to life and property.
Take protective action now.</instruction>
