<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued April 10 at 5:46AM PDT until April 11 at 11:00PM PDT by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 5 PM THIS
AFTERNOON TO 11 PM PDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy, wet snow accumulations of 8 to 15 inches with
higher elevations seeing up to 18 inches. Winds gusting as high
as 60 mph.
* WHERE...Southern Oregon Cascades from Highway 62 south to
Howard Prairie, including Highway 140.
* WHEN...From 5 PM this afternoon to 11 PM PDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...
- Travel could be very difficult. Blowing snow could
significantly reduce visibility.
- Strong winds combined with heavy snow could cause tree damage.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Although not included in the advisory-
approximately during the 5 AM PDT to 9 AM PDT Monday time
frame, when winds are from the southwest, Siskiyou Summit will
be favored for a brief period of orographically enhanced
snowfall. The main impact from this is expected to be from
reduced visibility in blowing snow and slippery roads as the
snow melts on what are reported to be relatively warm roadways.
