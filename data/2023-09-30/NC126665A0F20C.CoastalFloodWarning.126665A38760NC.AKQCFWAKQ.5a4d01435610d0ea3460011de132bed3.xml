<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM EDT SUNDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM TO 2 PM EDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, a high rip current risk.
For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to one foot of inundation
above ground level expected in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways. For the Coastal Flood Warning, one to two
feet of inundation above ground level expected in low-lying
areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...Eastern Currituck County.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, through Sunday
evening. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 6 AM EDT
Sunday. For the Coastal Flood Warning, from 6 AM to 2 PM EDT
Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Widespread flooding of vulnerable areas will result in
an elevated threat of property damage to homes and businesses
near the waterfront and shoreline. Water will be 1 to 2 feet
above ground level in some areas resulting in a sufficient depth
to close numerous roads and threaten homes and businesses.
Flooding will extend inland from the waterfront along tidal
rivers and bays resulting in some road closures and flooding of
vehicles. Breaking waves will result in rough surf conditions
and a high risk of rip currents.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
