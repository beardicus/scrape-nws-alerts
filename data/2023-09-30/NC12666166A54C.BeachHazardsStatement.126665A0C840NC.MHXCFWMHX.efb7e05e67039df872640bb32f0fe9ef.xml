<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY MORNING
THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip
currents, large breaking waves expected, and strong longshore
currents in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Watch, 2 to 4
feet of inundation above ground level possible in low-
lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...Northern Outer Banks.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, through this evening.
For the Coastal Flood Watch, from Sunday morning through
Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Up to 2 to 4 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible for some oceanfront properties and roadways resulting
in a significant threat to life and property. In some areas,
battering waves will cause additional damage to property. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw a swimmer or
surfer head first into the bottom causing neck and back
injuries. Strong longshore currents will create dangerous
swimming conditions.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
