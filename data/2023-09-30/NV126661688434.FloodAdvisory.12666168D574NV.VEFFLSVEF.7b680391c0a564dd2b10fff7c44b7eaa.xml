<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 345 PM PDT THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...A portion of south central Nevada, including the following
counties, Esmeralda and Nye.
* WHEN...Until 345 PM PDT.
* IMPACTS....UPDATE...Overall, the inherited short term forecast is
in good shape. Morning VWP from
dicates that 700mb flow was already starting to increase into the 30-
While high clouds are starting to invade from the west, sufficient
daytime heating should
promote a temperature lapse rate favorable for momentum transfer
down to the surface. As
such, the Wind Advisory (largely for gusts in excess of 40 mph)
appears to be in fine shape for most of the AZ High Country today.
Outside of loose outdoor articles being blown about (be sure to
secure them), pockets of blowing dust will be on the table,
particularly across the LCR, Navajo Nation and Hopi tribal areas.
Confidence is medium to high that blowing dust will reduce
visibility down to 4-5 miles.
Large scale ascent continues to increase and this should yield
increasing chances for largely high based convection---particularly
across the Hualapai and Havasupai tribal areas and western parts of
Grand Canyon Country. It`s here that the initial coverage of showers
and a storm or two will range between 20-30% by 5pm MST. The
coverage of precip will expand as we venture into the early evening
hours, especially for areas near and west of a Page to Prescott
line. Some of the higher elevations (above 8,000 feet) will have the
opportunity to see
a few snowflakes flying as cooler air aloft filters in. Significant
accumulations of snow (&gt; 2&quot;) are not anticipated at this time,
however, Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas. Areas
of moderate to heavy rainfall have been occurring
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 137 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms. NWS employee reports that areas of moderate to
heavy rainfall has been occurring along Highway 95. Minor
flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly in the
advisory area.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 0.25 to 0.50 inches are
expected over the area. This additional rain will result in
minor flooding.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Lida, Lida Junction, Scottys Junction, Gold Point and
Goldfield.
- Highway 95, State Route 266 and Scottys Castle Road.
