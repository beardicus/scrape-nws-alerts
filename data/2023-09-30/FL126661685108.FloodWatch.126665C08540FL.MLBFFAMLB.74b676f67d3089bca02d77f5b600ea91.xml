<headline>Flood Watch issued September 30 at 3:06PM EDT until October 03 at 4:00AM EDT by NWS Melbourne</headline>
<description>.Heavy rainfall over the past few days has already led to some
localized flooding and saturated ground conditions, especially along
the east central Florida coast. A lingering stalled front across the
region may produce persistent heavy rain bands and storms tonight
through Sunday, continuing the potential for locally heavy to
excessive rainfall across the coastal counties of east central
Florida.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of east central Florida, including the following
areas, Coastal Indian River, Coastal Martin, Coastal Saint Lucie,
Coastal Volusia, Inland Indian River, Inland Martin, Inland
Northern Brevard, Inland Saint Lucie, Inland Southern Brevard,
Inland Volusia, Mainland Northern Brevard, Mainland Southern
Brevard, Northern Brevard Barrier Islands and Southern Brevard
Barrier Islands.
* WHEN...Through Sunday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Heavy rainfall over the past several days has led to
saturated ground conditions, especially along the coast.
Additional localized heavy to excessive rainfall will be
possible across the east central Florida coastal counties
tonight through Sunday. Should any persistent bands of
stronger showers or storms develop, this will lead to
additional flooding, especially for any areas that have
already experienced flooding issues the past couple days and
in poor drainage and low lying areas.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
