...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY MORNING
THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, 1 to 2 feet of inundation
above ground level expected in low- lying areas around Hatteras
Village this morning. For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous
rip currents, large breaking waves expected, and strong
longshore currents in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood
Watch, significant ocean overwash with up to 2 to 4 of
inundation above ground level possible in low- lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...Hatteras Island.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 11 AM EDT this
morning. For the Beach Hazards Statement, through this
evening. For the Coastal Flood Watch, from Sunday morning
through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Up to 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in low-lying areas around Hatteras Village this
morning. Some roads and low lying property including parking
lots, parks, lawns, and homes adjacent to the waterfront will
experience shallow flooding. Rip currents can sweep even the
best swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore
break can throw a swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom
causing neck and back injuries. Strong longshore currents will
create dangerous swimming conditions. Up to 2 to 4 feet of
inundation above ground level is possible for some oceanfront
properties and roadways resulting in a significant threat to
life and property. In some areas, battering waves will cause
additional damage to property.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
