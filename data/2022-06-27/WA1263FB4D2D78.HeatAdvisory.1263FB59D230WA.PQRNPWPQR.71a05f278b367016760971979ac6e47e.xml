<headline>Heat Advisory issued June 27 at 1:14PM PDT until June 27 at 8:00PM PDT by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...HEAT ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM PDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Temperatures 90 to 95.
* WHERE...In Oregon, Greater Portland Metro Area, Upper Hood
River Valley, Western Columbia River Gorge and Central
Columbia River Gorge. In Washington, Greater Vancouver Area,
Western Columbia River Gorge and Central Columbia River Gorge.
* WHEN...Until 8 PM PDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Hot temperatures may cause heat illnesses. Remember,
rivers are still rather cool for late June. Nearly every year,
people die in rivers in southwest Washington and northwest
Oregon due to cold water shock during the season`s first heat
wave. Hot temperatures can make the cool water seem tempting,
but river temperatures in the 50s can easily result in cold
water shock that can kill in minutes.</description>
<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
