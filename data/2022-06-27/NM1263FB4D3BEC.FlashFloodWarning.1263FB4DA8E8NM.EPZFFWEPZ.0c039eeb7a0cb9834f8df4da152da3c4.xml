<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued June 27 at 2:51PM MDT until June 27 at 5:30PM MDT by NWS El Paso</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in El Paso Tx/Santa Teresa has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
The Black Fire burn scar in...
Western Sierra County in south central New Mexico...
* Until 530 PM MDT.
* At 251 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing
heavy rain over the Black Fire Burn Scar. Between 0.5 and 1 inch
of rain has fallen. Additional rainfall amounts of 0.5 to 1 inch
are possible in the warned area. Flash flooding is ongoing or
expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through the Black Fire Burn perimeter. The debris flow can
consist of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms in and around
the Black Fire Burn Scar.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flooding of areas in and around the Black Fire Burn
Scar.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
mainly rural areas of Western Sierra County
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Heavy rainfall will cause extensive flash flooding of creeks...
streams...and ditches in the Black Fire Burn Scar. Severe debris
flows can also be anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may
be washed away in places. If you encounter flood waters...climb to
safety.
Move away from recently burned areas. Extensive flooding of creeks,
roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains will
likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.</instruction>
