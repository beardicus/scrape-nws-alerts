<headline>Flood Watch issued August 18 at 1:42PM PDT until August 18 at 10:45PM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>.Hurricane Hilary will bring widespread impacts to much of the
Southwest through early next week. The biggest threat remains
flooding from excessive rainfall. While periods of rainfall are
possible at anytime over the next 5 days, Sunday night through
Monday will be the window where we will have the greatest flooding
threat.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH LATE
MONDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of east central California, including the
following area, Mono County. Portions of western Nevada, including
the following area, Mineral and Southern Lyon Counties.
* WHEN...From Sunday afternoon through late Monday night.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of small creaks,
streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations. Flooding
may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Hurricane Hilary is still expected to make landfall in the
northern part of the Baja of California or extreme southern
portion of coastal California late Sunday. While the system
will rapidly weaken, deep moisture will stream into the
Desert Southwest. Prolong periods of moderate to locally
heavy rainfall will impact much of the area, especially the
eastern Sierra and western Nevada.
