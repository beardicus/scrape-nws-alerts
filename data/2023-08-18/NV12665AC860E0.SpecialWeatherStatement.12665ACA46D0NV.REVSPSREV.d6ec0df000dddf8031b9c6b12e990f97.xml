<description>...Heavy rain with isolated flood potential Sunday-Monday...
* Showers and thunderstorms will continue to develop and push
northward this evening and tomorrow morning. These storms will
be capable of gusts in excess of 45 mph, which could kick up
dust from desert sinks and playas, in addition to localized
heavy rainfall and small hail. Another round of scattered to
widespread showers and thunderstorms will occur once again
Saturday afternoon and evening.
* Major Hurricane Hilary in the eastern Pacific is expected to
make landfall Sunday PM or early Monday AM along northern Baja
of California or extreme southern coastal California. While this
system will rapidly weaken into a remnant low by the time it
reaches Nevada, significant amounts of moisture will bring
periods of heavy rainfall to the region Sunday afternoon through
Monday. The greatest threat for flooding is across the Basin &amp;
Range and the eastern Sierra. However, isolated flooding cannot
be ruled out elsewhere across western Nevada and northeast
California. Have multiple ways to receive alerts in case flood
warnings are issued, and never drive through flooded roadways.
* Abundant cloud cover and rainfall will keep afternoon high
temperatures 10 to 20 degrees below normal Sunday through
Tuesday, with Monday likely being the chilliest day of the week.
* Stay tuned to the National Hurricane Center by visiting
www.hurricanes.gov for the latest on Hilary.</description>
