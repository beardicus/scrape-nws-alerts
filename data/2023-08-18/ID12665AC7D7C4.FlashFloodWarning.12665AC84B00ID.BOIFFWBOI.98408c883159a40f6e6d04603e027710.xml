<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued August 18 at 7:05PM MDT until August 18 at 10:00PM MDT by NWS Boise</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Boise has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
The Four Corners Fire burn scar in...
Southeastern Adams County in southwestern Idaho...
Northeastern Gem County in southwestern Idaho...
West Central Valley County in southwestern Idaho...
* Until 1000 PM MDT.
* At 705 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing
heavy rain over the Four Corners Fire Burn Scar. Between 0.2 and
0.4 inches of rain have fallen. The expected rainfall rate is 1 to
2 inches in 20 minutes. Additional rainfall amounts of 0.5 to 0.8
inches are possible in the warned area. Flash flooding is ongoing
or expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving out of the burn area. The debris flow can consist of rock,
mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms in and around
the Four Corners Fire Burn Scar.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flooding of areas in and around the Four Corners Fire
Burn Scar.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
EXPECTED RAINFALL RATE...1-2 INCHES IN 20 MINUTES</description>
<instruction>This is a life threatening situation. Heavy rainfall will cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks...streams...and
ditches in the Four Corners Fire Burn Scar. Severe debris flows can
also be anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may be washed
away in places. If you encounter flood waters...climb to safety.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry washes is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.</instruction>
