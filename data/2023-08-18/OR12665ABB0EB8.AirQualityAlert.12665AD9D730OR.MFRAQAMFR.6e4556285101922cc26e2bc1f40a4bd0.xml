<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON PDT SUNDAY...
Oregon Department of Environmental Quality has issued an Air
Quality Advisory...in effect until noon PDT Sunday.
Wildfires burning in the region combined with forecast conditions
will cause air quality levels to fluctuate and could be at unhealthy
levels, especially in portions of southern Josephine and Jackson
counties. Brief improvement is possible this afternoon, but as
always, smoke levels can change rapidly depending on the weather.
Another increase in smoke is expected Saturday.
Check current conditions on the Oregon Smoke Information Blog
oregonsmoke.org, DEQ’s Air Quality Index, or by downloading the free
OregonAIR app on your smartphone.
- Smoke can irritate the eyes and lungs and worsen some medical conditions.
People most at risk include infants and young children, people
with heart or lung disease, older adults and pregnant people.
- Protect yourself and your family when smoke levels are high:
- Stay inside if possible. Keep windows and doors closed. If it’s too
hot, run air conditioning on recirculate or consider moving to a
cooler location. Avoid strenuous outdoor activity.
- Use a high efficiency particulate air(HEPA) filter in indoor
ventilation systems or portable air purifiers.
- Be aware of smoke in your area and avoid places with the highest
levels.
- If you have a breathing plan for a medical condition, be sure to
follow it and keep any needed medications refilled.
