<description>...Shower and thunderstorm chances continue...
...Heavy rain and flood potential Sunday-Monday...
* Another round of scattered to widespread showers and
thunderstorms will occur once again Saturday afternoon and
evening.
* Major Hurricane Hilary in the eastern Pacific is expected to
make landfall Sunday PM or early Monday AM along northern Baja
of California or extreme southern coastal California. While this
system will rapidly weaken into a remnant low by the time it
reaches Nevada, significant amounts of moisture will bring
periods of heavy rainfall to the region Sunday afternoon through
Monday. The greatest threat for flooding is across the Basin &amp;
Range and the eastern Sierra. Please see the Flash Flood Watch
for additional details. Have multiple ways to receive alerts in
case flood warnings are issued, and never drive through flooded
roadways.
* Abundant cloud cover and rainfall will keep afternoon high
temperatures 10 to 20 degrees below normal Sunday through
Tuesday, with Monday likely being the chilliest day of the week.
* The center of what is left of Hilary will move through central
Nevada on Monday. Across the Basin and Range, expect
breezy/gusty conditions with gusts of 30-40 mph and locally
higher inside any intense storm cores. If the track of Hilary
shifts farther west, winds may become gustier for more of the
region.
* Stay tuned to the National Hurricane Center by visiting
www.hurricanes.gov for the latest on Hilary.</description>
