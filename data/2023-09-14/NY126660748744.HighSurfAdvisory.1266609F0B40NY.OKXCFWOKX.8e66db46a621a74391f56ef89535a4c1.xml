<headline>High Surf Advisory issued September 14 at 5:37PM EDT until September 16 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT SATURDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM FRIDAY TO
3 AM EDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 7
to 11 ft, building to 10 to 16 feet on Friday into Saturday
morning in the surf zone, then gradually subsiding through the
weekend. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, a reasonable worst
case of 1 to 2 ft of inundation above ground level expected in
vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...Southwest Suffolk, Southeast Suffolk and Southern
Nassau Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT Saturday.
For the High Rip Current Risk, through Saturday evening. For
the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 6 PM Friday to 3 AM EDT
Sunday, particularly during the times of high tides.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Minor flooding is likely in the most
vulnerable locations near the waterfront and shoreline,
particularly along the north facing shorelines of the south
fork of Long Island and the north facing shorelines of the
barrier islands. As much as 1 to 2 feet of inundation above
ground level is possible, which will cause shallow flooding on
some roads and low lying property including parking lots,
parks, lawns and homes/businesses with basements near the
waterfront.
* SWIMMING IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions
Tonight through Saturday. Life-threatening rip currents are
likely for all people entering the surf zone. Anyone visiting
the beaches should stay out of the surf. Rip currents can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* BEACH EROSION AND FLOODING IMPACTS...Large breaking waves will
result in widespread areas of dune erosion and scattered
overwashes through Saturday. This may result in scattered
areas of minor to moderate flooding of roadways and vulnerable
structures behind protective dunes.
* FORECAST CHALLENGES...There is still uncertainty in the timing
of peak surge relative to the times of high tide Friday Night
into Saturday, the magnitude of wave setup effects over
several tidal cycles, and the fact that Lee is expected to
transition to an extra- tropical storm. For this reason, this
coastal flood forecast represents a reasonable worst case
forecast, to include a safety margin for preparation.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
