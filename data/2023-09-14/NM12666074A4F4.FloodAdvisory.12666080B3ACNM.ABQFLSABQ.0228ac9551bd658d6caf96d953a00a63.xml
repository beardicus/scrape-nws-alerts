<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
In hilly or mountainous terrain there are numerous of low water
crossings which are potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not
attempt to cross flooded roads. Find an alternate route.
Even 6 inches of fast-moving flood water can knock you off your feet
and a depth of 2 feet will float your car. Never try to walk, swim,
or drive through such swift water. If you come upon flood waters,
stop, turn around and go another way.</instruction>
