<headline>High Surf Advisory issued September 14 at 8:03PM EDT until September 16 at 5:00AM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH FRIDAY EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EDT
FRIDAY NIGHT...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 AM EDT SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 5 to
10 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards Statement,
dangerous rip currents and large breaking waves expected in the
surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, 1 to 2 feet of
inundation above ground level expected in low- lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...West Carteret and Coastal Onslow Counties.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, through Friday
evening. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until midnight EDT
Friday night. For the High Surf Advisory, until 5 AM EDT
Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Up to 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level
is possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways resulting in a low threat of property damage. Some
roads and low lying property including parking lots, parks,
lawns, and homes adjacent to the waterfront will experience
shallow flooding. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions
and localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the
best swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Dangerous
shore break can throw a swimmer or surfer head first into the
bottom causing neck and back injuries.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most critical factor in this event
will be the powerful ocean wave run up, which will bring
seawater up and over vulnerable dune structures, across roads,
and onto properties.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
