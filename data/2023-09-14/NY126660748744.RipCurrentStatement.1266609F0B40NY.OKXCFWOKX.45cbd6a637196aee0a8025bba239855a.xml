<headline>Rip Current Statement issued September 14 at 5:37PM EDT until September 16 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT SATURDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY EVENING
THROUGH LATE SATURDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 3
to 5 feet, building to 4 to 8 feet on Friday into Saturday
morning in the surf zone, then gradually subsiding through the
weekend. For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip
currents. For the Coastal Flood Statement, a reasonable worst
case of up to 1 ft of inundation above ground level expected
in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...Kings (Brooklyn) County.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT Saturday.
For the High Rip Current Risk, through Saturday evening. For
the Coastal Flood Statement, from Friday evening through late
Saturday night.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Brief minor flooding of the most
vulnerable locations near the waterfront and shoreline.
* SWIMMING IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions
Tonight through Saturday. Life-threatening rip currents are
likely for all people entering the surf zone. Anyone visiting
the beaches should stay out of the surf. Rip currents can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* BEACH EROSION AND FLOODING IMPACTS...Scattered areas of dune
erosion are likely through Saturday.
* FORECAST CHALLENGES...There is still uncertainty in the timing
of peak surge relative to the times of high tide Friday Night
into Saturday, the magnitude of wave setup effects over
several tidal cycles, and the fact that Lee is expected to
transition to an extra- tropical storm. For this reason, this
coastal flood forecast represents a reasonable worst case
forecast, to include a safety margin for preparation.</description>
<instruction>Do not drive through flooded roadways.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
