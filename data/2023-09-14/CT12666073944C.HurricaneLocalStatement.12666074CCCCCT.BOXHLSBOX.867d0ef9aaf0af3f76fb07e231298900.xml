SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Lee is forecast to pass offshore of southern New England on
Saturday but its impacts will extend far from the storm`s center. Lee
will bring rough surf and possible storm surge flooding, damaging
winds, and bands of heavy rain to at least coastal areas of
Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
The following are the primary hazards of concern with Lee:
* Damaging wind - Winds will increase on Friday and remain gusty
through Saturday night. Tropical storm force winds are expected late
Friday night and Saturday near the coast, where downed branches or
trees are possible since trees are fully leafed and root systems may
be weakened from saturated soils. These winds and high seas will also
be dangerous for mariners.
* Storm surge - Storm surge flooding is possible on the bay side of
Cape Cod and the northern side of Nantucket, including Nantucket
Harbor, late Friday and Saturday. In addition, ocean beaches will
experience dangerous rip currents and significant beach erosion
through the weekend.
* Flooding rainfall - Bands of heavy rain may result in flash flooding
Friday night and Saturday, mainly near the coast. Rainfall totals of
1 to 4 inches are possible in a short period of time.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
coastal Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Potential impacts in this area
include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across Southern New England, little to no impact is
anticipated.
* SURGE:
Prepare for storm surge flooding having possible significant impacts
across the bay side of Cape Cod and the northern side of Nantucket,
including Nantucket Harbor. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Significant beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong
and numerous rip currents.
Also, prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across the rest of the eastern Massachusetts coast. This
includes minor inundation of coastal roads and low lying areas.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across eastern Massachusetts. Potential impacts
include:
- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter currents.
Small streams, creeks, and ditches may become swollen and
overflow in spots.
- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually
vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding of water
occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become
near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge
closures.
Elsewhere across Southern New England, little to no impact is
anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
Keep cell phones well charged. Cell phone chargers for automobiles
can be helpful, but be aware of your risk for deadly carbon monoxide
poisoning if your car is left idling in a garage or other poorly
ventilated area.
If in a place that is vulnerable to high wind, such as near large
trees, a manufactured home, upper floors of a high-rise building, or
on a boat, consider moving to a safer shelter before the onset of
strong winds or flooding.
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
near the ocean, in a low-lying or poor drainage area, or near an
already swollen river, plan to move to safe shelter on higher ground.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
