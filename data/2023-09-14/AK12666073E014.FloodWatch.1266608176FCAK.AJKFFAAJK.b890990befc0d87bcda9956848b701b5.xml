<headline>Flood Watch issued September 14 at 9:09AM AKDT  by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...The following areas, Central Inner Channels and Eastern
Gulf Coast. This includes the cities of Sitka, Juneau, And
Petersburg.
* WHEN...Through Friday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, other low-lying areas and flood-prone locations.
Area creeks and streams are running high and could flood with more
heavy rain. Isolated landslides are possible in areas of steep
terrain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- An atmospheric river has so far brought around 1 to 2 inches
of rainfall to the Sitka and Juneau areas since Wednesday
evening. The Petersburg area has only had around 0.5 inches
so far. Some of these rain rates have been heavy with upwards
of 0.25 inches per hour observed at times. The heavy rainfall
is expected to continue through the day and start to shift
east with another 1 to 2 inches for the Juneau and Sitka
areas and up to 2.5 inches for Petersburg. Confidence has
increased on timing with the heavier rainfall now expected to
move out of the Juneau and Sitka areas by Thursday Evening,
while the Petersburg area will stay in the heavy rain until
early Friday morning.
Area rivers and streams are starting to show rises in water
levels but no flooding has been observed yet. Minor flooding
is possible especially for the smaller streams as they
respond to the heavy rain.
- All residents on or near mountain slopes should be prepared for
possible landslides.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
