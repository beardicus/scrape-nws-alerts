<headline>High Surf Advisory issued September 14 at 11:50AM EDT until September 16 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT SATURDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 7 to
11 ft, building to 10 to 16 feet on Friday into Saturday
morning in the surf zone, then gradually subsiding through the
weekend. For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Southwest Suffolk, Southeast Suffolk and Southern
Nassau Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT Saturday.
For the High Rip Current Risk, through Saturday evening.
* SWIMMING IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions
Tonight through Saturday. Life-threatening rip currents are
likely for all people entering the surf zone. Anyone visiting
the beaches should stay out of the surf. Rip currents can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* BEACH EROSION AND FLOODING IMPACTS...Large breaking waves will
result in widespread areas of dune erosion and scattered
overwashes through Saturday. This will likely result in
scattered flooding of roadways and vulnerable structures behind
protective dunes.</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
