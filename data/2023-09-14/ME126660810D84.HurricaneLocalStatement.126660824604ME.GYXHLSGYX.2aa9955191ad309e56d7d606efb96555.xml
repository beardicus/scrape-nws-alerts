<description>This product covers NEW HAMPSHIRE AND WESTERN MAINE
**Tropical Storm Warnings Remain in Effect as Lee Approaches**
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Coastal Cumberland,
Coastal Rockingham, Coastal Waldo, Coastal York, Interior
Waldo, Knox, Lincoln, and Sagadahoc
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 760 miles south-southeast of Portland ME or about 720
miles south-southeast of Portsmouth NH
- 32.9N 67.6W
- Storm Intensity 85 mph
- Movement North or 10 degrees at 14 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Lee is currently a category 1 hurricane as of 11 PM this
evening and continues to move north and expand in size. The northward
movement will continue through the end of the week, bringing it into
the Gulf of Maine late Friday night or early Saturday. As the storm
moves north, it is expected to continue a slow weakening trend , but
the wind field will continue to expand significantly.
Therefore, tropical storm conditions are expected along the coast and
may develop as early as Friday evening, with the threat continuing
through Saturday evening. The strongest winds are expected across
coastal portions of New Hampshire and Maine.
Large, pounding surf in addition to one to three feet of storm surge
will bring the potential for beach erosion and minor to moderate
coastal flooding.
Heavy rainfall is also possible, particularly across the Midcoast of
Maine where localized flooding will be possible.
There remains some uncertainty with regards to the exact track of Lee,
which will play a role in the level of impacts experienced across the
area, but confidence is higher for locations farther east seeing
more impacts. Please check back frequently for the latest updates.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for dangerous wind having possible significant impacts across
coastal New Hampshire and western Maine. Potential impacts in this
area include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. Mobile
homes may be damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured
lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Numerous large trees snapped or uprooted, leading to downed
power lines.
- Many roads are impassable from debris, caused by downed trees
and power lines. Many bridges, causeways, and access routes
impassable.
- Numerous power and communications outages likely.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts. Potential impacts include:
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter currents.
Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may become swollen
and overflow in spots.
- Flood possible in a few places where rapid ponding of water
occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become
near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge
closures.
- Backed up drainage systems near the coast could exacerbate the
flooding from rainfall.
* SURGE:
Prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited impacts
across coastal New Hampshire and western Maine. Potential impacts in
this area include:
- Localized inundation of up to 1 foot mainly along low-lying
spots on the immediate shorelines and in tidal affected
riverine areas farther inland. Storm surge flooding could be
accentuated by large waves in vulnerable wave action shoreline
locations.
- Sections of near-shore roads, causeways, and parking lots
become overspread with surge water. Dangerous driving
conditions in places where surge water covers the road.
- Minor to moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching
dunes, mainly in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip
currents.
- Minor damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. A few
small craft broken away from moorings. No damage to revetments
expected.
* TORNADOES:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time across NEW
HAMPSHIRE AND WESTERN MAINE.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
For those not under evacuation orders, understand that there are
inherent risks to evacuation (such as traffic congestion, accidents,
and driving in bad weather), so evacuate only if necessary. Help keep
roadways open for those that are under evacuation orders.
If you are exceptionally vulnerable to wind or water hazards from
tropical systems, consider voluntary evacuation, especially if being
officially recommended. Relocate to a predetermined shelter or safe
destination.
If evacuating away from the area or relocating to a nearby shelter,
leave early before weather conditions become hazardous.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and take necessary
actions to secure your home or business. Deliberate efforts should be
underway to protect life and property. Ensure that your Emergency
Supplies Kit is stocked and ready.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track as there are inherent forecast uncertainties
which must be taken into account.
If you live in a place that is particularly vulnerable to high wind,
such as a mobile home, an upper floor of a high rise building, or on
a boat, plan to move to safe shelter. Take enough supplies for you
and your family for several days.
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
near the ocean or a large inland lake, in a low lying or poor
drainage area, in a valley, or near an already swollen river, plan to
move to safe shelter on higher ground
Always heed the advice of local officials and comply with any orders
that are issued. Do not needlessly jeopardize your life or the lives
of others.
When securing your property, outside preparations should be conducted
as soon as possible before conditions deteriorate. The onset of
strong gusty winds and heavy rain can cause certain preparedness
activities to become unsafe.
Be sure to let friends and other family members know of your
intentions and whereabouts for surviving the storm. For emergency
purposes, have someone located away from the threatened area serve as
your point of contact. Share vital contact information with others.
Keep cell phones handy and well charged.
Be a Good Samaritan and check on those who may not be fully aware of
the situation or who are unable to make personal preparations.
Visitors to the area should become familiar with nearby surroundings.
If you are a visitor, know the name of the county or parish in which
you are located and where it is relative to current watches and
warnings. If staying at a hotel, ask the management staff about their
onsite disaster plan. Listen for evacuation orders, especially
pertaining to area visitors.
Closely monitor NOAA Weather Radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for possible changes to the
forecast.
