- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Barnstable MA, Dukes
MA, Eastern Essex MA, Eastern Norfolk MA, Eastern Plymouth MA,
Nantucket MA, Southern Bristol MA, Southern Plymouth MA,
Suffolk MA, and Western Plymouth MA

- Storm Intensity 85 mph
- Movement North or 10 degrees at 14 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Lee is forecast to pass offshore of southern New England on
Saturday but its impacts will extend far from the storm`s center,
mainly affecting the Massachusetts coastline.
The following are the primary hazards of concern with Lee:
* Damaging wind - Winds will increase on Friday and remain gusty through
Saturday night. Tropical storm force winds are expected late Friday
night and Saturday near the coast, especially on Cape Cod and the
Islands, where downed trees are possible. These winds combined with
high seas will also be dangerous for mariners.
* Coastal Flooding - Moderate flooding is likely on the bay side of Cape
Cod and on the northern side of Nantucket, around high tide late
Friday night and again early Saturday afternoon. Flooding could be as
deep as 1 to 2 feet in these areas. Along the rest of the eastern
Massachusetts coast, minor flooding is expected with flooding less
than one foot deep. Large waves could result in debris on coastal
roads.
* High Surf - Dangerous surf with large breaking waves will occur along
Massachusetts and Rhode Island coasts along with dangerous rip
currents at ocean beaches.
* Flooding rainfall - Bands of heavy rain may result in localized flash
flooding, mainly on Cape Cod and Nantucket. 1 to 3 inches of rain
could fall in a short period of time.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
coastal Massachusetts. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across Southern New England, little to no impact is
anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across Cape Cod and Nantucket. Potential impacts
include:
- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter currents.
Small streams, creeks, and ditches may become swollen and
overflow in spots.
- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually
vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding of water
occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become
near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge
closures.
Elsewhere across Southern New England, little to no impact is
anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
Keep cell phones well charged. Cell phone chargers for automobiles can
be helpful, but be aware of your risk for deadly carbon monoxide
poisoning if your car is left idling in a garage or other poorly
ventilated area.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
