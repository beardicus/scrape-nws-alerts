<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued September 14 at 3:14PM EDT until September 17 at 5:00AM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM FRIDAY TO 5 AM EDT
SUNDAY...
* WHAT...A reasonable worst case of 1 to 2 ft of inundation above
ground level expected in vulnerable areas near the waterfront
and shoreline.
* WHERE...In Connecticut, Southern Fairfield, Southern New
Haven, Southern Middlesex and Southern New London Counties. In
New York, Southern Westchester County.
* WHEN...From 7 PM Friday to 5 AM EDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding is likely in the most vulnerable
locations near the waterfront and shoreline. As much as 1 to 2
feet of inundation above ground level is possible, which will
cause shallow flooding on some roads and low lying property
including parking lots, parks, lawns and homes/businesses with
basements near the waterfront.
* FORECAST CHALLENGES...There is still uncertainty in the timing
of peak surge relative to the times of high tide Friday Night
into Saturday, the magnitude of wave setup effects over several
tidal cycles, and the fact that Lee is expected to transition to
an extra- tropical storm. For this reason, this coastal flood
forecast represents a reasonable worst case forecast, to include
a safety margin for preparation.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
