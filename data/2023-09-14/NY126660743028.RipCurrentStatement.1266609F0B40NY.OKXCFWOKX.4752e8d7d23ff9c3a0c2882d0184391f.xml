<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT SATURDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM FRIDAY TO 3 AM EDT
SUNDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 4 to
6 feet, building to 6 to 10 feet on Friday into Saturday
morning in the surf zone, then gradually subsiding through the
weekend. For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents..
For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents. For the
Coastal Flood Advisory, a reasonable worst case of 1 to 2 ft of
inundation above ground level expected in vulnerable areas near
the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...Southern Queens County.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT Saturday. For
the High Rip Current Risk, through Saturday evening. For the
Coastal Flood Advisory, from 6 PM Friday to 3 AM EDT Sunday,
particularly during the times of high tides.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Minor flooding is likely in the most
vulnerable locations near the waterfront and shoreline,
particularly along the north facing shorelines of the Rockaways.
As much as 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible, which will cause shallow flooding on some roads and
low lying property including parking lots, parks, lawns and
homes/businesses with basements near the waterfront.
* SWIMMING IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions
Tonight through Saturday. Life-threatening rip currents are
likely for all people entering the surf zone. Anyone visiting
the beaches should stay out of the surf. Rip currents can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* BEACH EROSION AND FLOODING IMPACTS...Scattered areas of dune
erosion and localized overwashes are likely through Saturday,
This may result in localized minor flooding of roadways and
vulnerable structures behind protective dunes.
* FORECAST CHALLENGES...There is still uncertainty in the timing
of peak surge relative to the times of high tide Friday Night
into Saturday, the magnitude of wave setup effects over several
tidal cycles, and the fact that Lee is expected to transition to
an extra- tropical storm. For this reason, this coastal flood
forecast represents a reasonable worst case forecast, to include
a safety margin for preparation.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
