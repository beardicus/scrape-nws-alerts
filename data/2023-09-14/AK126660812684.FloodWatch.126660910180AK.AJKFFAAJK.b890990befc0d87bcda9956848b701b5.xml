<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...The following areas, Central Inner Channels and Eastern
Gulf Coast. This includes the cities of Sitka, Juneau, And
Petersburg.
* WHEN...Through Friday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, other low-lying areas and flood-prone locations.
Area creeks and streams are running high and could flood with more
heavy rain. Isolated landslides remain possible in areas of steep
terrain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
-   - An atmospheric river has so far brought moderate to heavy
rainfall since Wednesday evening. Some rain rates have been
heavy with upwards of 0.25 inches per hour observed at times.
The heavy rainfall is starting to shift eastward away from
the Sitka and Juneau areas in the central Panhandle. The
Petersburg area will stay in the heavy rainfall until early
Friday morning. Area rivers and streams have been showing
rises in water levels but no flooding has been observed, yet.
Minor flooding is possible especially for the smaller streams
as they respond to the heavy rain.
- All residents on or near mountain slopes should be prepared for
possible landslides.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
