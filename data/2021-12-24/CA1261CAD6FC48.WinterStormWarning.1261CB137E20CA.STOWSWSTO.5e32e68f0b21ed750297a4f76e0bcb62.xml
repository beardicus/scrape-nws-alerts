<description>...Multiple Winter Storms to Impact Mountain and Foothill Travel
through Early Next Week...
.A series of winter storms will bring multiple rounds of mountain
snow and gusty winds through early next week. Scattered mountain
snow showers continue this afternoon with the next heavier round
of snow occurring this evening through Saturday with lower snow
levels. Snow levels will generally be 2000 to 3500 feet but will
be lowering Sunday morning to 1000 to 2500 feet, locally lower.
Activity will become more showery Saturday night with another
round of heavy snow Sunday afternoon and Monday, with some
possible light snow accumulation down into the lower foothills
(1000 feet) Monday evening into early Tuesday morning.
Major travel delays and difficult travel conditions are
anticipated through early next week. Gusty winds will further
reduce visibilities during this event with local whiteout
conditions possible. Holiday travelers should prepare for winter
driving conditions by packing chains, warm winter clothes, and
extra food and water. Foothill locations that do not normally
receive snow should prepare for wintry conditions, especially
from Sunday morning through early Tuesday morning.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST TUESDAY
ABOVE 1000 FEET...
* WHAT...Heavy snow in higher elevations. Travel will be very
difficult to impossible this weekend with snow levels lowering
into the foothills Sunday morning. Tree branches could fall as
well. Additional snow accumulations of 3 to 6 feet, with
localized amounts up to 12 feet, are expected.
* WHERE...Western Plumas County/Lassen Park and West Slope
Northern Sierra Nevada.
* WHEN...Until 10 AM Tuesday.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Be prepared for significant reductions in
visibility at times.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
A Winter Storm Warning for snow means there will be snow covered
roads and limited visibilities. Travel is not recommended while
the warning is in effect. If you must travel, keep an extra
flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case of an
emergency.The latest road conditions for the state you are
calling from can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</description>
