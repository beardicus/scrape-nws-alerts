<description>...Multiple Winter Storms to Impact Mountain and Foothill Travel
through Early Next Week...
.A series of winter storms will bring multiple rounds of mountain
snow and gusty winds through early next week. Scattered mountain
snow showers continue this afternoon with the next heavier round
of snow occurring this evening through Saturday with lower snow
levels. Snow levels will generally be 2000 to 3500 feet but will
be lowering Sunday morning to 1000 to 2500 feet, locally lower.
Activity will become more showery Saturday night with another
round of heavy snow Sunday afternoon and Monday, with some
possible light snow accumulation down into the lower foothills

Major travel delays and difficult travel conditions are

receive snow should prepare for wintry conditions, especially
from Sunday morning through early Tuesday morning.
