<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued December 24 at 10:40PM AKST until December 27 at 6:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH
EARLY MONDAY MORNING THROUGH PORTAGE VALLEY AND EASTERN TURNAGAIN
ARM...
* WHAT...Significant icing possible. Total ice accumulations of
up to four tenths of an inch possible.
* WHERE...Portage Valley and Eastern Turnagain Arm.
* WHEN...From Sunday morning through early Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...Power outages and tree damage are possible due to
the ice. Travel could be extremely hazardous. The hazardous
conditions could impact holiday travel on Sunday and the
Monday morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Any early Sunday morning snow will
quickly transition over to freezing rain through Portage
Valley and Eastern Turnagain Arm. Occasionally heavy
precipitation rates are likely to cause significant icing
along the Seward Highway. For higher elevations of the Seward
Highway, all rain is expected as temperatures rise above
freezing, with the heaviest amounts the further north you go.
However, rain and drizzle falling on the frozen ground will
still cause very slick conditions all along the Seward Highway
corridor.
* Confidence is high that there will be periods of freezing
rain, but much lower on amounts and the timing. Stay tuned for
additional forecast updates.</description>
