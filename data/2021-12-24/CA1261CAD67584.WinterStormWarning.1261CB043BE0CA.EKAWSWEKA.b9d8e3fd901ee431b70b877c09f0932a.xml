<description>...HEAVY MOUNTAIN SNOW EXPECTED DURING THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY...
.A series of cold upper level storm systems will aid in lowering
snow levels to as low as 2000 feet by Saturday afternoon, and

Periods of heavy showers spreading across the cold airmass will
favor significant mountain snowfall beginning this afternoon and
lasting through Monday morning. Travel across mountain roadways
and highway passes will subsequently be difficult if not
impossible.

* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 7 to 24
inches.

hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
