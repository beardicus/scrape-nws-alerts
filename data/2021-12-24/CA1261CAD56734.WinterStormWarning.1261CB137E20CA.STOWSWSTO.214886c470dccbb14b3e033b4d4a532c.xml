<description>...Multiple Winter Storms to Impact Mountain and Foothill Travel
through Early Next Week...
.A series of winter storms will bring multiple rounds of mountain
snow and gusty winds through early next week. Mountain snow
showers will continue today with the next heavier round of snow
occurring this evening through Saturday with lower snow levels.
Snow levels will generally be 2000 to 3500 feet but will be
lowering Sunday morning to 1000 to 2500 feet, locally lower.
Activity will become more showery Saturday night with another
round of heavy snow Sunday afternoon and Monday, with some
possible snow accumulation down into the lower foothills (1000
feet) Tuesday morning.
Major travel delays and difficult travel conditions are
anticipated through early next week. Gusty winds will further
reduce visibilities during this event with local whiteout
conditions possible. Holiday travelers should prepare for winter
driving conditions by packing chains, warm winter clothes, and
extra food and water. Foothill locations that do not normally
receive snow should prepare for winter conditions, especially
from Sunday morning through Tuesday morning.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM SUNDAY TO
10 AM PST TUESDAY ABOVE 1000 FEET...
* WHAT...Moderate to heavy snow expected from 1000 to 3000 feet.
Travel will be very difficult. Total snow accumulations of 4 to
12 inches, with localized amounts up to 2 to 4 feet, are
expected. The highest amounts are expected at or above the upper
foothills.
* WHERE...Northeast Foothills/Sacramento Valley and Motherlode.
* WHEN...4 AM Sunday to 10 AM Tuesday.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Be prepared for significant reductions in
visibility at times.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
A Winter Storm Warning for snow means there will be snow covered
roads and limited visibilities. Travel is not recommended while
the warning is in effect. If you must travel, keep an extra
flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case of an
emergency.The latest road conditions for the state you are
calling from can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</description>
