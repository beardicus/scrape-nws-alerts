<headline>Rip Current Statement issued September 24 at 7:06PM EDT until September 25 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY
EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IS CANCELLED...
* WHAT...Dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Southwest Suffolk County.
* WHEN...Through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...Life-threatening rip currents are likely for all
people entering the surf zone. Anyone visiting the beaches
should stay out of the surf. Rip currents can sweep even the
best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Additional rounds of minor, to possibly
locally moderate coastal flooding are possible into this week,
particularly during the evening high tides for Monday and Tuesday.</description>
<instruction>If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
