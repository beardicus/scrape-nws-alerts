<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 5 PM THIS
AFTERNOON TO 11 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 6 to 10
feet in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, locally
one to two feet of inundation above ground level expected in
vulnerable areas near the waterfront of western Peconic Bay.
* WHERE...Southeast Suffolk County.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Monday evening.
For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT this evening. For
the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 5 PM this afternoon to 11 PM
EDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Minor to locally moderate flooding of the more
vulnerable locations for western portions of Peconic Bay,
mainly in the vicinity of Riverhead. Dangerous swimming and
surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Life-
threatening rip currents are likely for all people entering
the surf zone. Anyone visiting the beaches should stay out of
the surf. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water.
* BEACH EROSION AND FLOODING IMPACTS...Large breaking waves of 6
to 10 ft will cause beach flooding and erosion, with scattered
areas of dune erosion during the time of high tide. The
potential for localized overwashes is low at this time,
limited to the most compromised dune areas.
* SWIMMING IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents are likely for all people
entering the surf zone. Anyone visiting the beaches should
stay out of the surf. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Additional rounds of minor coastal
flooding are possible into this week, particularly during the
afternoon/evening high tides for Monday and Tuesday.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
