...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of up to

one foot of inundation above ground level in low-lying areas
near shorelines and tidal waterways. For the High Rip Current

* IMPACTS...At this level, flooding begins on the most
vulnerable roads in coastal and bayside communities, and along

possible. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
