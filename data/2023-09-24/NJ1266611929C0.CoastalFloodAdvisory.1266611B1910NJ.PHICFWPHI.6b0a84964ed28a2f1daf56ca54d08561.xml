<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM EDT
MONDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to one half foot of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways. For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous
rip currents.
* WHERE...Ocean County, New Jersey. The minor tidal flooding will
be confined mainly to Barnegat Bay and connected tidal
waterways.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 9:00 AM Monday.
For the High Rip Current Risk, through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...At this level, widespread roadway flooding occurs in
coastal and bayside communities and along inland tidal
waterways. Many roads become impassable. Rip currents can sweep
even the best swimmers away from shore and into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Additional rounds of minor tidal flooding
are possible into the new week along with an elevated rip
current risk.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
