<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued September 24 at 2:27AM EDT until September 24 at 7:00AM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 AM EDT THIS
MORNING...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM EDT THIS
MORNING THROUGH THIS EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IS CANCELLED...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, 1 to 2 feet of inundation
above ground level in low-lying soundside areas near tidal
waterways. For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip
currents.
* WHERE...Northern Outer Banks and Hatteras Island.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 7 AM EDT this
morning. For the Beach Hazards Statement, from 8 AM EDT this
morning through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Up to 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible for soundside low-lying areas resulting in a low
threat of property damage. Some roads and low lying property
including parking lots, parks, lawns, and homes adjacent to the
waterfront will experience shallow flooding. Rip currents can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most likely time for strong rip
currents to occur is a couple hours either side of low tide,
which will occur around 9 AM this morning.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
