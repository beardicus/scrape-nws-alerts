<headline>High Surf Advisory issued September 24 at 7:56AM EDT until September 24 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 4
to 10 feet in the surf zone. For the High Rip Current Risk,
dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Kings (Brooklyn), Southwest Suffolk, Southern Queens
and Southern Nassau Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Monday evening.
For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT this evening.
* BEACH EROSION AND FLOODING IMPACTS...Large breaking waves of 4
to 10 ft will cause beach flooding and erosion, with localized
dune erosion possible, during the time of high tide.
* SWIMMING IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents are likely for all people
entering the surf zone. Anyone visiting the beaches should
stay out of the surf. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Additional rounds of minor, to possibly
locally moderate coastal flooding are possible into this week,
particularly during the afternoon/evening high tides for
Monday and Tuesday.</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
