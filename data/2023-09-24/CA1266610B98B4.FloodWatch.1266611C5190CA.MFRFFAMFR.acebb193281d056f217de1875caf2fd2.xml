<description>.The first moderate to heavy rain event of the season will arrive
this evening into Monday. While this rainfall will be mostly
beneficial as we are coming out of the dry season, there is a risk
that moderate to heavy rainfall could produce debris flows on this
season`s burn scars.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THIS EVENING THROUGH MONDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Periods of moderate to heavy rain could result in debris
flows and/or landslides on this season`s burn scars.
* WHERE...In northern California, this includes the McKinney burn
scar from 2022 and the Head Fire. In southwest Oregon, this
includes the Smith River Complex, the Flat Fire, the Anvil Fire
and the Tyee Complex.
* WHEN...From this evening through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...Debris flows due to moderate to heavy rainfall on burn
scars may result in road closures as well as flooding of creeks,
streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations. Low-water
crossings may be flooded. Storm drains and ditches may become
clogged with debris.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
