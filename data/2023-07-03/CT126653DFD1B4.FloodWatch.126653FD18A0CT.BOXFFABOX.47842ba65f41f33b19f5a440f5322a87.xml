<headline>Flood Watch issued July 03 at 10:13AM EDT  by NWS Boston</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE TUESDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of northern Connecticut, including the following
areas, Hartford CT, Tolland CT and Windham CT. Portions of
Massachusetts, including the following areas, Central Middlesex
MA, Eastern Franklin MA, Eastern Hampden MA, Eastern Hampshire MA,
Northern Middlesex MA, Northern Worcester MA, Southern Worcester
MA and Western Essex MA. Portions of northern Rhode Island,
including the following area, Northwest Providence RI.
* WHEN...Through late Tuesday night.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Radar and gage estimates indicate two to localized amounts as
much as four inches fell across portions of western and
central Massachusetts and northern Connecticut yesterday
afternoon and evening. Multiple rounds of showers and
thunderstorms are anticipated through July 4th, which may
produce additional rain amounts between one and up to three
inches of rain. Slow moving and re-developing downpours may
elevate the risk for urban and street flooding along with
localized areas of rapid-onset flash flooding. Excessive
runoff will also result in rises on streams, creeks and
tributaries to potentially over bankfull.
