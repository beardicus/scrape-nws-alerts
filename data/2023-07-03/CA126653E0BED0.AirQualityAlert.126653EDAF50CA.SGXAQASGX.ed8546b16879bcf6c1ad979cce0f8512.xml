<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT DUE TO ELEVATED LEVELS OF FINE PARTICULATE
MATTER...
The South Coast AQMD has issued an air quality alert in the South
Coast Air Basin due to high levels of fine particulate matter. The
air quality alert is in effect from 5 PM Tuesday through Wednesday
evening.
Exposure to particle pollution can cause serious health problems,
aggravate heart and lung disease, cause asthma attacks and acute
bronchitis, and increase risk of respiratory infections. People with
respiratory or heart disease, older adults, and children are
particularly susceptible.
Check air quality levels and take appropriate action as needed.
When air quality index (AQI) levels are Unhealthy for Sensitive
Groups (orange), people with heart or lung disease, pregnant women,
children, and older adults should limit prolonged or heavy outdoor
exertion. When air quality reaches Unhealthy (red) AQI levels,
everyone may experience adverse health effects and sensitive groups
should avoid prolonged time outdoors. At Very Unhealthy (purple) AQI
levels, sensitive groups should avoid all outdoor physical activity
and everyone else should avoid prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion.
To help keep indoor air clean during periods of poor air quality,
close all windows and doors and run your air conditioner and/or an
air purifier. If possible, do not use whole house fans or swamp
coolers that bring in outside air. Avoid burning wood in your
fireplace or firepit and minimize sources of indoor air pollution
such as candles, incense, pan-frying, and grilling. Limit the use of
gasoline powered lawn and garden equipment.
