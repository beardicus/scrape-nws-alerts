<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 7 AM TUESDAY TO 7 PM PDT
WEDNESDAY FOR HOT, DRY AND UNSTABLE CONDITIONS FOR FIRE WEATHER
ZONE 655...
The National Weather Service in Seattle has issued a Red Flag
Warning for hot, dry and unstable conditions, which is in effect
from 7 AM Tuesday to 7 PM PDT Wednesday. This replaces the Fire
Weather Watch.
* AFFECTED AREA...Fire Weather Zone 655 Black Hills and
Southwest Interior Lowlands.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...As low as 15 to 20 percent during the
afternoon.
* TEMPERATURES...In the mid 80s to the lower 90s.
* HAINES...6
* IMPACTS...A dry and unstable air mass with warm temperatures
can contribute to active fire behavior. In western Washington,
significant growth on existing fires takes place under such
conditions. If a fire were to begin, air quality may diminish
in the surrounding area.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Relative humidities will increase overnight
Tuesday but again reach critical levels Wednesday afternoon.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either imminent or occurring now. Any fires that develop will
likely spread quickly. Outdoor burning is not recommended.</instruction>
