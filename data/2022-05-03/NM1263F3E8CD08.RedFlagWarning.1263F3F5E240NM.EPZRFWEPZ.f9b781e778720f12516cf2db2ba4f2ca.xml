occasionally be seen outside of the Gila Region. Winds will
strengthen area wide Wednesday afternoon with the strongest winds
in the higher elevations of Grant, Sierra, and Otero Counties. A
cold front will move through the area from north to south
Wednesday afternoon, bringing with it drier air. Winds will
diminish a few hours after sunset both days. Overnight RH
recoveries across the Sacramento mtns and lowlands will only reach
15 to 25% into early Thursday morning.
