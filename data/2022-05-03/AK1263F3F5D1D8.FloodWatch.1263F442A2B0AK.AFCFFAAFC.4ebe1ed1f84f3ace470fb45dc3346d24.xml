<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR A POTENTIAL ICE JAM ON THE KUSKOKWIM RIVER AT
CROOKED CREEK IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam is possible.
* WHERE...Kuskokwim River at Crooked Creek.
* WHEN...Through Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks.
Ice jam flooding has high uncertainty. Impacts could range between
localized high water and severe flooding. Now is the time to take
precautions. Where possible, move items to higher ground and prepare
your community for possible flooding.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- There is potential for an ice jam to develop around the
village of Crooked Creek.  The Riverwatch reconnaissance
flight on Tuesday afternoon observed numerous large cracks
and pressure ridges which are indicative of moving ice in the
miles upstream of the community and many miles of intact and
stationary ice downstream of the community. In addition,
river ice thickness around Crooked Creek was particularly
thick this winter. If an ice jam were to form, water levels
would rise quickly.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
