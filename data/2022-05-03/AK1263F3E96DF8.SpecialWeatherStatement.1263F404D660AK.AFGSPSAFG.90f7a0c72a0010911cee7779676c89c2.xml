<description>...Rising Water Levels and Ice Jam Potential on Interior Rivers...
Spring breakup process continues in the Middle Tanana Valley and
across the Interior. Warm temperatures last week and over the
weekend have produced significant melting of the snowpack. The
snow pack melt off water is rapidly making its way into the
waterways of the Interior. Rivers and stream around the Interior
continue to show significant rises on the gages that are not ice
effected. The Chena River is mainly open up to the 40 mile bridge
on Chena Hot Springs Road. The Chena, Little Chena, Salcha,
Chatanika,Tanana, GoodPaster and Nenana rivers are all forecasted
to rise over the next several days. Residents along these rivers
should prepare for rising water levels with with possible
inundation of low low lying areas.
Significant ice remains on the Upper Chena and portions of the
Little Chena and Tanana Rivers. Local ice jams have been reported
on the Chena River upstream of Hunts Cabin with local inundations
in low lying areas near the river. Rising water levels could lift
the ice at any time and move in sheets with the potential for ice
dams to form. Residents should be vigilant if they are near rivers
and streams and watch for rapidly rising water. Significant
overflow continues on many of the waterways in the Interior. Local
ponding of water in the urban areas will continue to be an issue.
