fuels continue to dry out. Winds will strengthen area wide
Wednesday afternoon with the strongest winds in the higher
elevations of Grant, Sierra, and Otero Counties. A cold front will
move through the area north to south Wednesday afternoon, bringing
with it drier air. Winds will diminish a few hours after sunset
both days. Overnight RH recoveries will be decent early Wednesday
morning, but will be 10-20% lower early Thursday morning.
