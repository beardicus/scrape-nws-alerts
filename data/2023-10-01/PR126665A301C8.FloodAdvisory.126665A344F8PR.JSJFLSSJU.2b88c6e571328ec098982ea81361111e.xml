Rio Grande.

impassable. River or stream flows are elevated.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1057 AM AST, Radar Doppler indicated heavy rain has ended.
However, excessive runoff persists causing some flooding in
roadways in some areas. USGS river sensors indicate that Rio
Grande and Rio Espiritu have elevated streamflows. Therefore,
urban and small stream flooding are still likely. Between 1
and 3 inches of rain have fallen.
