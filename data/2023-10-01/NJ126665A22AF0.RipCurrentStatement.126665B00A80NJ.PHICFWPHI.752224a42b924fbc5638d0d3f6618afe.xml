<headline>Rip Current Statement issued October 01 at 5:08AM EDT until October 01 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Philadelphia - Mount Holly</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 PM EDT THIS
AFTERNOON...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents
will occur. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to one foot of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...The coast of Monmouth County, New Jersey.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through this evening. For
the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 2:00 PM this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...At this level, flooding begins on the most vulnerable
roads in coastal and bayside communities, and along inland
tidal waterways. Some partial or full road closures are
possible. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore and into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Tidal departures and the astronomical high
tide levels will be on the decrease during the new week. While
some spotty minor tidal flooding remains possible on Monday, it
should not be impactful enough to warrant another Coastal Flood
Advisory.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
