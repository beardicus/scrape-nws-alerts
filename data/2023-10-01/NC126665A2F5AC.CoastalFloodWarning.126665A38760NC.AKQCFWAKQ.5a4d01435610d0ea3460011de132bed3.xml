<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued October 01 at 10:27AM EDT until October 01 at 2:00PM EDT by NWS Wakefield</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 PM EDT THIS
AFTERNOON...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, a high rip current
risk. For the Coastal Flood Warning, one to two feet of
inundation above ground level expected in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...Eastern Currituck County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, until 2 PM EDT this
afternoon. For the Beach Hazards Statement, until 8 PM EDT
this evening.
* IMPACTS...Widespread flooding of vulnerable areas will result
in an elevated threat of property damage to homes and
businesses near the waterfront and shoreline. Water will be 1
to 2 feet above ground level in some areas resulting in a
sufficient depth to close numerous roads and threaten homes
and businesses. Flooding will extend inland from the
waterfront along tidal rivers and bays resulting in some road
closures and flooding of vehicles. Breaking waves will result
in rough surf conditions and a high risk of rip currents.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
