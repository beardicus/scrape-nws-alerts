<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued October 01 at 8:36AM EDT until October 02 at 2:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 PM EDT
MONDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO 8 PM
EDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, 2 to 4 feet of inundation
above ground level in low- lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways. For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip
currents, large breaking waves, and strong longshore currents in
the surf zone. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves
of 6 to 9 feet expected in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Hatteras Island.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, until 2 PM EDT Monday.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, until 8 PM EDT this evening.
For the High Surf Advisory, from 2 PM this afternoon to 8 PM
EDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Numerous roads may be closed. Low lying property
including homes, businesses, and some critical infrastructure
will be inundated. Some shoreline erosion will occur.
Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach
erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw
a swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom causing neck
and back injuries. Strong longshore currents will create
dangerous swimming conditions.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
