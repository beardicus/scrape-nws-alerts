<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued October 01 at 5:08AM EDT until October 01 at 2:00PM EDT by NWS Philadelphia - Mount Holly</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 PM EDT THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Up to one foot of inundation above ground level in low-
lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...Tidal areas in Cumberland County, New Jersey.
* WHEN...Until 2:00 PM this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...At this level, flooding begins on the most vulnerable
roads in coastal and bayside communities, and along inland
tidal waterways. Some partial or full road closures are
possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Tidal departures and the astronomical high
tide levels will be on the decrease during the new week. While
some spotty minor tidal flooding remains possible on Monday, it
should not be impactful enough to warrant another Coastal Flood
Advisory.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
