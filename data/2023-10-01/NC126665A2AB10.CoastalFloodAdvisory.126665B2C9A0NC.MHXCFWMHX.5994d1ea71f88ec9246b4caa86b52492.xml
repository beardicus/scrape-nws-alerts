EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO 8 PM
EDT MONDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IS CANCELLED...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, one to three feet of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways. For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous
rip currents, large breaking waves, and strong longshore
currents in the surf zone. For the High Surf Advisory, large
breaking waves of 6 to 9 feet expected in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Northern Outer Banks.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 2 PM EDT Monday.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, until 8 PM EDT this evening.
For the High Surf Advisory, from 2 PM this afternoon to 8 PM
EDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Up to 1 to 3 of inundation above ground level is
possible in some areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in an elevated threat of property damage. Flooding
will extend inland from the waterfront threatening some homes
and businesses. Numerous road closures and flooding of vehicles
will be possible. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore
break can throw a swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom
causing neck and back injuries. Strong longshore currents will
create dangerous swimming conditions.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
