<headline>Rip Current Statement issued October 01 at 2:07PM EDT until October 01 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Philadelphia - Mount Holly</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to one half-foot of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways. For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous
rip currents.
* WHERE...Delaware Beaches.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 6 PM EDT this
evening. For the High Rip Current Risk, until 8 PM EDT this
evening.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Rip currents can sweep even
the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Tidal departures and the astronomical high
tide levels will be on the decrease during the new week. While
some spotty minor tidal flooding remains possible on Monday, it
should not be impactful enough to warrant another Coastal Flood
Advisory.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
