masks if outside. High dust concentrations can cause respiratory
problems...decrease lung activity...aggravate asthma...and lead
to potential heart-related problems...especially with
children...elderly...or those with pre-existing respiratory
conditions.
If you encounter blowing dust or blowing sand on the roadway or
see it approaching, pull off the road as far as possible and put
your vehicle in park. Turn the lights all the way off and keep
your foot off the brake pedal. Remember, Pull Aside, Stay Alive.</instruction>
