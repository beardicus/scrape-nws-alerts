<headline>High Wind Warning issued April 06 at 8:55PM CDT until April 07 at 8:00PM CDT by NWS Goodland</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING NOW IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM MDT /10 AM CDT/ TO
7 PM MDT /8 PM CDT/ THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Northwest winds at 35 to 50 mph with gusts up to 70 mph.
* WHERE...The entire Tri-State area.
* WHEN...From 9 AM MDT /10 AM CDT/ to 7 PM MDT /8 PM CDT/.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be difficult, especially for high profile
vehicles. Damaging winds may blow down trees and power lines.
Power outages are possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS... Blowing dust is likely due to the strong
winds. Visibility may be suddenly and severely reduced. This
will make travel more hazardous.</description>
<instruction>People with respiratory problems should make preparations to stay
indoors until the storm passes. Be ready for a sudden drop in
visibility to near zero. If you encounter blowing dust or blowing
sand on the roadway or see it approaching, pull off the road as
far as possible and put your vehicle in park. Turn the lights all
the way off and keep your foot off the brake pedal. Remember,
Pull Aside, Stay Alive.
Secure loose outdoor items. If you are driving, watch for objects
blowing across the roadway and into your path. Keep a safe
distance from cars in adjacent lanes as strong gusts could
suddenly push a vehicle outside its lane of travel. Take extra
care in high-profile vehicles such as a truck, van, or SUV, or
when towing a trailer, as these are more prone to be pushed or
even flipped by high winds.</instruction>
