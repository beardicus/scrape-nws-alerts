<description>...HEAVY RAINFALL POSSIBLE OVER THE WEEKEND...
A tropical disturbance, JTWC Invest 95W, centered near 4N148E is
drifting toward the west. It is expected to turn northwestward,
moving toward Yap over the next few days. Latest model guidance is
in better agreement over the expected movement of this system,
though they differ on timing and intensity. All models continue to
show 95W remaining south of Guam, with the GFS showing heavy showers
streaming across the Marianas over the weekend into Monday. Rainfall
amounts continue to be difficult to predict, with the ECMWF showing
less than 3 inches over Guam and Rota, decreasing northward to less
than 1 inch for Saipan and Tinian. The GFS shows amounts between 5
and 7 inches over Tinian and Saipan with amounts in excess of 10
inches for Guam and Rota. Heavy rainfall remains a possibility
across the region as 95W strengthens and moves northwest, with
amounts of 5 to 7 inches possible with locally heavier amounts.
Localized flooding is possible in low-lying and poor drainage areas,
while flash flooding will be possible in areas of heaviest rainfall,
especially near steep terrain. Residents of the Marianas need to
closely monitor this developing situation as watches, advisories and
warnings could be issued later in the week. If living near streams
and rivers, prepare to move items away from stream and river banks.
Make sure storm drains nearby are not clogged, especially in
low-lying areas.
This outlook will be updated over the next couple of days with
additional information, or cancelled if the situation changes.</description>
