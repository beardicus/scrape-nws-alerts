<headline>High Wind Warning issued April 06 at 1:55PM MDT until April 07 at 6:00PM MDT by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM MDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Northwest winds 30 to 40 mph with gusts up to 70 mph.
* WHERE...The Sturgis/Piedmont Foot Hills.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM MDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...The high winds may blow down large trees and damage
roofs, small outbuildings, and signs. Power outages are
possible. Travel could be difficult, especially for high
profile vehicles. Strong winds can cause blowing dust, reduced
visibility, and flying debris.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Periods of snow will continue through this
evening, with additional accumulations generally less than an
inch. The combination of snowfall and areas of blowing snow may
lead to significantly reduced visibility at times.</description>
<instruction>Persons outdoors should watch for flying or falling objects that
may injure you. If you are driving, be prepared for sudden wind
gusts that can cause you to lose control of your vehicle,
especially on open stretches, or as you approach the crest of
hills. Also be alert for debris or dust blowing across the road.</instruction>
