<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued April 06 at 3:14AM CDT until April 07 at 7:00PM CDT by NWS Brownsville</headline>
<description>...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS EXPECTED THIS AFTERNOON WITH
ELEVATED TO CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS POSSIBLE THURSDAY...
.A cold front this afternoon brings moderate to briefly strong
northerly winds across Deep South Texas this afternoon, with
relative humidity values dropping into the teens along and west of
I69C/US281 and below 30 degrees along the coastal counties of
Kenedy, Willacy, and Cameron. Near record heat is expected across
most of the Rio Grande Valley, with triple digit high
temperatures possible into early afternoon. Relative humidity
values drop another 5 to 10 degrees on Thursday across Deep South
Texas, with breezy winds, mainly along the coast. Due to
worsening drought conditions, critically dry fuels, and recent
wildfire activity, a Fire Weather Watch has also been issued for
Thursday and a Red Flag Warning may be needed. Burning of any kind
should be avoided.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY MORNING THROUGH
THURSDAY EVENING FOR WINDS, VERY DRY FUELS, AND LOW RELATIVE
HUMIDITY FOR PORTIONS OF DEEP SOUTH TEXAS...

* TIMING...10 AM to 7 PM.
* WIND...Northeasterly 15 to 20 mph, with gusts to 25 mph.

<instruction>A fire weather watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are forecast to occur. In general...these conditions include
sustained 20 foot winds of 25 MPH or greater...humidity ranging
from below 25 percent in Zapata County to below 45 percent along
the coast...each lasting for 2 hours or more...and cured fuels.
Humidity below 25 percent in most areas will trigger fire danger
at lower wind speeds. Detailed decision tables are found at
https://weather.gov/rgv/mapcolors#fire. Listen for later
forecasts and possible Red Flag Warnings.</instruction>
