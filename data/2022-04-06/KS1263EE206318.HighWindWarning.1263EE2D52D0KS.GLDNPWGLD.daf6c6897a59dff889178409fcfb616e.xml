problems...decrease lung activity...aggravate asthma...and lead
to potential heart-related problems...especially with children...

People should avoid being outside in forested areas and around
trees and branches. If possible, remain in the lower levels of
your home during the windstorm, and avoid windows. Use caution if
you must drive.</instruction>
