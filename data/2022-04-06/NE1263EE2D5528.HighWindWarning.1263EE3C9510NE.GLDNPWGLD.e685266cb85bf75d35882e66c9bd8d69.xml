* WHEN...For the High Wind Warning on Thursday, from 11 AM MDT

expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Several reports of near zero visibility
have been received across the warned area. We urge travelers
to get off area roadways as soon as possible due to the zero
visibility dust storm developing.</description>
<instruction>People with respiratory problems should make preparations to stay
indoors until the storm passes. Be ready for a sudden drop in
visibility to near zero. If you encounter blowing dust or blowing
sand on the roadway or see it approaching, pull off the road as
far as possible and put your vehicle in park. Turn the lights all
the way off and keep your foot off the brake pedal. Remember,
Pull Aside, Stay Alive.
A High Wind Warning means strong winds are either occurring or
imminent which could lead to property damage...reduced visibility
in blowing dust...and loss of vehicle control. A High Wind
Warning is issued for sustained wind speeds of at least 40 mph or
gusts of 58 mph or more.</instruction>
