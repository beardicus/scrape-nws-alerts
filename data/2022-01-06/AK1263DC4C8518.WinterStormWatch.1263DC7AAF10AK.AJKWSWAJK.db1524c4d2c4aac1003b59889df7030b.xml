<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 06 at 9:46PM AKST until January 10 at 12:00AM AKST by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...WIND CHILL ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON AKST FRIDAY...
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY EVENING
THROUGH SUNDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Wind Chill Advisory, very cold wind chills.
Wind chills as low as 30 to 40 below zero. For the Winter
Storm Watch, heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of
7 to 20 inches or higher possible. Winds could gust as high as
40 mph.
* WHERE...Upper Lynn Canal including Haines, Skagway, the Haines
Highway, and the South Klondike Highway.
* WHEN...For the Wind Chill Advisory, until noon AKST Friday.
For the Winter Storm Watch, from Saturday evening through
Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible.
Slippery conditions will develop. The dangerously cold wind
chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as
10 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Amounts are uncertain at this time, but
could be higher than the 7 to 20 inches forecasted due to faster
arrival of snow or longer duration of the cold air. Wet and
heavy snow could challenge rooftops, decks, and boats with
extremely heavy loads. Pay close attention to your local
avalanche forecast especially for those near steep terrain. With
possible rain over a deep snowpack next week, flooding is also
an increasing concern.</description>
