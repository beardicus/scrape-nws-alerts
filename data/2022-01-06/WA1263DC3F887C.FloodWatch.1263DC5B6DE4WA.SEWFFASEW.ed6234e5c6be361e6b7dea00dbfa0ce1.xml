<headline>Flood Watch issued January 06 at 1:35PM PST until January 07 at 8:17PM PST by NWS Seattle</headline>
<description>.Heavy rain may fall on a deep primed snowpack leading to the melt
increasing. Flows in rivers may increase quickly and reach critical
levels.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of northwest Washington and west central
Washington, including the following counties, Grays Harbor, Mason,
King, Lewis, Pierce, Snohomish and Thurston.
* WHEN...Through Saturday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A period of heavy precipitation through Friday will result in
total
accumulations of water equivalent in the watch area of 3 to 6
inches for the Olympics, 4 to 9 inches for the Cascades, and
2 to 4 inches in the lowlands of the watch area, with locally
higher amounts. The snow level has risen, resulting in a good
portion of the precipitation falling as rain. Lowland snow
over much of the area will also melt, contributing to
saturated soil and storm runoff. The
uncertainty with the rising snow level and the amount of
lowland snowmelt makes the flood potential quite uncertain as
to how much flooding there will be.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
