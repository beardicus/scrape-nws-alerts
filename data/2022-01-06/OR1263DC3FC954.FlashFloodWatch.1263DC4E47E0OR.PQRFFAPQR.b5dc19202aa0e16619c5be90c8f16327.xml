The Flood Watch has been replaced with a Flash Flood Watch in the
western Columbia River Gorge on the Oregon side of the river for
flash flooding and debris flow potential in the Eagle Creek burn
area.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor forecasts and be prepared to take action should
Flash Flood Warnings be issued. Be prepared to evacuate on short
notice.
Local emergency services are monitoring the situation and will issue
a public statement as conditions warrant. PLAN NOW so you will know
what to do in an emergency. Keep informed by listening to local
radio and television for statements and possible warnings. Follow
the advice of public safety officials.
There have been several confirmed debris flows within the Eagle
Creek Burn Area over the past 24 hours. Large destructive debris
flows and mudflows are likely with additional rain later tonight
into early Friday morning. Debris flows are likely along streams, in
canyons and below mouths of canyons in the warned area. Debris flows
could overflow normal channels, crossing roads and impacting
structures near or below burned drainages and hillsides. If you are
in a low lying area around a stream or creek channel, or you hear
rumbling sounds, move to higher ground immediately. Do not drive
across a flooded area or into shallow debris even though it may look
passable.</instruction>
