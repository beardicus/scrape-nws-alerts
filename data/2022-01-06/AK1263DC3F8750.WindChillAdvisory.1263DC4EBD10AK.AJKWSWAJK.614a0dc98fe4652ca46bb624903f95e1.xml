<headline>Wind Chill Advisory issued January 06 at 12:32PM AKST until January 07 at 12:00PM AKST by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...WIND CHILL ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON AKST FRIDAY...
...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY EVENING THROUGH
SUNDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Wind Chill Advisory, very cold wind chills. Wind
chills as low as 30 to 40 below zero. For the Winter Storm
Watch, heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 7 to 20
inches or higher possible. Winds could gust as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Upper Lynn Canal including Haines, Skagway, the Haines
Highway, and the South Klondike Highway.
* WHEN...For the Wind Chill Advisory, until noon AKST Friday.
For the Winter Storm Watch, from Saturday evening through
Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Slippery
conditions will develop. The dangerously cold wind chills could
cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Amounts are uncertain at this time, but
could be higher than the 7 to 20 inches forecasted due to faster
arrival of snow or longer duration of the cold air. Wet and
heavy snow could challenge roof-tops, decks, and boats with
extremely heavy loads. Pay close attention to your local
avalanche forecast especially for those near steep terrain. With
possible rain over a deep snowpack next week, flooding is also
an increasing concern.</description>
