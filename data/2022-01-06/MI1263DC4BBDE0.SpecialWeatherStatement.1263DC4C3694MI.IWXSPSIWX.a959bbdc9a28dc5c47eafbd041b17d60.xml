<description>...INCOMING MODERATE TO HEAVY LAKE EFFECT SNOW BAND...
A band of moderate to heavy lake effect snow located along a line
from roughly Covert, Michigan to near Paw Paw, MI as of 8:30 pm
EST will shift southward through the next few hours and likely
stall somewhere within Berrien and Cass Counties in Michigan.
This includes Interstate 94, US 12, and US 31.
Visibilities within this band have been less than 1/2 mile at
times thanks to intense snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour
and blowing and drifting snow. Expect roads to quickly become
snow covered and slippery. Accidents have already been reported.
If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency. Drive slow on ice and snow.</description>
