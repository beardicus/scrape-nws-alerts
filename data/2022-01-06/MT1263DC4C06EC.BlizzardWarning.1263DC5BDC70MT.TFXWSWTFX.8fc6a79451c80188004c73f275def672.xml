MIDNIGHT MST FRIDAY NIGHT...

to 3 inches on the plains and to 16 inches at higher elevations.
Winds gusting as high as 60 mph.
* WHERE...The Rocky Mountain Front.
* WHEN...From Midnight tonight to Midnight MST Friday Night.
* IMPACTS...Visibilities may drop below 1/4 mile due to falling and

is absolutely necessary, drive with extreme caution. Consider taking

would help you survive in case you become stranded.</instruction>
