<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 06 at 3:18PM EST until January 07 at 10:00AM EST by NWS Grand Rapids</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM EST
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow. Additional snow accumulations of 6 to 12
inches with locally over one foot possible.
* WHERE...Portions of southwest and west central Michigan.
* WHEN...Until 10 AM EST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult and roads may become
impassible at times. The hazardous conditions will impact
commutes today into Friday morning.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A dominant band of heavy lake effect snow
currently mostly off shore from Manistee to Whitehall and comes
on shore just north of Holland a 3 pm. This band will become
more north to south oriented after dark. This will result in
many hours of steady heavy snow where this band comes on shore.
Locations near and south of South Haven, near US-31 have the
greatest risk of getting 1 to 2 feet of snow by Friday morning.
Just inland of that there could be a more widespread 3 to 6
inches into the central parts of both counties. Extreme western
Kalamazoo County could see the eastern edge of that snow band.
Over Ottawa County, all of the county will see heavy snow early
this evening but only the lake shore , near US-31 will see
significant snow overnight. This will significantly impact the
commute Friday morning in those areas.</description>
