<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY
EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM SUNDAY TO 10 PM PST
MONDAY...
* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, minor beach erosion and
minor tidal overflow. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking
waves of 4 to 7 feet with dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Ventura County Beaches.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, through Sunday
evening. For the High Surf Advisory, from 10 AM Sunday to 10 PM
PST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Pooling of sea water is possible around high tide at
beach and harbor areas that is uncommon with normal tidal
ranges. Minor beach erosion is also possible. No significant
damage is expected. There is an increased risk for ocean
drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea.
Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches
and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The time of greatest concern will be
during morning high tide which will range between 7.0 and 7.3
feet between 730 AM and 900 AM this weekend.</description>
