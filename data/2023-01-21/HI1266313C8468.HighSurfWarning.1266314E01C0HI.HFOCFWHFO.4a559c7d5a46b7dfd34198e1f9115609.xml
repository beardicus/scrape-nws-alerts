NIIHAU KAUAI OAHU MOLOKAI AND FOR THE NORTH FACING SHORES OF
MAUI...
...HIGH SURF WARNING IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH EARLY

...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH EARLY
MONDAY MORNING FOR WEST FACING SHORES OF LANAI...
.An extra large northwest (300-320 degree) swell will rapidly
build late tonight through Sunday and will produce extremely
dangerous surf. Waves could overtop lower roadways especially
during the early morning high tides along north and west facing
shorelines.
...HIGH SURF WARNING IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT TONIGHT TO 6 AM HST
MONDAY...
* WHAT...Dangerously large breaking waves of 20 to 30 feet along
west facing shore of Kauai.
* WHERE...Kauai Southwest.
* WHEN...From midnight tonight to 6 AM HST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Very High. Expect ocean water surging and sweeping
across beaches, periodically overtopping vulnerable coastal
roadways with localized beach erosion. Wave runup could impact
coastal properties and infrastructure, especially around high
tides early Sunday morning. Powerful longshore and rip currents
will be present. Surges and strong currents inside exposed
harbors could cause damage to boats due to the jostling of boats
and floating docks.</description>
<instruction>Stay away from the shoreline along the affected coasts. Be
prepared for road closures. Postpone entering or leaving channels
affected by the high surf until the surf subsides.</instruction>
