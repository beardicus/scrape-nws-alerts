<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued January 21 at 2:44PM PST until January 23 at 3:00PM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>...LONG PERIOD SWELL, SNEAKER WAVES, AND KING TIDES WILL RESULT
IN HAZARDOUS BEACH CONDITIONS. ADDITIONAL RUNUP ON BEACHES
POSSIBLE THIS WEEKEND IN ADDITION TO MINOR COASTAL FLOODING FOR
LOW LYING AREAS THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...
.The highest astronomical tides of the year, commonly referred to
as the King Tides, will impact the coast and San Francisco Bay
shoreline through Monday the 23rd, and have historically resulted
in the localized flooding of specific low lying areas each year.
The lowest low tides of the event will be observed during the
late afternoon to early evening hours which may lead to trouble
for mariners navigating shallow waterways. In addition, long
period northwest swell will enhance sneaker wave and rip current
risk.
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 PM PST
MONDAY...
* WHAT...Minor coastal flooding expected at prone low lying
coastal locations along the coast and the San Francisco Bay
shoreline during peak high tide each day through Monday
afternoon.
* WHERE...North Bay Interior Valleys and San Francisco Bay
Shoreline.
* WHEN...Until 3 PM PST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of areas previously impacted by King Tide
events is expected, including low lying lots, parks, and roads
along the coast and around the San Francisco Bay Shoreline
with the highest high tides. Difficulty navigating shallow bay
waters during the lowest low tides.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Tide poolers and beachgoers should be
familiar with the times and heights of local tidal levels to
avoid hazards that may arise from rapidly shifting water levels.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
