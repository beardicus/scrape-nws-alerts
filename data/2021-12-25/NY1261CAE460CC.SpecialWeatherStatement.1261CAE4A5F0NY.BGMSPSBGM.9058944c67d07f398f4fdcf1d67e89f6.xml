<description>...A FEW POCKETS OF FREEZING RAIN PERSISTING IN NORTHERN ONONDAGA
COUNTY...
Temperatures have mostly risen above freezing in northern Onondaga
County, including the city of Syracuse, but a few pockets at or
below freezing persist, mainly in lower-lying areas on the
outskirts of the city. This includes Camillus, Cicero, and areas
east of I-480 around Green Lakes and Minoa.
Temperatures are likely to climb another degree or two through 6
AM, and while major routes are likely treated, a few side roads
could have icy spots early this morning.
Slow down and be cautious especially on bridges if you are headed
out early this morning.
If traveling east, keep in mind worse conditions exist in
northern Madison and much of Oneida County, where a Winter Weather
Advisory remains in effect.
The latest road conditions can be found on 511ny.org or by dialing
511.</description>
