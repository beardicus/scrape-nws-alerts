<description>...ACCUMULATING SNOW AND MUCH COLDER TEMPERATURES EXPECTED THIS
HOLIDAY WEEKEND...
.A much colder airmass will move southward from interior Canada
this weekend which, when combined with widespread showery
precipitation streaming off the Pacific Ocean, will bring
accumulating snow to all of western Oregon and southwest
Washington. This will include elevations all the way to the
valley floors and to sea level on the coast, beginning on
Christmas and extending into next week. Accumulating snow is
expected to start in the northern portions of the forecast area
on Christmas night, and then spread southward through Sunday
before precipitation decreases in coverage and intensity on
Monday.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM PST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow and blowing snow with near blizzard
conditions. Snow accumulations of 20 to 30 inches. Winds
gusting as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...South Washington Cascades.
* WHEN...Until 4 AM PST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Expect severe winter driving conditions with snow
and ice covered roads, and reduced visibility. Travel could be
very difficult.</description>
<instruction>Anyone with travel plans should stay aware of the latest weather
information, have alternative travel plans, or delay travel if
possible.
If you must travel, be prepared for winter driving conditions
with snow and ice covered roads. If you must travel, slow down,
and allow plenty of extra time to reach your destination. Allow
extra following distance to the vehicle in front of you, and keep
snow chains and a winter survival kit, including a flashlight,
food, and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency.
