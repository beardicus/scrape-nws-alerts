<description>...Multiple Winter Storms to Impact Mountain and Foothill Travel
through Early Next Week...
.A series of winter storms will bring multiple rounds of mountain
snow and gusty winds through early next week. Moderate to heavy
snow will continue this evening. Snow levels will generally be
2000 to 3500 feet but will be lowering tonight to 1000 to 2000
feet, locally lower. Activity will become more showery tonight
with another round of heavy snow late Sunday afternoon and Monday,
with some possible light snow accumulation down into the lower
foothills (1000 feet) Monday evening into early Tuesday morning.
Major travel delays and difficult travel conditions are
anticipated through early next week. Gusty winds will further
reduce visibilities during this event with local whiteout
conditions possible. Holiday travelers should prepare for winter
driving conditions by packing chains, warm winter clothes, and
extra food and water. Foothill locations that do not normally
receive snow should prepare for wintry conditions, especially
from Sunday morning through early Tuesday morning.
