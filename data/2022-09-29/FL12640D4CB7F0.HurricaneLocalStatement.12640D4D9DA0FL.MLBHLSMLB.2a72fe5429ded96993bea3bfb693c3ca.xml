- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Coastal Indian River,
Coastal Martin, Coastal Saint Lucie, Coastal Volusia, Inland
Indian River, Inland Martin, Inland Northern Brevard, Inland

- Storm Intensity 70 mph

SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
At 1100 AM, Ian remains a Tropical Storm, centered about 20 miles
northeast of Cape Canaveral, or about 60 miles east of Orlando, and
moving NE at 9 mph. Ian`s maximum sustained winds have increased
slightly to 70 mph, with higher gusts. Ian will strengthen to a
hurricane again as it tracks northward toward the Carolinas, away from
east central Florida.
A Tropical Storm Warning remains in effect for all counties in east
central Florida and the adjacent Atlantic waters.
Sustained winds at or near Tropical Storm Force will continue this
afternoon, gusting above tropical storm force, and possibly near
hurricane force in squalls to the north and west of the center.
A Flood Watch continues from Osceola and Brevard Counties northward
through late tonight.
Heavy rainfall will continue from Osceola and Brevard Counties
northward, as Ian begins to reemerge over the Atlantic waters.
Additional rainfall amounts of 1-3 inches are possible with locally
higher amounts up to 4 inches, especially in coastal Volusia county.
After extensive flooding across northern portions of east central
Florida this morning, any additional rainfall will exacerbate current
flooding conditions.
A tornado or two remains possible over Volusia and northern Brevard
counties, with the threat continuing to decrease this afternoon as the
center of Ian moves well offshore into the Atlantic.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are ongoing from northern
Osceola and Brevard counties northward. Remain well guarded against
life-threatening flood waters having additional devastating impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- Extreme rainfall flooding may prompt numerous evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may overwhelmingly overflow their banks
in many places with deep moving water. Small streams, creeks,
canals, and ditches may become raging rivers. In mountain
areas, deadly runoff may rage down valleys while increasing
susceptibility to rockslides and mudslides. Flood control
systems and barriers may become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter numerous structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Numerous places where flood waters may cover escape
routes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of raging water
with underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become very
dangerous. Numerous road and bridge closures with some weakened
or washed out.
Elsewhere across East Central Florida, little to no impact is
anticipated.
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are ongoing across east
central Florida. Remain well sheltered from dangerous wind having
additional significant impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
* TORNADOES:
Potential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across Volusia
and northern Brevard counties. Remain well braced against a tornado
event having possible limited impacts. If realized, these impacts
include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
Elsewhere across East Central Florida, little to no impact is
anticipated.
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding north of
Sebastian Inlet. Remain well away from locally hazardous surge having
possible limited impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread
with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where
surge water covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Do not enter evacuated areas until officials have given the all clear
to return.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to stay inside and away from windows. Listen for
updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Keep a battery-
powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.
During the peak of the storm be ready to move quickly. Keep your
shoes on and rain gear handy. Boots and athletic shoes offer the best
foot protection if you become unexpectedly exposed to the weather.
Keep your cell phone charged and in power-saving mode. If you lose
power, use it sparingly and mainly for personal emergencies and
check-ins.
It is important to remain calm, informed, and focused during an
emergency. Be patient and helpful with those you encounter.
If you are a visitor, be sure to know the name of the city or town in
which you are staying and the name of the county or parish in which
it resides. Listen for these locations in local news updates. Pay
attention for instructions from local authorities.
Rapidly rising flood waters are deadly. If you are in a flood-prone
area, consider moving to higher ground. Never drive through a flooded
roadway. Remember, turn around don`t drown!
If a Tornado Warning is issued for your area, be ready to shelter
quickly, preferably away from windows and in an interior room not
prone to flooding. If driving, scan the roadside for quick shelter
options.
If in a place that is vulnerable to high wind, such as near large
trees, a manufactured home, upper floors of a high-rise building, or
on a boat, consider moving to a safer shelter before the onset of
strong winds or flooding.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
