SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Ian will move off the east coast of Florida this
morning and slowly drift up towards the southeast coast later today
into Friday. Hazardous conditions extend well away from the center of
the system. The following hazardous conditions can be expected for
South Florida:
* Peak storm surge values of 4 to 6 feet are expected particularly in
surge prone areas between Bonita Beach to Chokoloskee. Peak storm
surge values of 2 to 4 feet are the main concern from Chokoloskee to
East Cape Sable. The storm surge will be slow to subside and may
impact the region through late week. This could lead to significant
and life-threatening storm surge flooding particularly along coastal
Collier County.
* Some residual sheet flow flooding will be possible this morning
across portions of Collier, Glades and Hendry counties.
* Hazardous marine, beach, and surf conditions are ongoing.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
the northern half of South Florida. Remain well sheltered from dangerous
wind having possible significant impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
Potential impacts from the main wind event are also now unfolding
across the southern half of South Florida. Remain well sheltered from
hazardous wind having possible limited impacts.
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across
southwest Florida. Remain well away from life-threatening
surge having additional significant impacts. If realized, these impacts
include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
Potential impacts from the main surge event are also now unfolding
across the Florida bay coast. Remain well away from locally
hazardous surge having possible limited impacts.
Elsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact is anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
portions of Collier, Hendry, and Glades counties. Remain well guarded
against locally hazardous flood waters having possible limited
impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.
- Ditches and canals may quickly rise with swift currents.
- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually
vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding of water
occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become
near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge
closures.
Elsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact is anticipated.
* TORNADOES:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time
across South Florida.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Do not enter evacuated areas until officials have given the all clear
to return.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
If you are prone to flooding or in an area under a storm surge watch
or warning, be prepared for the possibility of a quick and dramatic
rise in water levels.
* ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION:
