SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Ian continues as a hurricane over the western Atlantic, and was moving towards
the Carolinas. Ian is expected to intensify as it treks through the Atlantic
waters towards the Carolinas tonight and Friday morning.
A storm surge warning for dangerous storm surge inundation along the coast,
Intracoastal Waterway, as well as the St Johns River. Trapped tides in the
St. Johns river will exacerbate flooding for areas along the St. Johns
river for several days.
Tropical storm warnings remain up for portions of northeast FL and
southeast GA. Over the tropical storm warning area, tropical storm
force winds are continuing but will diminish later tonight.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are unfolding
across coastal southeast Georgia, coastal northeast Florida,
Intracoastal waterway, and the St. Johns River basin. Remain well
away from life- threatening surge having possible significant
impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
Also, protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across inland Glynn, Nassau, and Camden counties.
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are unfolding across
eastern parts of northeast Florida and southeast Georgia. Remain
well sheltered from dangerous wind having possible additional significant
impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
* OTHER COASTAL HAZARDS:
Potentially damaging and extremely high surf and severe beach erosion
is expected to continue into Friday. Beachgoers and surfers should
heed all advice given by ocean safety officials. Stay tuned for
additional advisories and warnings on hazardous beach conditions.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Do not enter evacuated areas until officials have given the all clear
to return.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Always heed the advice of local officials and comply with orders that
are issued. Do not needlessly jeopardize your life or the lives of
others.
Do not be a thrill seeker or risk your life for senseless photos or
videos. Do not venture out near flooded roads or approach downed power
lines. Trees will fall over more easily where root systems have been
weakened due to widespread heavy rain.
Be alert for flooded roads which could be compromised or littered
with debris. Avoid travel until water levels subside and roads have
been cleared. Do not drive through places where flood waters cover
the road. Turn around, don`t drown!
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes
to the forecast.
