...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM FRIDAY TO
6 AM EDT SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, one to two feet of
inundation above ground level expected in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways. For the High Surf Advisory,
large breaking waves of 7 to 12 feet expected in the surf
zone. There is also a high risk of rip currents.

Virginia, Virginia Beach.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, from 9 AM Friday to 6 AM
EDT Saturday. For the High Surf Advisory, until 6 AM EDT
Saturday. For the Beach Hazards Statement, through Saturday
evening.
* IMPACTS... Widespread flooding of vulnerable areas will result
in an elevated threat of property damage to homes and
businesses near the waterfront and shoreline. Water will be 1
to 2 feet above ground level in some areas resulting in a
sufficient depth to close numerous roads and threaten homes
and businesses. Flooding will extend inland from the
waterfront along tidal rivers and bays resulting in some road
closures and flooding of vehicles. Dangerous swimming and
surfing conditions and some dune and beach erosion can also be
expected.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
