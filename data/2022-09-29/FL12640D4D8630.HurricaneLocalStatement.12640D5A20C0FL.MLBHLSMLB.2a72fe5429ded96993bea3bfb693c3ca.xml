<description>This product covers East Central Florida
**Ian Has Restrengthened To a Hurricane And Will Continue to Move
Farther Offshore Into Tonight**
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Coastal Indian River,
Coastal Volusia, Inland Indian River, Inland Northern Brevard,
Inland Southern Brevard, Inland Volusia, Mainland Northern
Brevard, Mainland Southern Brevard, Northern Brevard Barrier
Islands, Northern Lake, Orange, Osceola, Seminole, Southern
Brevard Barrier Islands, and Southern Lake
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 70 miles east of Daytona Beach FL or about 80 miles
northeast of Cape Canaveral FL
- 29.3N 79.9W
- Storm Intensity 75 mph
- Movement North-northeast or 30 degrees at 10 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
As of 5 PM, Ian has restrengthened into a hurricane and was
centered about 70 miles northeast of Cape Canaveral moving
north-northeast at 10 mph. Ian`s maximum sustained winds are 75 mph,
with higher gusts. Ian will remain a hurricane as it tracks northward
toward the Carolinas, away from east central Florida.
A Tropical Storm Warning remains in effect for Lake, Volusia,
Seminole, Orange, Osceola, Brevard and Indian River counties. A
Hurricane Warning remains in effect for the coastal waters adjacent to
the Brevard and Volusia coasts for the potential of frequent hurricane
force gusts over the open Atlantic, and a Tropical Storm Warning
remains in effect over the coastal waters of the Treasure Coast.
The threat from Ian still exists! Strong winds on the western
periphery of the storm continue to produce dangerous conditions across
portions of east central Florida, particularly over Brevard and
Volusia counties, where occasional hurricane force wind gusts cannot
be ruled out through this evening.
Additionally, widespread flooding continues as a result of last
night`s rain in association with Ian. Do not attempt to travel through
flooded areas. Stay at home! While the heaviest rainfall has already
occurred, an additional inch cannot be ruled across Volusia and northern
Brevard counties. Any additional rainfall will exacerbate current
flooding conditions.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for dangerous wind having possible significant impacts across
portions of east central Florida, particularly Brevard and Volusia
counties. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
Also, prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts
across the remainder of east central Florida.
* SURGE:
Prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited impacts
across the Volusia and northern Brevard County coastlines. Potential
impacts in this area include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread
with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where
surge water covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
Elsewhere across East Central Florida, little to no impact is
anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
Volusia and northern Brevard counties. Potential impacts include:
- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter currents.
Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may become swollen
and overflow in spots.
- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually
vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding of water
occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become
near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge
closures.
Elsewhere across East Central Florida, little to no impact is
anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Do not enter evacuated areas until officials have given the all clear
to return.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Always heed the advice of local officials and comply with orders that
are issued. Do not needlessly jeopardize your life or the lives of
others.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes
to the forecast.
