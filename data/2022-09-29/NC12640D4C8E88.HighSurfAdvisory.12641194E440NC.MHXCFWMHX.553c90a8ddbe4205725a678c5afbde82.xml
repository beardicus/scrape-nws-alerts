<headline>High Surf Advisory issued September 29 at 11:06AM EDT until September 30 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 8 PM THIS EVENING TO
8 PM EDT FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 8
to 12 feet expected in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards
Statement, dangerous rip currents and large breaking waves in
the surf zone.
* WHERE...Hateras Island and Northern Outer Banks beaches.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, from 8 PM this evening to 8
PM EDT Friday. For the Beach Hazards Statement, until 8 PM EDT
this evening.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore
break can throw a swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom
causing neck and back injuries.</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
