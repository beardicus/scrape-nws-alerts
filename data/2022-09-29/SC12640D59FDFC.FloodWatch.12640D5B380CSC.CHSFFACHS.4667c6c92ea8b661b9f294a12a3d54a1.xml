<headline>Flood Watch issued September 29 at 11:11PM EDT  by NWS Charleston</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH FRIDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of southeast Georgia and southeast South
Carolina, including the following areas, in southeast Georgia,
Coastal Bryan, Coastal Chatham, Coastal Liberty, Coastal McIntosh,
Effingham, Inland Bryan, Inland Chatham, Inland Liberty and Inland
McIntosh. In southeast South Carolina, Beaufort, Charleston,
Coastal Colleton, Coastal Jasper, Dorchester, Hampton, Inland
Berkeley, Inland Colleton, Inland Jasper and Tidal Berkeley.
* WHEN...Through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. Storm drains and ditches may
become clogged with debris. Extensive street flooding and flooding
of creeks and rivers are possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rounds of heavy rainfall producing showers and thunderstorms
are expected to impact much of southeast Georgia and
southeast South Carolina. Rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches
are expected, with the highest amounts occurring across
southeast South Carolina and especially the Charleston Tri-
County region. The most intense rainfall is expected to occur
Friday morning through early Friday afternoon. This means
that the heaviest rain will coincide with high tide and storm
surge inundation associated with Ian, exacerbating the flash
flooding threat.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action
should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.
Be prepared to protect life and property, especially in areas prone
to flooding. If flooding develops, move to higher ground
immediately. If driving, be prepared for flooded roadways and
possible road closures.</instruction>
