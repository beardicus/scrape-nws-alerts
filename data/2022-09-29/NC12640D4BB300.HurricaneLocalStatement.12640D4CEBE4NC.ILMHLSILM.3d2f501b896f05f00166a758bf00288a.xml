POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Protect against dangerous wind having possible significant impacts
across portions of South Carolina. Potential impacts in this area
include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding, along with damage to porches
and awnings. A few buildings experiencing window, door, and
garage door failures. Damage to vulnerable structures such as
carports, sheds and mobile homes is possible.
- Large limbs will be down with several trees snapped or
uprooted. Several fences and roadway signs may become blown
over. Some roads may become impassable due to large debris
blocking the roadway, especially within urban or heavily wooded
locations. Some bridges, causeways, and elevated roads may be
impacted by high winds making driving on them hazardous.
- Scattered power and communications outages are possible, but
more prevalent in areas with above ground lines.
- Small craft that are not properly moored may break loose.
Also, protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts
across North Carolina.
* SURGE:
Protect against life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across coastal South Carolina. Potential impacts in this area
include:
- Areas of storm surge inundation enhanced by breaking waves are
possible along the barrier islands. Damage to several buildings
is possible, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore roads may become weakened or washed out,
especially in vulnerable low-lying areas.
- Delivery of drinking water and sewer services may be
interrupted.
- Major beach erosion is possible with heavy surf and elevated
water levels impacting or breaching the dunes.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft will break away from moorings, especially
in unprotected anchorages.
- Navigation may be difficult near inlets and waterways, as
navigational aids may be off station or missing.
Also, protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across coastal North Carolina.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across northeast South Carolina. Potential
impacts include:
- Major flooding from rainfall may prompt evacuations and
numerous rescues.
- Rivers and streams may rapidly overflow their banks in multiple
places. Creeks and ditches will flood and may contain strong
currents.
- Flood waters may enter many structures, and some may become
uninhabitable. Some road scours or complete road failures will
be possible, along with the potential for sinkholes. Many
streets and parking lots may flood, and may be impacted by
flowing water. Many road and low-lying bridge closures are
possible with some weakened or washed away. Driving conditions
will be dangerous.The delivery of drinking water and sewer
services may be interrupted. Flood waters may be polluted and
contain hazardous materials.
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible
significant impacts across northeast South Carolina.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts
across southeast North Carolina and northeast South Carolina.
Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Tornadoes can cause damage to trees, vehicles, boats, and
buildings. Unsecured mobile homes and poorly constructed
structures are particularly vulnerable.
