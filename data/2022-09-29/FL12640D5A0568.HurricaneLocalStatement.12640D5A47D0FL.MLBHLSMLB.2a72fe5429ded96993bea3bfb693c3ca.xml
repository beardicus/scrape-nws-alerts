<description>This product covers East Central Florida
**Even after the Wind and Rain Ends, Leftover Impacts From Hurricane
Ian Will Continue**
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- All watches and warnings have been canceled
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 130 miles northeast of Daytona Beach FL
- 30.2N 79.3W

SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
At 11 PM, Hurricane Ian was centered about 130 miles northeast of
Daytona Beach and moving north-northeast well away from the east
central Florida coast. Ian`s maximum sustained winds were near 80 mph.
Ian will remain a hurricane as it tracks north toward the Carolinas.
The Tropical Storm Warning for Volusia and Brevard Counties has been
discontinued, meaning that Tropical Storm Warnings are no longer in
effect for any land areas of east central Florida.
A Tropical Storm Warning is now in effect for the local Atlantic
waters from Flagler Beach to Jupiter Inlet out to 60 nautical miles.
A Coastal Flood Warning has been issued for Volusia and Brevard
Counties through late Friday evening. Beach erosion and inundation of
vulnerable or weakened areas of the dune line remains possible during
the next three high tide cycles, which will occur through midnight
tonight, noon on Friday, and 1 AM Saturday morning.
There will also be a High Risk of life-threatening rip currents at the
beaches through Friday.
Lingering threats from Ian will continue overnight! Stronger wind
gusts on the far western periphery of Ian could still knock over a few
more trees, especially since the ground is saturated or, in some
areas, inundated from flooding and standing water.
Widespread flooding continues across many areas, and water will be
very slow to subside over the next several days, and possibly longer
in the Saint Johns River Basin, and other large rivers lakes, and
water retention areas.
Do not attempt to travel through flooded areas!! It is very difficult,
if not impossible, to recognize the dangers of flooding at night!! If
you cannot see the road beneath you, it could be washed out!!
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Do not enter evacuated areas until officials have given the all clear
to return.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Do not go sightseeing within impacted communities. Sightseers
interfere with the emergency work of first responders.
When going outside be sure to stay away from downed power lines,
hazardous debris and flooded areas. If your home or shelter was
damaged, be alert to the smell of gas leaks and be cautious around
electrical wiring, broken glass, jagged metal and wood, and protruding
nails and screws.
Check on your neighbors. If necessary, help them connect with their
points of contact. Do not attempt to return to evacuated areas until
local authorities have inspected roads and bridges and have given the
all clear. Hazards like downed power lines and trees, washed out roads,
continued flooding in low lying areas and non-functioning traffic
lights make travel difficult.
Do not go up on your roof until the weather conditions are safe.
Ladders can be slippery in the rain and unexpected wind gusts can blow
you off the roof. When clearing out fallen trees, be careful with
chainsaws and axes. Always wear protective gear and keep others at a
safe distance.
If using a generator, avoid carbon monoxide poisoning by following
instructions provided by the manufacturer. Operate your generator in a
well-ventilated space outside of your living area and away from open
doors and windows.
Be alert for any lingering wind gusts which could take down weakened
trees and/or power lines, collapse damaged structures, or cause
flying debris.
Be alert for additional flooding from rising rivers and streams which
may have yet to crest. Remain informed of the latest river forecasts
and heed any flood watches and warnings.
Be alert for flooded roads which could be compromised or littered
with debris. Avoid travel until water levels subside and roads have
been cleared. Do not drive through places where flood waters cover
the road. Turn around, don`t drown!
