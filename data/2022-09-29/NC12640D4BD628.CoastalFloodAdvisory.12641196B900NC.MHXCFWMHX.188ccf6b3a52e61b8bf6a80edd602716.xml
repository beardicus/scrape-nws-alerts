<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued September 29 at 6:34AM EDT until October 01 at 8:00AM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM EDT
SATURDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 8 PM THIS EVENING TO 8 PM
EDT FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 8 to
12 feet expected in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood
Advisory, 1 to 3 feet of inundation above ground level expected
in low- lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways. For
the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents, large
breaking waves expected, and strong longshore currents in the
surf zone.
* WHERE...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, areas along the lower
Neuse River, Pamlico, Core and Back Sounds, including inlets and
adjacent tidal creeks, plus all oceanside Carteret County
Beaches. For the High Surf Advisory and the Beach Hazards
Statement, beaches along Core Banks.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, from 8 PM this evening to 8
PM EDT Friday. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 8 AM EDT
Saturday. For the Beach Hazards Statement, through this
evening.
* IMPACTS...Up to 1 to 3 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in an elevated threat of property damage. Some roads and low
lying property including parking lots, parks, lawns, and homes
adjacent to the waterfront will experience shallow flooding.
Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach
erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from
shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw a
swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom causing neck and
back injuries. Strong longshore currents will create dangerous
swimming conditions.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
