door, and garage door failures. Damage to vulnerable
structures such as carports, sheds and mobile homes is
possible.
- Large limbs will be down with several trees snapped or
uprooted. Several fences and roadway signs may become blown
over. Some roads may become impassable due to large debris
blocking the roadway, especially within urban or heavily
wooded locations. Some bridges, causeways, and elevated
roads may be impacted by high winds making driving on them
hazardous.

multiple places. Creeks and ditches will flood and may
contain strong currents.

uninhabitable. Some road scours or complete road failures
