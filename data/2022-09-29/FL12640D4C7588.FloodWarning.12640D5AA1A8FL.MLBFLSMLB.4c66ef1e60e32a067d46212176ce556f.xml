<headline>Flood Warning issued September 29 at 10:42AM EDT until further notice by NWS Melbourne</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in Florida...
St Johns River Near Astor affecting Lake and Volusia Counties.
.The center of Tropical Storm Ian will emerge off of the Brevard
County coast in the next hour, with historic rainfall of 12 to 18
inches reported across east central Florida. These amounts have
already caused quick rises along the Saint Johns River. The forecast
point at Astor is currently in Moderate Flood Stage and will reach
Major Flood Stage within the next several hours. The river is
forecast to crest near the Flood of Record at 4.6 feet later
tonight, then decreasing toward Moderate Stage into the weekend, as
north to northeast winds cause a backup at the point. Interests
along the river should be prepared for major flood impacts to arrive
today and tonight.
For the St. Johns River...including Astor...Major flooding is
forecast.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
The next statement will be issued late tonight at 330 AM EDT.
