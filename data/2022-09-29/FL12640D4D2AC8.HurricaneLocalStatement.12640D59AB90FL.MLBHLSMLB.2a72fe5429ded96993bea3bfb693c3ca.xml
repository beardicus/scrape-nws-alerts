<description>This product covers East Central Florida
**IAN CONTINUES TO PRODUCE DANGEROUS CONDITIONS ACROSS PORTIONS OF EAST
CENTRAL FLORIDA, PARTICULARLY OVER BREVARD AND VOLUSIA COUNTIES***
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- The Tropical Storm Warning has been cancelled for Coastal
Martin, Coastal Saint Lucie, Inland Martin, Inland Saint Lucie,
and Okeechobee
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Coastal Indian River,
Coastal Volusia, Inland Indian River, Inland Northern Brevard,
Inland Southern Brevard, Inland Volusia, Mainland Northern
Brevard, Mainland Southern Brevard, Northern Brevard Barrier
Islands, Northern Lake, Orange, Osceola, Seminole, Southern
Brevard Barrier Islands, and Southern Lake
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 50 miles northeast of Cape Canaveral FL
- 28.9N 80.0W
- Storm Intensity 70 mph
- Movement North-northeast or 30 degrees at 9 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
As of 2 PM, Tropical Storm Ian was centered about 40 miles northeast
of Cape Canaveral moving NE at 9 mph. Ian`s maximum sustained winds
remain 70 mph, with higher gusts. Ian is forecast to restrengthen to a
hurricane again as it tracks northward toward the Carolinas, away from
east central Florida.
The Tropical Storm Warning has been cancelled for Martin, Saint Lucie,
and Okeechobee. A Tropical Storm Warning remains in effect for the
rest of east central Florida. A Hurricane Warning has been issued for
the coastal waters adjacent to the Brevard and Volusia coasts for the
potential of frequent hurricane force gusts over the open Atlantic.
The threat from Ian still exists! Strong winds on the western
periphery of the storm continue to produce dangerous conditions across
portions of east central Florida, particularly over Brevard and
Volusia counties, where hurricane force wind gusts cannot be ruled out
for the next several hours.
Additionally, widespread flooding continues as a result of last
night`s rain in association with Ian. Do not attempt to travel through
flooded areas. Stay at home! While the heaviest rainfall has already
occurred, an additional 1 to 2 inches cannot be ruled across Volusia
and northern Brevard counties. Any additional rainfall will exacerbate
current flooding conditions.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for dangerous wind having possible significant impacts across
portions of east central Florida, particularly Brevard and Volusia
counties. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
Also, prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts
across the remainder of east central Florida.
* SURGE:
Prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited impacts
across the Volusia and northern Brevard County coastlines. Potential
impacts in this area include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread
with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where
surge water covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
Elsewhere across East Central Florida, little to no impact is
anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant
impacts across coastal Volusia and northern Brevard counties.
Potential impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals, and
ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid inundation
at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage areas. Some
streets and parking lots take on moving water as storm drains and
retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions become hazardous.
Some road and bridge closures.
Elsewhere across East Central Florida, little to no impact is
anticipated.
* TORNADOES:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time across East Central
Florida.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Do not enter evacuated areas until officials have given the all clear
to return.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Always heed the advice of local officials and comply with orders that
are issued. Do not needlessly jeopardize your life or the lives of
others.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes
to the forecast.
