<headline>Flood Warning issued September 29 at 4:20AM EDT until further notice by NWS Melbourne</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Melbourne FL has issued a Flood
Warning for the following rivers in Florida...
St Johns River Near Deland affecting Lake and Volusia Counties.
.As Hurricane Ian moves toward the east central Florida coast early
this morning, historic heavy rainfall will continue, leading to
quickly rising levels on the Saint Johns River at Deland. Levels
will rise to Minor Flood Stage by this afternoon and continue to
climb, reaching Major Flood Stage this weekend, cresting at 5.8
which is just below Record Flood. Interests along the river should
be prepared for major flood impacts in the next 24 hours. Due to
wind effects and drainage from upstream, the river is forecast to
remain in Major Flood into early next week.
For the St. Johns River...including Deland...Major flooding is
forecast.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
The next statement will be issued this afternoon at 430 PM EDT.
