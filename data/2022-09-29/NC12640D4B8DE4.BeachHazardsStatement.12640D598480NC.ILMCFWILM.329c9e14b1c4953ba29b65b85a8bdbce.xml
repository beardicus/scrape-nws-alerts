moderate coastal flooding and become impassable. Low-lying
roads and locations along the Intracoastal Waterway and
adjacent tidal creeks will observe moderate coastal flooding.
Roadways and structures adjacent to ocean swashes may be

swimmers and surfers into rip currents, piers, jetties, and
other hazardous areas. It may sweep swimmers off their feet,

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.
Caution should be used when in or near the water. Check with
lifeguards before entering the ocean for possible hazards you may
be swept into.</instruction>
