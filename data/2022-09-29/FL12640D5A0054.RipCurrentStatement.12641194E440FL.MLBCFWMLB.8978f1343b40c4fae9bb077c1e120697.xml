<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 AM EDT SATURDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK IN EFFECT THROUGH FRIDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, significant coastal
flooding. For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip
currents.
* WHERE...Coastal Volusia, Mainland Northern Brevard, Northern
Brevard Barrier Islands, Mainland Southern Brevard and
Southern Brevard Barrier Islands Counties.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, until 2 AM EDT Saturday.
For the High Rip Current Risk, through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...Coastal roads may be closed. Significant shoreline
erosion will occur. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>Coastal flooding is occurring or imminent. Coastal residents in
the warned area should be alert for rising water, and take
appropriate action to protect life and property. If travel is
required, do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as jetties and
piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
