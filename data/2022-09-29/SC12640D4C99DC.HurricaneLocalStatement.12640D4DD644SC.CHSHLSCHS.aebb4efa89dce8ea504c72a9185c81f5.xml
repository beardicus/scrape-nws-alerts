SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Ian is expected to move slowly offshore of the
Florida east coast this afternoon. Ian is expected to approach north
coastal Georgia and south coastal South Carolina as a hurricane,
making landfall on Friday. The risk for impacts will increase
beginning this afternoon and continue into Friday night with life-
threatening storm surge inundation, flooding rains, isolated tornadoes
and tropical storm force winds as the storm approaches the
area. Wind gusts to hurricane force are also possible, mainly along
the immediate coast and around Charleston Harbor. The combination of
life-threatening storm surge inundation and heavy rainfall could
produce areas of considerable urban and flash flooding, especially
Friday. In addition, dangerous marine and surf conditions will
continue with significant beach and lakeshore erosion becoming more
likely at the beaches and around Lake Moultrie.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Protect against life-threatening surge having possible extensive
impacts near and around tidal areas of Charleston County South Carolina.
Potential impacts in this area include:
- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate
shorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near rivers
and creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by battering
waves. Structural damage to buildings, with several washing
away. Damage compounded by floating debris. Locations may be
uninhabitable for an extended period.
- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads
washed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control systems and
barriers could become stressed.
- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.
- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many
small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and stranded.
- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.
- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in surge
waters.
Elsewhere near and around tidal areas of southeast South Carolina and
southeast Georgia, possible significant impacts anticipated.
* WIND:
Protect against life-threatening wind having possible extensive
impacts across Charleston and coastal Colleton County. Potential
impacts in this area include:
- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some window,
door, and garage door failures leading to structural damage.
Mobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed. Damage
accentuated by airborne projectiles. Some locations may be
uninhabitable for weeks.
- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne
projectiles outside.
- Large trees snapped or uprooted.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and access routes
impassable.
- Large areas with power and communications outages, which could
persist for days.
- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.
Also, protect against dangerous wind having possible limited to
significant impacts across the rest of southeast South Carolina and
southeast Georgia.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across southeast South Carolina and southeast
Georgia. Potential impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding could prompt many rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries could rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple locations. Small streams, creeks, canals, ditches may
become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and barriers
could become stressed.
- Flood waters could enter many structures within multiple
communities; some structures become uninhabitable or are washed
away. Flood waters could cover multiple escape routes. Streets
and parking lots become rivers of moving water with underpasses
submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous. Many road and
bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
- Drinking water and sewer services could be negatively impacted.
- Hazardous containers and materials could possibly be present in
flood waters.
* OTHER COASTAL HAZARDS:
Life-threatening surf conditions, including dangerous rip currents, high
waves, as well as beach and lakeshore erosion are expected across coastal
portions of Southeast South Carolina and Southeast Georgia, including
Lake Moultrie.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts
across the Charleston Tri-County area. Potential impacts include:
- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency plans.
- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along with
power and communications disruptions.
- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees, vehicles,
boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and other poorly
constructed structures.
Elsewhere across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia,
little to no impact is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions, including
possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so immediately.
For those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind, falling
trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move, relocate to
a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help keep roadways open
for those under evacuation orders.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
near the ocean or a large inland lake, in a low-lying or poor
drainage area, in a valley, or near an already swollen river, plan to
move to safe shelter on higher ground.
Storm surge is the leading killer associated with tropical storms and
hurricanes! Make sure you are in a safe area away from the surge
zone. Even if you are not in a surge-prone area, you could find
yourself cutoff by flood waters during and after the storm. Heed
evacuation orders issued by the local authorities.
Rapidly rising flood waters are deadly. If you are in a flood-prone
area, consider moving to higher ground. Never drive through a flooded
roadway. Remember, turn around don`t drown!
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
