...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM THIS
AFTERNOON TO 8 PM EDT FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, 1 to 3 feet of inundation

and tidal waterways.. For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous
rip currents, large breaking waves expected, and strong longshore
currents in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Coastal Onslow County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 2 PM this
afternoon to 8 PM EDT Friday. For the Beach Hazards Statement,
through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Up to 1 to 3 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in areas near shorelines and tidal waterways resulting
in an elevated threat of property damage. Flooding will extend
inland from the waterfront threatening some homes and businesses.
Road closures and flooding of vehicles will be possible. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw a swimmer or surfer
head first into the bottom causing neck and back injuries. Strong
longshore currents will create dangerous swimming conditions.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Swimmers should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions.</instruction>
