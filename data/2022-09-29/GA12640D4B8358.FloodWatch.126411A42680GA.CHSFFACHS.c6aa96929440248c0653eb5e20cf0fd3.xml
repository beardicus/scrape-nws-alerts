South Carolina. Rounds of showers and thunderstorms
associated with the arrival of Tropical Cyclone Ian could
result in rainfall totals up to 4 to 8 inches across coastal
areas Thursday evening into Saturday morning. Moderate to
heavy rainfall rates during high tide cycles could also
exacerbate flooding at coastal locations, especially on
Friday.

Be prepared to protect life and property, especially in areas prone
to flooding. If flooding develops, move to higher ground
immediately. If driving, be prepared for flooded roadways and
