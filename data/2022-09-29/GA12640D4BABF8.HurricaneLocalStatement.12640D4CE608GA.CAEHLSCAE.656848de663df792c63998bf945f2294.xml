SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Ian will move off the eastern coast of Florida later
this morning. Once over the western Atlantic, it is expected to take a
turn toward the north and eventually northwest tonight. This will put
Ian on course toward coastal portions of southern South Carolina on
Friday as a strong tropical storm or hurricane.
Significant impacts from Ian are expected to begin late tonight and
into Friday morning across the Midlands and CSRA. Heavy rainfall may
lead to flash flooding, particularly Friday and Friday night. Tropical
storm force winds are also expected, particularly closer to the
coastal plain. There also a threat for tornadoes, but this potential
is expected to remain very limited for our area.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across the Midlands of central South Carolina
and east central Georgia CSRA.
Potential impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, arroyos, and
ditches may become dangerous rivers. In mountain areas,
destructive runoff may run quickly down valleys while
increasing susceptibility to rockslides and mudslides. Flood
control systems and barriers may become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.
Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with
underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.
Many road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
Prepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant
impacts across the Midlands of central South Carolina
and east central Georgia CSRA.
* WIND:
Prepare for dangerous wind having possible significant impacts across
the Midlands of central South Carolina and east central Georgia CSRA.
Potential impacts in this area include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
Also, prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts
across the Midlands of central South Carolina and east central
Georgia CSRA.
* TORNADOES:
Little to no additional impacts are anticipated at this time across
the Midlands of central South Carolina and east central Georgia CSRA.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies
kit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your
home or business.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, and tornadoes extend well away from the center of the
storm.
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
near a large inland lake, in a low-lying or poor drainage area, in
a valley, or near an already swollen river, plan to move to safe
shelter on higher ground.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes
to the forecast.
