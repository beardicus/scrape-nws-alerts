<description>...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in
Florida...
St Johns River Near Above Lake Harney affecting Seminole County.
.As Hurricane Ian moves into east central Florida early this
morning, historic heavy rainfall will continue, leading to quickly

At this forecast point, the river has risen to Minor Flood Stage
early this morning and is expected to rise further to Major Flood
stage by Friday morning, potentially reaching Record Flood Stage
early Sunday morning. Interests along the river should be prepared
for major flood impacts. Due to wind effects and drainage from
upstream, the river is forecast to remain in Major Flood into early
next week.

flooding is forecast.
