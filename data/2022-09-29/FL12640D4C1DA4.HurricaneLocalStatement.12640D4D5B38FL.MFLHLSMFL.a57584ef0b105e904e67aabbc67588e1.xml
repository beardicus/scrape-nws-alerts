SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Ian will move off the east coast of Florida this
morning and move slowly towards the southeast of the United States
later today into Friday. The following hazardous conditions can be
expected for South Florida:
* Storm Surge in flooded areas across Coastal Collier County will
continue to recede today. However, standing water in some areas
will still be common and could be 1 to 3 feet. Please do not
venture out into floodwater. Floodwater may contain hazardous
materials, such as downed power lines, hazardous waste, and
physical objects. You never know how deep floodwater is and what
may be in floodwater. The best way to protect yourself is to stay
out of floodwater and sheltered in place while water recedes.
Additional flooding may be possible today especially during high
tide. Please heed the advice of local emergency management
officials and first responders as search and rescue efforts are
ongoing.
* Hazardous marine, beach, and surf conditions are ongoing.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Little to no additional surge impacts expected.
- Community officials are now assessing the extent of actual
surge impacts accordingly across coastal Collier County.
- Emergency response teams are attending to casualty situations
as needed.
- Emergency work crews are restoring essential community
infrastructure as necessary.
- If you have an emergency dial 9 1 1.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
- Do not enter evacuated areas until officials have
given the all clear to return.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Do not attempt to return to evacuated areas until local authorities
give the all clear. Allow time for officials to inspect bridges and
overpasses and to mark washed-out roads.
If using a generator, avoid carbon monoxide poisoning by following
instructions provided by the manufacturer. Operate your generator in
a well-ventilated space outside of your living area and away from
open doors and windows.
Problems with sewer backups can further contaminate standing flood
waters. Keep children away from flood waters. Also, listen for boil
water alerts as tap water may have become non-potable.
Be alert for flooded roads which could be compromised or littered
with debris. Avoid travel until water levels subside and roads have
been cleared. Do not drive through places where flood waters cover
the road. Turn around, don`t drown!
