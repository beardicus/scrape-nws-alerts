<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued September 29 at 6:34AM EDT until October 01 at 8:00AM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM EDT SATURDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 8 PM THIS EVENING TO 8 PM
EDT FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 6
to 12 feet expected in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood
Advisory, 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level
expected in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways. For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip
currents, large breaking waves expected, and strong longshore
currents in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Ocracoke Island.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, from 8 PM this evening to 8
PM EDT Friday. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 8 AM EDT
Saturday. For the Beach Hazards Statement, through this
evening.
* IMPACTS...Up to 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in a low threat of property damage. Some roads and low
lying property including parking lots, parks, lawns, and homes
adjacent to the waterfront will experience shallow flooding.
Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach
erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from
shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw a
swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom causing neck and
back injuries. Strong longshore currents will create dangerous
swimming conditions.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Swimmers should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions.</instruction>
