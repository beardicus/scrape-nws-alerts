<description>This product covers eastern Florida panhandle, Florida Big Bend, southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia
** TROPICAL STORM IAN NEARING THE FLORIDA EAST COAST **
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Coastal Dixie,
Coastal Franklin, Coastal Jefferson, Coastal Taylor, Coastal
Wakulla, and Inland Dixie
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 320 miles east-southeast of Panama City or about 270
miles east-southeast of Apalachicola
- 28.0N 80.9W
- Storm Intensity 65 mph
- Movement Northeast or 40 degrees at 8 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
As of 5AM EDT, Ian was downgraded to a tropical storm while
tracking towards the Space Coast near Melbourne, Florida. Ian should
emerge off the northeast Florida coast Thursday afternoon or evening.
Although Ian is now a tropical storm, the large wind field in
conjunction with a tight pressure gradient and strong low-level winds
keeps the potential for tropical storm force winds (mainly in gusts)
across the local Gulf waters, coastal Apalachee Bay, and the southeast
Florida Big Bend. As such, Tropical Storm Warnings remain in effect
along the coast from Indian Pass to the Suwannee River, including
inland Dixie County.
Forecast rainfall amounts have now fallen below 1 inch along the I-
75 corridor and southeast Florida Big Bend. The flooding rain threat
has therefore decreased.
No tornado or storm surge impacts are expected.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
the southeast Florida Big Bend and south-central Georgia. Remain well
sheltered from hazardous wind having possible limited impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across eastern Florida panhandle, Florida Big Bend,
southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia, little to no impact is
anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
the far southeast Florida Big Bend. Remain well guarded against locally
hazardous flood waters having possible limited impacts. If realized,
these impacts include:
- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter currents.
Small streams, creeks, and ditches may become swollen and
overflow in spots.
- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually
vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding of water
occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become
near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge
closures.
Elsewhere across eastern Florida panhandle, Florida Big Bend,
southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia, little to no impact is
anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Keep your cell phone charged and in power-saving mode. If you lose
power, use it sparingly and mainly for personal emergencies and
check-ins.
Do not be a thrill seeker or risk your life for senseless photos or
videos.

Service in Tallahassee FL around 11 AM EDT, or sooner if conditions
warrant.</description>
