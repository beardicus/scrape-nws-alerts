<description>...Frost Possible From Fairbanks East Tonight...
...High Water on the Tanana River and Tributaries Draining the
Alaska Range Continues This Week...
Clouds are expected to break apart this evening with brief
clearing after midnight tonight. This will allow frost to form in
some valley locations from Fairbanks east tonight. It is expected
that patchy fog will develop after midnight tonight, and some
valleys could see dense fog with low visibility.
High water on the Tanana River and tributaries draining the
Alaska Range will continue this week. This includes the Chisana
River, Nabesna River, Gerstle River, Delta River, and the Nenana
River. The Tanana River is running near bankfull with minor
flooding possible in low lying areas from Salcha downstream to
Manley over the next several days. Heavy rain that fell over the
Alaska Range the past week is causing the high water. Rivers will
fall very slowly this week, but rain over the next several days
will cause water levels to fluctuate slightly. People recreating
or hunting on the Tanana River should be aware that all gravel
bars will be covered with water, debris will be in the river,
along with increased erosion. Be cautious of rising water levels
if you plan to park your vehicle near the river while out on your
boat.
A Flood Advisory is in effect for the Tanana River through
Wednesday from Salcha to Old Minto, including Fairbanks and Nenana.
A Flood Watch is in affect through Wednesday for the Tanana River
from Old Minto to Manley Hot Springs. Please see those products
for more details.</description>
