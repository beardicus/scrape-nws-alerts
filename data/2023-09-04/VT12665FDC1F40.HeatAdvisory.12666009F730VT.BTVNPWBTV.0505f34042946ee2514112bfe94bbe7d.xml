<headline>Heat Advisory issued September 04 at 6:56PM EDT until September 07 at 7:00PM EDT by NWS Burlington</headline>
<description>...HEAT ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM TUESDAY TO 7 PM EDT
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Heat index values up to 98 expected.
* WHERE...Grand Isle, Orange and Eastern Windsor Counties.
* WHEN...From 1 PM Tuesday to 7 PM EDT Thursday. Hottest
conditions will occur between noon and 7 PM each day.
* IMPACTS...Hot temperatures and high humidity may cause heat
illnesses to occur, especially from noon to 7 PM each day.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Temperatures will cool each night through
Thursday, but may only dip into the mid 60s to around 70
degrees briefly early each morning. The duration of cooling
may not be sufficient to effectively cool a home or other
structures, allowing for heat impacts to accumulate each day.</description>
<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
