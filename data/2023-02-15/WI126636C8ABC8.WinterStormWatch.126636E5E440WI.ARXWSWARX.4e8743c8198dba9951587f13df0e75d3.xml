<description>...Snow Threat Increasing For Thursday...
.A narrow band of heavy snow will accompany a winter storm set to
track northeast across the region Thursday. Several inches of
accumulation are possible, currently favored to extend from
central Iowa into southern Wisconsin.
With uncertainties persisting on the track of the storm, even a
small waver north or south will produce a subsequent adjustment
in how much could fall in your area. Be ready for refinements in
the forecast as we move into Thursday.

THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 4 to 7
inches possible.
* WHERE...In Iowa, Clayton County. In Wisconsin, Grant County.
* WHEN...From late tonight through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous
conditions could impact the Thursday morning commute.</description>
