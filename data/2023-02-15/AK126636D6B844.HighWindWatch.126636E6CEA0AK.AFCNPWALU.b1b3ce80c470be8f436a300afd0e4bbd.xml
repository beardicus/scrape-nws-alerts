<headline>High Wind Watch issued February 15 at 3:57PM AKST until February 16 at 9:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WATCH IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
THURSDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Southwest winds 45 to 60 mph with gusts up to 75 mph
possible.
* WHERE...Eastern Aleutians.
* WHEN...From Thursday afternoon through Thursday evening.
* IMPACTS...High winds could move loose debris, damage property,
and cause power outages. Travel could be difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...There is significant potential for a brief
period of high winds in the eastern Aleutians Thursday afternoon
or evening. Timing and strength of the winds will depend on the
exact track of a low developing in the eastern Bering Sea on
Thursday. The likelihood of high winds increases for locations
further east, with the greatest probability of high winds
expected for Dutch Harbor and a lower probability for Nikolski.</description>
<instruction>A high wind watch means there is potential for a hazardous high
wind event. Monitor the latest forecasts and warnings for updates
on this situation. Fasten loose objects or shelter objects in a
safe location prior to the onset of winds.</instruction>
