<headline>Rip Current Statement issued February 15 at 9:02PM AST until February 19 at 6:00PM AST by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM AST THURSDAY
THROUGH SUNDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Life threatening rip currents expected due to breaking
waves around 6 feet.
* WHERE...Northern and eastern exposed coastlines of Culebra,
Saint Thomas and Saint John.
* WHEN...From Thursday morning through Sunday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.</instruction>
