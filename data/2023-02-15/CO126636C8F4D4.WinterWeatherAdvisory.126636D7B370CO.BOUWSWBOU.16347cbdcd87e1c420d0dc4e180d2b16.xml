the Palmer Divide (including I-25 between Denver and Colorado
Springs), and possibly portions of I-70 through the plains. Snow
will be heaviest this morning, with lighter snow lingering much of
this afternoon and evening. In addition, gusty winds will lead to
localized blowing snow concerns especially across the plains and
Lincoln county.

TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Snow ongoing. Additional snow accumulations up to 4 inches.
Winds gusting as high as 50 mph.

* IMPACTS...Snow covered roads will make travel hazardous.</description>
<instruction>Roads will be slick resulting in slow and hazardous travel. Allow
extra time to reach your destination.
Chain and traction laws will possibly be enacted for the mountains.
If traveling to the mountains, be prepared for winter driving
conditions.</instruction>
