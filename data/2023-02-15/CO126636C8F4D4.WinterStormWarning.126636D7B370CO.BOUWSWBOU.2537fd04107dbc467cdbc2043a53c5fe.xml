this afternoon and evening. In addition, gusty winds will lead to
localized blowing snow concerns especially across the plains and
Lincoln county.

* WHAT...Heavy snow at times. Additional snow accumulations between
4 and 8 inches. Winds gusting as high as 50 mph.

* WHEN...Until Midnight MST tonight.
* IMPACTS...Snow covered roads will make travel hazardous. Travel
could be very difficult.</description>
