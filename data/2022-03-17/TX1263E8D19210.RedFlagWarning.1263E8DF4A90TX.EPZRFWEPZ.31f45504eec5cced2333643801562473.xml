<headline>Red Flag Warning issued March 17 at 6:08AM CDT until March 17 at 8:00PM CDT by NWS El Paso</headline>
<description>...Critical Fire Weather Conditions over parts of Southwest New
Mexico and far west Texas this afternoon...
.A storm system will move across New Mexico today and that will
give us strong and gusty winds across much of the region. The
strong gusty winds will combine with min RH`s in the single
digits and low teens to give us Red Flag or near Red Flag
conditions. The best chances for several hours of Red Flag
conditions will be in the Gila Region of southwest New Mexico and
in Hudspeth county in Texas. The Red Flag conditions will combine
with very dry fuels to give us critical fire weather conditions
this afternoon. The winds will slow by early evening and should
become light and variable after midnight.
