<description>...FAVORABLE MELT CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE END OF THIS
WEEK...SOMEWHAT ACCELERATED MELT AND RUNOFF EARLY NEXT WEEK...
Yesterdays /Wednesdays/ unseasonably warm temperatures, with
highs ranging from the 40s to low 50s, and overnight lows holding
near the thaw point have given a kick start to the spring thaw
process. Conditions over the next few days should help to
stabilize that process, with cooler overnight low temperatures.
Meanwhile, highly differential snow cover will expose more and
more ground to the seasonally increasing sunshine... thus the
overall snowmelt runoff process appears to be well underway, and
some far southern basin rivers and streams could start to see open
flow early next week.
Generally favorable melt conditions are expected to persist
through Sunday morning, with temperatures rising above freezing
during the daytime and cooling below freezing at night. High
temperatures will range from the upper 30s in the northern basin,
along and north of U.S. Highway 2, and the low to middle 40s in
the central and southern basin. Low temperatures will range
through the low to middle 20s north and mid to upper 20s south. No
significant precipitation is expected through Sunday morning.
From Sunday night through Tuesday morning, a low pressure system
moving into the Central Plains will pump warmer and stronger
southerly flow into the area. Temperatures on Sunday and Monday
should push into the 40s overall, edging near 50 into the far
southern basin, south of Wahpeton-Breckenridge. Low temperatures
could stay near to above freezing over large portions of the
basin on Sunday night into Monday, and across the southern basin
Monday night into Tuesday morning.
This low pressure system could produce some widespread light rain
or mixed rain and snow across the basin from Monday into Tuesday,
with total precipitation amounts currently expected to range from
one tenth to one quarter of an inch, with a 10 percent or less
chance of reaching a half inch. At this time it appears that
lesser overall precipitation amounts are favored for the Red River
corridor, westward into North Dakota, with somewhat higher
amounts favored across the forested uplands of northern and
central Minnesota.
From late Tuesday into the end of next week, temperatures should
remain somewhat above long term normals, but within a more stable
range. Highs Tuesday through Thursday are expected to range from
the upper 30s to lower 40s, with nighttime lows dropping back into
the 20s. No significant precipitation is expected for that mid to
late week period.
During the 8 to 14 day Outlook, March 24 through March 30, near
normal temperatures with slightly above normal precipitation are
indicated. The normal temperature range for the last week in
March across the Fargo-Moorhead area and far southern Red River
Basin is for highs ranging from 38 to 45 degrees and lows ranging
from 26 to 31 degrees. Normal temperatures for the last week in
March across the Grand Forks-East Grand Forks area has highs
ranging from 35 to 43 degrees and lows ranging from 24 to 28
degrees.
As open river flows kicks in, the North Central River Forecast
Center will begin to issue daily 7-day deterministic river
forecasts. And as conditions warrant, our office will issue any
pertinent river flood warnings. For the far southern Red River
Basin, this could start early next week.
There will be no additional probabilistic flood outlooks issued
this spring as we are moving into widespread melting and the
issuance of deterministic forecasts. However, an updated thaw
progress statement will be issued on Monday, March 21st, regarding
the status of snowmelt, forecast weather conditions, and the
impacts on future flood potential.</description>
