<headline>Red Flag Warning issued March 17 at 4:32AM CDT until March 17 at 10:00PM CDT by NWS Austin-San Antonio</headline>
<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM TO 10 PM TODAY FOR
LOCATIONS GENERALLY WEST OF A LINE FROM LLANO TO HONDO TO EAGLE
PASS DUE TO STRONG WINDS FROM A DRY-LINE AND TRAILING DRY COLD
FRONT...
.This afternoon...a dryline will move to near the highway 281
corridor ahead of a cold front to arrive in the evening. To the
west of this dryline, critical fire weather conditions will likely
develop with relative humidity values below 20 percent with
shifting and increasing winds coming out of the west. Sustained
winds of 20 to 30 mph could be possible with gusts up to 40 mph,
especially over Val Verde and Edwards Counties where extremely
critical fire weather conditions are expected.
Fuels are still in a cured state from the end of the winter
season, and with little precipitation in the past few months,
conditions are tinder dry.
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO 10 PM
CDT THIS EVENING DUE TO STRONG WINDS FROM A DRY-LINE AND TRAILING
DRY COLD FRONT...
The National Weather Service in Austin/San Antonio has issued a
Red Flag Warning for wind and low relative humidity, which is in
effect from 1 PM this afternoon to 10 PM CDT this evening.
* WINDS...West 10 to 20 mph with gusts up to 30 mph.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...As low as 10 percent.
* IMPACTS...Any wildfires ignited may spread rapidly and
unpredictably. Prevention of fire starts by avoiding planned
burning, or by limiting activities prone to produce sparks can
stop the start and spread of wildfires.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now....or will shortly. A combination of
strong winds...low relative humidity...and warm temperatures can
contribute to extreme fire behavior.</instruction>
