<headline>Blizzard Warning issued March 17 at 3:30PM CDT until March 18 at 7:00AM CDT by NWS Hastings</headline>
<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM THIS EVENING TO 7 AM CDT
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions expected. Total snow accumulations of
3 to 5 inches expected, with locally higher amounts possible.
North winds gusting 35 to 45 mph.
* WHERE...Rooks, Osborne and Mitchell Counties.
* WHEN...From 9 PM this evening to 7 AM CDT Friday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Heavy snow and
blowing snow will significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning commute. Gusty winds and
heavy, wet nature of the snow could bring down tree branches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Rain is forecast to change to snow after
sunset, and become heavy, at times, overnight. Peak snow rates
of 1 to 2 inches per hour are possible for several hours, and
would be enough to overwhelm near-freezing surface temperatures.
The combination of heavy snow rates and strong north winds will
likely lead to significant reductions in visibility down to
whiteout conditions during the heaviest snow. Snow will mostly
end by dawn Friday morning, but lingering effects will likely
slow the morning commute. Elevated and grassy surfaces, along
with bridges, will see the highest snowfall accumulations.</description>
<instruction>Travel should be restricted to emergencies only. If you must
travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded,
stay with your vehicle.
The latest road conditions for the state you are calling from can
be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
