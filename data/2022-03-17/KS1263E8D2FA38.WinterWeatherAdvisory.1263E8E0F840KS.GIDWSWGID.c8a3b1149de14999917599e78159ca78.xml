<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM THIS
EVENING TO 7 AM CDT FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Wet snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 4
inches. North winds gusting 35 to 40 mph.
* WHERE...Smith, Jewell and Phillips Counties.
* WHEN...From 9 PM this evening to 7 AM CDT Friday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Rain is forecast to change to snow after
sunset, and become heavy, at times, overnight. Despite
temperatures mainly above freezing, peak snow rates near 1 inch
per hour are possible, and would be enough to overwhelm
relatively warm surface temperatures. Strong, gusty north winds
are likely, so areas that do see snow will have significantly
reduced visibilities to near-blizzard conditions during the
heaviest snow. Snow will mostly end by dawn Friday morning, but
lingering effects could impact the morning commute. Elevated
and grassy surfaces, along with bridges, will see the highest
snowfall accumulations.</description>
