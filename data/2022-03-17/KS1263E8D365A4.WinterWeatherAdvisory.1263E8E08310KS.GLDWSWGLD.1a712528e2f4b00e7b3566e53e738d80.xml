<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM CDT
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy wet snow and blowing snow. Total snow accumulation
ranging anywhere from a dusting to 3 inches. North winds
gusting up to 45 mph.
* WHERE...Graham and Gove Counties.
* WHEN...From sunset this evening to 4 AM CDT Friday morning.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous travel conditions. Affected routes include
Interstate 70, Highway 283, and Highway 24.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A band of heavy snow capable of producing
blizzard conditions will develop over portions of central Kansas
this evening and overnight. Where exactly this band will develop
remains somewhat uncertain. At this time, areas along and east
of Highway 283 appear most likely to be affected. Slippery road
conditions and sudden, significant reductions in visibility
associated with heavy wet snow and blowing snow are possible for
several hours late this evening. Temperatures will remain at or
above freezing.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, slow down, turn off cruise control, and
exercise additional caution, particularly at intersections and
highway on-ramps and off-ramps where accidents are more likely to
occur. Decelerating abruptly or making sharp turns at a high rate
of speed may result in loss of vehicle control.
The latest road conditions for the state you are calling from can
be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
