<headline>Blizzard Warning issued March 17 at 9:17PM CDT until March 18 at 7:00AM CDT by NWS Hastings</headline>
<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 AM CDT FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions expected. Total snow accumulations of
3 to 5 inches expected, with locally higher amounts possible.
North winds gusting 35 to 45 mph.
* WHERE...Rooks, Mitchell and Osborne Counties.
* WHEN...Until 7 AM CDT Friday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Patchy blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning commute. Gusty winds could
bring down tree branches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Rain is gradually changing to snow, and
could become heavy, at times, overnight. Peak snow rates of 1
to 2 inches per hour are possible for several hours, and would
be enough to overwhelm near-freezing surface temperatures. The
combination of heavy snow rates and strong north winds will
likely lead to significant reductions in visibility down to
whiteout conditions during the heaviest snow. Snow will mostly
end by dawn Friday morning, but lingering effects will likely
slow the morning commute. Elevated and grassy surfaces, along
with bridges, will see the highest snowfall accumulations.</description>
