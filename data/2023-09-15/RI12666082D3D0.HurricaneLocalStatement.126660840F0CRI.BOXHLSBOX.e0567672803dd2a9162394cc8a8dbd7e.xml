SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Lee is forecast to pass offshore of southern New England on
Saturday but its impacts will extend far from the storm`s center,
mainly affecting the Massachusetts coastline.
The following are the primary hazards of concern with Lee:
* Damaging wind - Winds will increase today and remain gusty through Saturday
night. Tropical storm force winds should arrive early tonight and
continue into Saturday near the coast, especially on Cape Cod and the
Islands, where downed trees are possible. These winds combined with
high seas will also be dangerous for mariners.
* Coastal Flooding - Minor flooding is likely with pockets of moderate flooding
possible on the bay side of Cape Cod and on the northern side of
Nantucket, around high tide late Friday night and again early
Saturday afternoon. Inundation above ground level could range from 1
to 2 feet in these areas. Along the rest of the eastern Massachusetts
coast, minor flooding is expected with flooding less than one foot
deep. Large waves could bring debris onto coastal roads.
* High Surf - Dangerous surf with large breaking waves will occur along
the Massachusetts and Rhode Island coasts along with dangerous rip
currents at ocean beaches.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
coastal Massachusetts, but primarily on Cape Cod and the Islands.
Potential impacts in this area include:
- Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across Southern New England, little to no impact is
anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Have all preparations completed today to protect life and property in
accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a safe location
before the onset of strong winds, especially on Cape Cod and the
Islands.
Keep cell phones well charged. Cell phone chargers for automobiles
can be helpful, but be aware of your risk for deadly carbon monoxide
poisoning if your car is left idling in a garage or other poorly
ventilated area.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
