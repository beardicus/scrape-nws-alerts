<headline>High Surf Advisory issued September 15 at 5:04AM EDT until September 15 at 6:00PM EDT by NWS Caribou</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 11 PM THIS
EVENING TO 5 PM EDT SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, overwash is expected for
large breaking waves along the coast. These waves may cause
minor inundation along low lying areas exposed to waves and
tidal influence.
For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 3 to 6 feet
in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Coastal Hancock and Coastal Washington Counties.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, from 11 PM this evening
to 5 PM EDT Saturday. For the High Surf Advisory, until 6 PM
EDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Machias, Seawall Road on Mount Desert Island,
Schoodic Point, Deer Isle Causeway, and other low lying, tidal
influenced areas including around Lubec and Eastport may
experience minor to moderate inundation and overwash. Greatest
concern is for the Saturday high tide near noon.
High dangerous surf and strong rip currents will
make for hazardous surf conditions. Large waves can present a
danger to people on rocks above the water. Stay away from rock
outcrops along the shoreline exposed to ocean waves, as waves
can easily sweep people into the cold ocean water.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
A high surf advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in
the advisory area...producing rip currents and localized beach
erosion.</instruction>
