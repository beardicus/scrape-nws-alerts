<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued September 15 at 4:19PM EDT until September 17 at 3:00AM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT SATURDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 AM EDT
SUNDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 10
to 16 feet on into Saturday morning in the surf zone, then
gradually subsiding through the weekend. For the High Rip
Current Risk, dangerous rip currents. For the Coastal Flood
Advisory, a reasonable worst case of 1 to 2 ft of inundation
above ground level in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and
shoreline.
* WHERE...Southwest Suffolk, Southeast Suffolk and Southern
Nassau Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT Saturday.
For the High Rip Current Risk, through Saturday evening. For
the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 6 PM Friday to 3 AM EDT
Sunday, particularly during the times of high tides.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Minor flooding in the most vulnerable
locations near the waterfront and shoreline, particularly along
the north facing shorelines of the south fork of Long Island and
the north facing shorelines of the barrier islands. As much as
1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level is possible, which
will cause shallow flooding on some roads and low lying property
including parking lots, parks, lawns and homes/businesses with
basements near the waterfront.
* SWIMMING IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions
Tonight through Saturday. Life-threatening rip currents are
likely for all people entering the surf zone. Anyone visiting
the beaches should stay out of the surf. Rip currents can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* BEACH EROSION AND FLOODING IMPACTS...Large breaking waves will
result in widespread areas of dune erosion and scattered
overwashes through Saturday high tides. This may result in
scattered areas of minor to moderate flooding of roadways and
vulnerable structures behind protective dunes.
* FORECAST CHALLENGES...There is still uncertainty in the timing
of peak surge relative to the times of high tide Tonight into
Saturday, the magnitude of wave setup effects over several tidal
cycles, and the fact that Lee is expected to transition to an
extra- tropical storm. For this reason, this coastal flood
forecast represents a reasonable worst case forecast, to include
a safety margin for preparation.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
