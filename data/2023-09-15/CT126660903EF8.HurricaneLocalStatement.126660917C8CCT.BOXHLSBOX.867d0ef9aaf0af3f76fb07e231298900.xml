SATURDAY MORNING**
NEW INFORMATION

- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Barnstable MA, Dukes
MA, Eastern Essex MA, Eastern Norfolk MA, Eastern Plymouth MA,
Nantucket MA, Southern Bristol MA, Southern Plymouth MA,
Suffolk MA, and Western Plymouth MA

SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Lee is forecast to pass offshore of southern New England on
Saturday but its impacts will extend far from the storm`s center,
mainly affecting the Massachusetts coastline.
The following are the primary hazards of concern with Lee:
* Damaging wind - Tropical storm force winds, mainly in gusts, have
arrived on Cape Cod and the Islands, and will spread to rest of the
coastline overnight, lasting through most of the day Saturday. Gusts
as high as 60 mph are expected on Cape Cod and Nantucket where the
wind will be capable of bringing down trees and large branches. These
winds combined with high seas will also be very dangerous for
mariners.
* Coastal Flooding - Minor flooding is likely around high tide late
tonight. Pockets of moderate flooding are possible on the bay side of
Cape Cod and on the northern side of Nantucket, including Nantucket
Harbor, where flooding could be 1 to 2 feet deep. Large waves could
bring debris onto coastal roads. Another round of minor flooding is
possible with the Saturday afternoon high tide, with the greatest
risk on the bay side of Cape Cod and northern side of Nantucket.
* High Surf - Dangerous surf with large breaking waves will occur along
the Massachusetts and Rhode Island coasts along with dangerous rip
currents at ocean beaches.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
Cape Cod and the Islands. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across Southern New England, little to no impact is
anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Keep cell phones well charged. Cell phone chargers for automobiles can
be helpful, but be aware of your risk for deadly carbon monoxide
poisoning if your car is left idling in a garage or other poorly
ventilated area.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.

Service in Boston/Norton MA around 6 AM EDT Saturday, or sooner if
conditions warrant.</description>
