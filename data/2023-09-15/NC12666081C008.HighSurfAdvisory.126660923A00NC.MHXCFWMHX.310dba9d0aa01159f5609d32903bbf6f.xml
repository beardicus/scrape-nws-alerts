<headline>High Surf Advisory issued September 15 at 4:02AM EDT until September 16 at 12:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON EDT SATURDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EDT
TONIGHT...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 9 to
15 feet in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, 1 to
2 feet of inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways. For the Beach Hazards Statement,
dangerous rip currents and large breaking waves in the surf
zone.
* WHERE...West Carteret and Coastal Onslow Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until noon EDT Saturday.
For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until midnight EDT tonight.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Up to 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level
is possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways resulting in a low threat of property damage. Some
roads and low lying property including parking lots, parks,
lawns, and homes adjacent to the waterfront will experience
shallow flooding. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions
and localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the
best swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Dangerous
shore break can throw a swimmer or surfer head first into the
bottom causing neck and back injuries.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most critical factor in this event will
be the powerful ocean wave run up, which may bring seawater up
and over vulnerable dune structures, across roads, and onto
properties. High tide is around 8:30 AM this morning and 8:30 PM
this evening.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
