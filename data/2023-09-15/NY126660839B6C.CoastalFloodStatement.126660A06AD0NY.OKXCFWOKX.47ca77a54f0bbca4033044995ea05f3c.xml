<headline>Coastal Flood Statement issued September 15 at 4:19PM EDT until September 17 at 5:00AM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT SATURDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE
SATURDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 4 to
8 feet into Saturday morning in the surf zone, then gradually
subsiding through the weekend. For the High Rip Current Risk,
dangerous rip currents. For the Coastal Flood Statement, a
reasonable worst case of up to 1 ft of inundation above ground
level expected in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and
shoreline.
* WHERE...Kings (Brooklyn) County.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT Saturday. For
the High Rip Current Risk, through Saturday evening. For the
Coastal Flood Statement, from Friday evening through late
Saturday night.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Brief minor flooding of the most
vulnerable locations near the waterfront and shoreline.
* SWIMMING IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions
Tonight through Saturday. Life-threatening rip currents are
likely for all people entering the surf zone. Anyone visiting
the beaches should stay out of the surf. Rip currents can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* BEACH EROSION AND FLOODING IMPACTS...Scattered areas of dune
erosion are likely through Saturday.
* FORECAST CHALLENGES...There is still uncertainty in the timing
of peak surge relative to the times of high tide Tonight into
Saturday, the magnitude of wave setup effects over several tidal
cycles, and the fact that Lee is expected to transition to an
extra- tropical storm. For this reason, this coastal flood
forecast represents a reasonable worst case forecast, to include
a safety margin for preparation.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>Do not drive through flooded roadways.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
