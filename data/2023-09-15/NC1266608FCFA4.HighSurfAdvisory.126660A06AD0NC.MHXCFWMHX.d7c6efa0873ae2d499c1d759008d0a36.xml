<headline>High Surf Advisory issued September 15 at 8:17PM EDT until September 17 at 5:00AM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON EDT
SATURDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 AM EDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents
and large breaking waves in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood
Warning, 2 to 4 feet of inundation above ground level in low-
lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways. For the High
Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 7 to 12 feet in the surf
zone.
* WHERE...Hatteras Island.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, through Saturday
evening. For the Coastal Flood Warning, until noon EDT
Saturday. For the High Surf Advisory, until 5 AM EDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Up to 2 to 4 feet of inundation above ground level
is possible in some areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in an elevated threat of property damage. Flooding
will extend inland from the waterfront threatening some homes
and businesses. Inundation of portions of Hwy 12 around high
tide is likely. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore
break can throw a swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom
causing neck and back injuries.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most critical factor in this event
will be the powerful ocean wave run up, which will bring
seawater up and over vulnerable dune structures, across roads,
and onto properties. High tide is at 8:30 PM this evening, and
low tide is around 9 AM Saturday morning.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
