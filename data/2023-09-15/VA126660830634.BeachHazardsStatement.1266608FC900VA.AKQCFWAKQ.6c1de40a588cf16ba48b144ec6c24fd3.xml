<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued September 15 at 12:37PM EDT until September 15 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Wakefield</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM EDT SATURDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 7 to
10 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards Statement, a
high risk for rip currents.
* WHERE...Virginia Beach.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 4 AM EDT Saturday.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, until 8 PM EDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Large breaking waves of 7 to 10 ft
will result in dangerous surf conditions. Do not enter or
approach the water due to the risk of being swept away.</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
