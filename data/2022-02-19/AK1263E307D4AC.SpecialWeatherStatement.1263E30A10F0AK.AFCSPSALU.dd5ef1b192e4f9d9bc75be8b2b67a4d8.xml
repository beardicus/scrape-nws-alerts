<description>...WINTRY MIX EXPECTED FOR SOUTHWEST ALASKA THROUGH THE WEEKEND...
A series of weak fronts will move through Southwest Alaska this
weekend, each bringing multiple types of precipitation. Snow has
developed this afternoon along the Southwest coast and is pushing
into the interior of Southwest in advance of the first front. A
brief period of freezing rain is possible for these areas Saturday
evening as warmer air moves overhead. Any ice accumulations are
expected to be less than five hundredths of an inch, with areas
between Togiak and Kipnuk and being the most likely to receive any
freezing rain. Impacts are expected to be minimal as winds will
become southerly on Sunday, warming temperatures above freezing
and transitioning remaining precipitation to all rain.
Another much warmer front will move into the region mid-day on
Sunday. This will produce widespread rain with temperatures in
the mid to upper 30s. The higher chance of freezing rain will
shift into the Lower Kuskokwim Valley, potentially bringing light
freezing rain to villages from Aniak east. Impacts are expected
to be minimal with all areas likely to be in the mid to upper 30s
by Monday; however, warm temperatures and rain may result in slick
conditions throughout the area by early next week as compacted
snow begins to melt.</description>
