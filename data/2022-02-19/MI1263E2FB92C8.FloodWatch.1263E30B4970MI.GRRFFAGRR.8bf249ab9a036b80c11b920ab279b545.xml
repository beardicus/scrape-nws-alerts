<description>.An ice jam may cause water to infiltrate the lowlands along the
river.
...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of southwest Michigan, including the following
county, Ottawa.
This includes the Grand River in the vicinity of Robinson Township
and Eastmanville.
* WHEN...Through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Localized flooding of low lying areas and property along
the Grand River may occur upstream and downstream of the ice jam.
Rapid water level fluctuations may occur due to heavy ice cover on
the river.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Based on river gages and county official observations, an ice
jam exists on the Grand River between Robinson Township and
Eastmanville.  Water levels were fluctuating in this region.
A report from a county official in the Eastmanville area
indicated large sheets of ice were present there. At this
time no flooding was known, however given the unstable ice
situation present, an increased risk for flooding exists in
this region of the Grand River.  Close monitoring of the
situation will be needed until the ice clears.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
