<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WILL AFFECT ALLEGANY COUNTY...
At 1156 AM EST, a snow squall was located along a line extending from
Buffalo Mills to Berlin to near Meyersdale to Friendsville. Movement
was southeast at 30 mph. A line of snow showers may cause
Visibilities to briefly drop below a half mile and an inch of snow
will be possible in a short time period.
Winds in excess of 30 mph are possible with this squall.
Locations impacted include...
Cumberland, Frostburg, Westernport, Bel Air, La Vale, Lonaconing,
Piedmont, Ridgeley, Cresaptown, Potomac Park, Wiley Ford, Eckhart
Mines, Mount Savage, Rawlings, Ellerslie, Barton, Corriganville,
Midland, Midlothian and Franklin.
Use extra caution if you must travel into or through this dangerous
snow squall. Rapid changes in visibility and potentially slick roads
are likely to lead to accidents. Consider delaying travel until the
squall passes your location.</description>
