HAZARD...Extremely poor visibility in heavy snow and blowing snow.
Wind gusts greater than 35 mph.

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.
There is no safe place on a highway when a snow squall hits.
Visibility and traction are immediately lost in whiteout conditions,
making it difficult or impossible to slow down and avoid stopped
vehicles. Delay travel or safely exit the highway before the snow
squall arrives.</description>
