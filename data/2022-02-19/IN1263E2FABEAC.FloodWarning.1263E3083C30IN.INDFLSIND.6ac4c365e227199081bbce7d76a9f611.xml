.A combination of snow melt and rainfall from Wednesday night
through Thursday with 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain falling on saturated
ground.  This has lead to widespread flooding across central Indiana
with many smaller streams and rivers either in flood or nearing
flood stage.  The flooding along small creeks has generally ended
with smaller streams and rivers either crested or nearly crested.
Flooding along the main stem rivers will continue to worsen through
the weekend with moderate flooding expected along portions of the
Upper Wabash River. Further downstream, flooding will continue
through at least next week.  Another series of rain events are
possible next week which would prolong and potentially exacerbate
ongoing flooding.
...FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Wabash River at Hutsonville Legacy Power Plant Site.
* WHEN...Until further notice.
* IMPACTS...At 22.0 feet, River cabins become isolated.  Basement
flooding begins in Hutsonville.  Extensive agricultural flooding
is in progress.  Higher Illinois rural roads in eastern Clark and
Crawford counties flood.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- There is no current observed data.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise to a crest of 22.4
feet Wednesday evening.
- Flood stage is 16.0 feet.
