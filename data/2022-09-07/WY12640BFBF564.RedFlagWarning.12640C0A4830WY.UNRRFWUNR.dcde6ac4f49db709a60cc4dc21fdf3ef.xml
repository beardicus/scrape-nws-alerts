<headline>Red Flag Warning issued September 07 at 3:13AM MDT until September 07 at 9:00PM MDT by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>.Hot and very dry conditions are expected today with relative
humidity in the 10 to 20 percent range. Critical fire weather
conditions are expected to develop across portions of northeast
Wyoming gusty southwest winds develop in the afternoon. Poor
relative humidity recovery is expected across much of the region
tonight as breezy and dry south/southwest winds develop ahead of a
strong cold front. On Thursday, low relative humidity and gusty
winds ahead of and behind the strong cold front may lead to
widespread critical fire weather conditions, especially east and
south of the Black Hills. Good chances for wetting rains arrive
Thursday night, bringing an end to the fire weather threat.

THIS EVENING FOR GUSTY WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR FIRE
