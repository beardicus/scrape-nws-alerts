<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, one to two feet of
inundation above ground level expected in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways. For the High Rip Current Risk,
dangerous rip currents expected.
* WHERE...In Delaware, Delaware Beaches. In New Jersey, Atlantic
Coastal Cape May and Coastal Atlantic.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 4 PM this
afternoon to 10 PM EDT this evening. For the High Rip Current
Risk, through Thursday evening.
* IMPACTS...At this level, flooding begins on the most
vulnerable roads in coastal and bayside communities, and along
inland tidal waterways. Some partial or full road closures are
possible. At this level, widespread roadway flooding occurs in
coastal and bayside communities and along inland tidal
waterways. Many roads become impassable. Some damage to
vulnerable structures may begin to occur. Rip currents can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...While widespread minor coastal flooding is
expected, isolated areas may experience moderate flooding around
high tide. Tidal flooding should be anticipated once again
Thursday evening.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>A Coastal Flood Advisory means that minor tidal flooding is
expected. Minor tidal flooding often results in some road
closures. Usually, the most vulnerable roadways will flood.
Do not leave your vehicle at a location that is prone to tidal
flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flood waters. The
water may be deeper than you think it is. You will be putting
yourself in danger and your vehicle may be damaged, leading to
costly repairs.
Visit the Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service at
water.weather.gov/ahps for additional water level and flood
impact information for your local tide gauge.
Entering the surf is discouraged. If caught in a rip current,
relax and float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
