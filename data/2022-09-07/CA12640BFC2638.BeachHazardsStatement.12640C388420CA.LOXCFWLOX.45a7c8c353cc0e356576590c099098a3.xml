<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY MORNING
THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Dangerous rip currents and breaking waves due to high
surf of 4 to 7 feet on south facing beaches of Ventura and Los
Angeles Counties. Breaking waves of 3 to 6 feet are expected on
beaches of southeastern Santa Barbara County. Surf could
possibly be higher under certain circumstances. Breaking waves
of 4 to 6 feet are likely to affect Catalina Island, including
portions of Avalon Harbor. Waves may be higher there if
accompanied by strong winds.
* WHERE...Catalina and Santa Barbara Islands, Santa Barbara
County Southeastern Coast, Ventura County Beaches, Malibu
Coast and Los Angeles County Beaches.
* WHEN...From Friday morning through Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...This will likely lead to dangerous surf conditions
with an increased risk of ocean drowning. Minor tidal overflow
during the time of high tide, mainly Friday and Saturday
evenings, but possibly Thursday evening.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...This is an extended outlook for the
potential of high surf. A High Surf Advisory will likely be
needed in a few days.</description>
