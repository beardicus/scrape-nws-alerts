<senderName>NWS RapidCity (Western South Dakota and Northeastern Wyoming)</senderName>
<headline>Red Flag Warning issued September 07 at 1:38PM MDT until September 08 at 7:00PM MDT by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>.Hot and very dry conditions will persist across northeastern WY
and much of western SD this afternoon into this evening. Breezy
winds will also continue across portions of northeastern WY,
leading to critical fire weather conditions for the remainder of
the afternoon into the evening.
Late this evening into tonight, winds will decrease over the
northeastern WY plains but increase over the northern and
eastern foothills eastward onto the SD plains. These winds will
limit overnight relative humidity recovery and likely lead to the
development of critical fire weather conditions across the
northern and eastern foothills late this evening through much of
tomorrow.
A trough crossing the area tomorrow will bring an abrupt
shift to breezy northwesterly winds while relative humidity
values remain low, leading to more widespread critical fire
weather conditions across much of western and central SD into
southern portions of northeastern WY from late tomorrow morning
through the afternoon.
