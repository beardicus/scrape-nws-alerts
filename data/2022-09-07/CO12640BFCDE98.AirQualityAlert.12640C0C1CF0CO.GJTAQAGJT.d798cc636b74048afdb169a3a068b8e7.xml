The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has
issued the following...

WHEN...900 AM Wednesday September 07 to 900 AM Thursday September

IMPACTS...Periods of moderate to heavy smoke from several out-of-
state wildfires will impact north-central Colorado through at
least early Thursday morning. The heaviest smoke impacts are most
likely for sheltered valley locations.
HEALTH INFORMATION...Public Health Recommendations: If smoke is

Consider relocating temporarily if smoke is present indoors and is
making you ill. If visibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in
your neighborhood, smoke has reached levels that are unhealthy.</description>
