<description>...ISOLATED TO SCATTERED DRY THUNDERSTORMS ON WEDNESDAY ALONG
WITH STRONG, GUSTY WINDS AND LOW RH FOR PORTIONS OF THE AREA...
.A trough will move through on Wednesday bringing additional
gusty winds and dry humidities, especially over the East Side and
in NE California. Isolated to perhaps scattered dry thunderstorms
are possible Wednesday too along a line stretching from Siskiyou
County, including the Mountain and Mill Fires northeastward into
Oregon. These thunderstorms will bring very little, if any rain.
However, they could produce gusty, shifting winds up to 45 mph.
Then, the thermal trough quickly redevelops Friday bringing a
period of east winds with poor recoveries and very low daytime RHs
to the Cascades and foothills.
