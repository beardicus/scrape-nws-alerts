<description>...MULTIPLE DAYS OF HEAVY RAINFALL EXPECTED THROUGH THIS
WEEKEND...
...FLASH FLOODING POSSIBLE ON FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY...
...COASTAL RIVERINE FLOOD THREAT POTENTIALLY DEVELOPING THIS
WEEKEND...
.Antecedent Conditions...
Over the 30 days, rainfall has been much above normal across the
entire region, with some areas in the Florida Big Bend running 5-8
inches above normal. As a result, soils are fairly moist based on
CREST analysis which shows much of the Florida Big Bend near 75%
saturation with some pockets of 75-85% saturation in Madison
County and along the Apalachicola River south of Bristol. Needless
to say, North Florida is vulnerable to flash flooding.
.Flood Potential and Impacts...
With precipitable water values increasing Thursday and into
Friday, the atmosphere will be primed to produce locally heavy
rainfall. While the large scale pattern is supportive of heavy
rainfall, the remaining question is exactly where the heaviest
amounts will occur. Coastal areas often seem to receive the
highest totals in these types of patterns, and our latest forecast
features this, with 4-6 inches of rain along the coastal areas
from Apalachicola eastward around Apalachee Bay. Isolated heavier
totals are possible, especially if thunderstorms stall along the
coastal interface. Should this occur, very heavy rainfall
accumulations are possible in a short period of time, which could
produce dangerous flash flooding.
Slightly lower amounts are anticipated further inland to Interstate
10 and along the FL/GA border. Even so, with 2-4 inches expected
in these areas, isolated heavier totals are possible, and if
falling in a short period of time over already saturated soils,
flash flooding could happen fairly quickly.
The main impact with this system is the potential for flash
flooding.  The entire region is outlined in a slight risk for
excessive rainfall on Friday. This is when the heaviest rain
should occur across the region. However, with the moist air mass
remaining in place, additional heavy rain is anticipated through
the weekend, further adding to the flood threat.
With multiple days of heavy rainfall, the potential for minor
river flooding exists in our coastal basins. The more vulnerable
basins are the Sopchoppy, St Marks, Aucilla, and Steinhatchee.
Rainfall amounts of 4 to 6 inches in these basins would only
produce minor riverine flooding. Higher amounts, in excess of 8
inches, would bring the potential for moderate riverine flooding.
.Preparedness Actions...
Should models continue to indicate an increased likelihood of a heavy
rainfall, a flood watch may be issued for a portion of our area
as soon as Thursday.
Residents living in areas vulnerable to flash flooding should
consider evaluating their flood risk and be prepared to take
action to protect themselves and property from flood damage.
People living near small streams and area rivers should also be
alert to rapid rises in water level and be prepared to take action
if warnings are issued.
