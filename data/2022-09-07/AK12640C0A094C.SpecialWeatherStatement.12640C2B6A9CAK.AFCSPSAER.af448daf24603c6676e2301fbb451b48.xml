<description>...Periods of Heavy rain for the Seward area Thursday...
A strong low pressure system will bring in an atmospheric river
of moisture from the tropical Pacific. This system will bring
periods of moderate to heavy rain increasing in intensity tonight
and tomorrow morning for the Seward area.
Expect 2 to 3 inches of rain through Thursday night with up to 5
inches in the surrounding mountains near Seward. Additional light
rain will continue off and on through Saturday with up to a half
inch of additional rainfall.
The rain will produce rises to the rivers and streams near Seward
These area rivers may approach bankfull conditions on Thursday
and continuing through Saturday.
Additionally, a glacial dammed lake on Bear Glacier in the Fjords
National Park near Seward continues to releases water. This may
wash some glacial ice chunks from the Bear Glacier Lagoon into
Resurrection Bay. This ice is a hazard to boaters. Anyone boating
in Resurrection Bay should be alert to avoid running into these
ice chunks.</description>
