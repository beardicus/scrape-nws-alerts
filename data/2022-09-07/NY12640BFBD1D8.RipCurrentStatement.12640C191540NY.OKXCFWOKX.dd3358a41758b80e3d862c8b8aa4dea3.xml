<headline>Rip Current Statement issued September 07 at 4:22AM EDT until September 08 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT IN EFFECT EARLY THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
For the Coastal Flood Statement, up to one half foot of
inundation above ground level expected in vulnerable areas
near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...Kings (Brooklyn), Southern Queens and Southern Nassau
Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Thursday
evening. For the Coastal Flood Statement, for this evening`s high
tide.
* IMPACTS...Brief minor flooding of the more vulnerable locations
near the waterfront and shoreline. Life-threatening rip currents
are likely for all people entering the surf zone. Anyone visiting
the beaches should stay out of the surf. Rip currents can sweep even
the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Minor coastal flooding is possible with
evening high tides into the weekend. Dangerous rip currents are likely
to continue Friday into this weekend as energetic swells from
distant Tropical Cyclone Earl affect our shoreline.</description>
<instruction>Do not drive through flooded roadways.
If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
