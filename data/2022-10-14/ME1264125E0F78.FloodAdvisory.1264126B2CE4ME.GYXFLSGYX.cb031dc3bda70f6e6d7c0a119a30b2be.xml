<headline>Flood Advisory issued October 14 at 2:38PM EDT until October 15 at 12:33AM EDT by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>.Moderate to occasionally heavy rainfall continues to fall over
parts of western Maine which will likely lead to minor flooding in
poor drainage areas. The combination of clogged storm drains and
ample runoff will make this more likely in urbanized locations. In
addition, high tide is approaching near the coast and will slow
runoff reaching the ocean.
...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 545 PM EDT THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Urban and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Portions of south central and southwest Maine, including
the following counties, in south central Maine, Kennebec, Lincoln
and Sagadahoc. In southwest Maine, Androscoggin and Cumberland.
* WHEN...Until 545 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
Ponding of water in urban or other areas is occurring or is
imminent.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 238 PM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated heavy rain due to thunderstorms. This will cause
urban and small stream flooding. Overflowing poor drainage
areas will cause minor flooding in the advisory area. Between
1.5 and 2.5 inches of rain have fallen.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 1.5 inches are expected
over the area. This additional rain will result in minor
flooding.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Portland, Lewiston, South Portland, Auburn, Brunswick,
Augusta, Westbrook, Bath, Gardiner, and Topsham.

In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
