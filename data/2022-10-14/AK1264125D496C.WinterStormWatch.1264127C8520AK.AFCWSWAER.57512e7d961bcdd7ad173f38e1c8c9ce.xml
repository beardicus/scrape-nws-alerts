<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued October 14 at 5:31AM AKDT until October 16 at 10:00AM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY MORNING THROUGH
SUNDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation possible. Total snow
accumulations of 1 to 4 inches and ice accumulations up to a
quarter of an inch possible.
* WHERE...Copper River Basin.
* WHEN...From Saturday morning through Sunday morning.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Travel could be
hazardous. Power outages are possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A storm system will bring another round of
heavy precipitation to the Copper River Basin for Saturday.
This system will usher in warm air aloft that will ride overtop
the cold air in place near the surface. This will mean that any
snow that does develop Saturday morning could change to a wintry
mix of snow, sleet, and freezing rain. As temperatures continue
to warm aloft Saturday afternoon, the precipitation is expected
to become mainly freezing rain, especially from the junction of
the Richardson and Edgerton Highways north. Temperatures will
slowly warm above freezing from south to north through the
latter half of Saturday, with most locations changing to all
rain by Sunday morning.</description>
