<description>...A WINTRY MIX OF PRECIPITATION POSSIBLE SATURDAY MORNING...
A warm front will lift north across the Southcentral coast for
Saturday morning. Snow is expected to develop by early Saturday
morning. However, as the front moves overhead, warmer air aloft
will move across across Valdez and through Thompson Pass. Any snow
is expected to changeover to a wintry mix of snow, sleet, and
freezing rain before changing over to all rain later Saturday
morning. A wintry mix of precipitation may also linger into early
Saturday afternoon through Thompson Pass before winds shift to the
south and the precipitation transitions to all rain.
There is still some uncertainty in how long any freezing
precipitation may linger before changing over to all rain.
However, any ice accumulations on area roads, especially along
the Richardson Highway, could lead to potentially hazardous
travel conditions.
