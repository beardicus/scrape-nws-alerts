<instruction>A Winter Storm Warning means significant amounts of snow, sleet,
and ice are expected or occurring. This will make travel very
hazardous or impossible. Only travel in an emergency. If you must
travel, keep a flashlight, food, and water in your vehicle in case
of an emergency. Prepare for possible power outages.
A Wind Chill Advisory means that very cold air and strong winds
will combine to generate low wind chills. This will result in
frost bite and lead to hypothermia if precautions are not taken.
If you must venture outdoors, make sure you wear a hat and
gloves.
Stay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio or your favorite source of
weather information for the latest updates. Additional details
