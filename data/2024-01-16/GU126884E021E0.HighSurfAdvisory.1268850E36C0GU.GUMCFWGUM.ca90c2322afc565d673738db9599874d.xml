<headline>High Surf Advisory issued January 16 at 4:00AM ChST until January 19 at 6:00AM ChST by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM CHST FRIDAY...
...HIGH RISK OF RIP CURRENTS THROUGH LATE THURSDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Large breaking waves of 7 to 9 ft, increasing to 12 to 14 ft
Wednesday, along with dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...West and North facing reefs of the Marianas.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 6 AM ChST Friday. For
the High Rip Current Risk, through late Thursday night.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Surf may drop below 9 feet briefly today, but
is expected to quickly rebuild by Wednesday as a new north-
northwest swell generated by synoptic features near Japan arrives.
Surf may also exceed 15 feet along north facing reefs. As this
event evolves, the swell will become more northeasterly,
potentially expanding hazardous surf and introducing a high risk of
rip currents to east facing reefs in the second half of the week.
&amp;&amp;</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and float.
Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a direction
following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the shore and call
or wave for help.</instruction>
