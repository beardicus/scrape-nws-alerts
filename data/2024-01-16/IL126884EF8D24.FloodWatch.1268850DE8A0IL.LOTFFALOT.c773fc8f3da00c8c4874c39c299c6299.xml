&amp;&amp;</description>
<instruction>A Flood Watch means water levels above flood stage are possible, but
not yet certain, based upon the latest forecasts. Persons along the
Des Plaines River should be prepared to take action should flooding
develop.
An ice jam is affecting water levels in this area. River forecasts
during ice jams are less certain due to many complicated factors.
Significant river ice cover can cause large water level fluctuations
and flooding with little advanced notice.
The next statement will be issued by Wednesday morning at 715 AM CST.</instruction>
