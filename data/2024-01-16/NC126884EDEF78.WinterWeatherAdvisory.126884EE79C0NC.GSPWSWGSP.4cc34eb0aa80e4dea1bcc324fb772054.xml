<instruction>A Winter Weather Advisory for freezing rain means that periods of
freezing rain or freezing drizzle will cause travel difficulties.
Be prepared for slippery roads. Slow down and use caution while
driving.
A Wind Chill Advisory means that very cold air and strong winds
will combine to generate low wind chills. This will result in
frost bite and lead to hypothermia if precautions are not taken.
If you must venture outdoors, make sure you wear a hat and
gloves.
