<description>...BLACK ICE TO PERSIST OVERNIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING RESULTING
IN HAZARDOUS TRAVEL CONDITIONS...
A recent mix of snow, sleet, rain, and freezing rain combined
temperatures near or below freezing will continue to result in
hazardous travel conditions overnight and during the Wednesday
morning commute. Black ice is already occurring or expected to
occur across the entirety of southern New England.
While portions of interior Massachusetts and Connecticut remained
below freezing for the duration of the day and evening, a period
of freezing rain this afternoon resulted in a glaze of ice over
the fresh snowpack, thus, slick travel conditions have persisted
for the last several hours and will continue to persist on
untreated surfaces.
Portions of SE MA, including the Cape and Islands, will drop below
freezing overnight, such that any standing water will freeze.
Drivers are urged to take extra precautions, including driving at
speeds dictated by conditions and leaving extra space between
vehicles. Additionally, drivers should be aware that black ice can
be very difficult to differentiate from wet roadways, and that
bridges freeze first!</description>
