* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1258 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms between the National Radio Astronomy
Observatory and Magdalena near and just north of Highway 60.
This will cause arroyo and small stream flooding. Between
0.75 and 2 inches of rain have fallen.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 0.25 to 0.75 inches are
expected over the area. This additional rain will result in
minor flooding.

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Arroyos, streams, and normally dry rivers can become raging killer
currents in a matter of minutes. Water in arroyos can travel many
miles and take hours to reach your location from upstream rain areas.</instruction>
