<headline>Flood Warning issued August 24 at 2:32PM CDT until August 26 at 11:07PM CDT by NWS Midland-Odessa</headline>
<description>...Forecast flooding changed from Minor to Moderate severity and
increased in duration for the following rivers in Texas...
Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch affecting Brewster County.
Rio Grande at Boquillas affecting Brewster County.
.Recent heavy rains upstream and flows out of Old Mexico from the
Rio Conchos basin have resulted in increased flows. Additional
rainfall over the next few days could result in additional rises
and/or flooding.
For the Rio Grande...including Johnson Ranch, Boquillas...Moderate
flooding is forecast.
...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY MORNING TO LATE FRIDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Moderate flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch.
* WHEN...From Thursday morning to late Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...At 12.0 feet (3.7 meters), the river reaches bankfull,
minor lowland flooding occurs, and no significant damage is
expected.
At 15.0 feet (4.6 meters), flood stage is reached.  Moderate
lowland flooding begins.  Roads that lead to Cottonwood Campground
and River Road may flood.  Stages are practically synonymous with
the gage at Cottonwood Campground at Castolon (CSTT2), and
therefore represent the reach from Santa Elena Canyon through
Cottonwood Campground, where damage may occur.  Cattle also graze
in the lowlands, and may be threatened.
At 19.0 feet (5.8 meters), the river reaches major flood stage.
Flooding begins to occur upstream in Cottonwood Campground at
Castolon, as stages at each location are practically synonymous.
Moderate lowland flooding begins at the gage site, but no damage
occurs.  The gage is inaccessible, as River Road is impassable at
several locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 2:15 PM CDT Wednesday the stage was 10.6 feet (3.2
meters).
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above flood stage
tomorrow morning to a crest of 18.1 feet (5.5 meters) late
tomorrow evening. It will then fall below flood stage late
Friday morning.
- Flood stage is 15.0 feet (4.6 meters).
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
17.1 feet (5.2 meters) on 07/26/2004.
