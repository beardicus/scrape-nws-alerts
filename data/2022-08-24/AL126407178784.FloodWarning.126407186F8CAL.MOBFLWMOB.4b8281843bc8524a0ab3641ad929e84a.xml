<headline>Flood Warning issued August 24 at 8:21PM CDT  by NWS Mobile</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Mobile has issued a
* Flood Warning for...
Choctaw County in southwestern Alabama...
Clarke County in southwestern Alabama...
* Until 215 AM CDT.
* At 821 PM CDT, River and creek gauge reports indicated that
several area creeks and streams were still rapidly rising due to
heavier rainfall runoff and flash flooding earlier. Flooding is
already occurring in the warned area and will continue over the
next couple of hours as storm runoff continues to drain.
* Area creeks and streams will likely over flow their banks
potentially threatening low lying areas and roads near said
creeks. This includes areas near Bassett Creek which has reached
11.81 feet and still rapidly rising. Flooding along highway 43
begins around 12 feet near the Thomasville area in Clarke county.
Culverts under roads will continue to be under high stress as
water slowly drains across the area and further road washouts will
be possible.
* Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Jackson, Thomasville, Butler, Grove Hill, Whatley, Lisman,
Coffeeville, Pennington, Fulton, Gilbertown, Toxey, Smyer,
Failetown, Campbell, Woods Bluff, Cunningham, Morvin, McEntyre,
Slater and West Bend.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
