<description>...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in New
Mexico...
Pecos River near Artesia 6E affecting Eddy County.
.Thunderstorms producing very heavy rainfall have produced abundant
rainfall on the Pecos watershed upstream of Artesia.  The Pecos
River at Artesia is expected to rise into flood over the next couple
of days, dependent on a flood wave from Lake Arthur.
For the Pecos River...including Artesia 6E...Minor flooding is
forecast.

flooding occurs about 1/2 mile upstream from the gage and spreads
onto the flood plain.  As a result, river width increases to
approximately 1 mile in some reaches.  Minor flooding of low-lying
areas occurs, but no significant damage is expected.
At 12.5 feet, the river reaches minor flood stage.  Structures at
Wilbank Trucking, Inc., located approximately 1/4 mile east of the
gage, begin to flood.
At 13.5 feet, the river reaches the floor of the instrument shelter.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...

Weather Service when you can do so safely.
Motorists should not attempt to drive around barricades or drive
cars through flooded areas.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. Most flood related deaths
occur in automobiles. Do not attempt to cross water covered bridges,
dips, or low water crossings. Never try to cross a flowing stream,
even a small one, on foot. To escape rising water find another route
over higher ground.
