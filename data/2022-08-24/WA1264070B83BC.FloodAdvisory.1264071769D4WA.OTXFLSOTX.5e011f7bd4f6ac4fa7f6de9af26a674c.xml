<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Move away from recently burned areas, including the Chuweah Creek
Fire near Nespelem. Life-threatening flooding of creeks and roads is
possible. The heavy rains could also trigger rockslides, mudslides
and debris flows in steep terrain, especially in and around these
areas.</instruction>
