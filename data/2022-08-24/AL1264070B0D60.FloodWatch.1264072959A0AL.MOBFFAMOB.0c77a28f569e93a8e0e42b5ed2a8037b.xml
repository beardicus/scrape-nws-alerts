<headline>Flood Watch issued August 24 at 2:44PM CDT until August 26 at 1:00PM CDT by NWS Mobile</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY EVENING...
The Flood Watch is now in effect for
* Portions of southwest Alabama and southeast Mississippi, including
the following areas, in southwest Alabama, Choctaw. In southeast
Mississippi, Perry and Wayne.
* Through Thursday evening.
* Additional rounds of locally heavy rain are expected across the
region through Thursday. A very moist airmass is in place and with
slow storm motions expected and storms likely training over the
same area another 3 to 5 inches of rain will be possible. With the
already saturated soils this could quickly lead to runoff and
flash flooding of low lying and poorly draining areas.
* Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers, creeks,
streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
