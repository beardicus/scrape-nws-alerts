* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 442 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms east of Algodones. This will cause arroyo and
small stream flooding. Between 0.5 and 1.25 inches of rain
have fallen.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 0.5 to 0.75 inches are
expected over the area. This additional rain will result in
minor flooding. Water will generally flow toward San Felipe
Pueblo.

San Felipe Pueblo, Algodones and Placitas.
- This includes the following highways...

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Arroyos, streams, and normally dry rivers can become raging killer
currents in a matter of minutes. Water in arroyos can travel many
miles and take hours to reach your location from upstream rain areas.</instruction>
