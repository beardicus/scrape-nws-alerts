<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 24 at 1:24PM MDT until August 24 at 6:45PM MDT by NWS Albuquerque</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 430 PM MDT THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Arroyo and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of central New Mexico, including southeast
Bernalillo County.
* WHEN...Until 430 PM MDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
Some low-water crossings may become impassable. Ponding of water
in urban or other areas is occurring or is imminent.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 123 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms just west of Ponderosa and Escabosa. This will
cause arroyo and small stream flooding. Between 0.75 and 1.25
inches of rain have fallen in the last hour.
- Additional rainfall amounts up to 1 inch are expected over
the area. This additional rain will result in minor flooding.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
mainly rural areas of Bernalillo County</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Arroyos, streams, and normally dry rivers can become raging killer
currents in a matter of minutes. Water in arroyos can travel many
miles and take hours to reach your location from upstream rain areas.</instruction>
