<description>...The National Weather Service in Midland/Odessa TX has issued a
Flood Warning for the following rivers in Texas...
Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch affecting Brewster County.
.Recent heavy rains upstream and flows out of Old Mexico from the
Rio Conchos basin have resulted in increased flows. Additional
rainfall over the next few days could result in additional rises
and/or flooding.
For the Rio Grande...including Johnson Ranch...Minor flooding is
forecast.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM THIS EVENING TO EARLY FRIDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch.
* WHEN...From this evening to early Friday morning.
* IMPACTS...At 12.0 feet (3.7 meters), the river reaches bankfull,
minor lowland flooding occurs, and no significant damage is
expected.
At 15.0 feet (4.6 meters), flood stage is reached.  Moderate
lowland flooding begins.  Roads that lead to Cottonwood Campground
and River Road may flood.  Stages are practically synonymous with
the gage at Cottonwood Campground at Castolon (CSTT2), and
therefore represent the reach from Santa Elena Canyon through
Cottonwood Campground, where damage may occur.  Cattle also graze
in the lowlands, and may be threatened.
