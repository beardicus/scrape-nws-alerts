...AIR QUALITY ALERT FOR ELEVATED OZONE AIR POLLUTION...
The South Coast AQMD has issued an air quality alert in the South
Coast Air Basin and Coachella Valley due to high levels of ozone
(smog). The air quality alert is in effect from Friday Afternoon
until Monday Evening.
Elevated levels of ozone – the predominant summertime pollutant –
are likely to result in poor air quality in the afternoon and early-
evening hours. Ozone air pollution can cause respiratory health
problems...including trouble breathing...asthma attacks...and lung
damage. Children...older adults...and people with asthma or COPD may
be more sensitive to the health effects of ozone.
Air quality can change depending on time of day and weather
conditions. Increased emissions of chemicals and faster ozone
formation rates due to heat...along with low winds and stagnant
weather can cause unusually high and persistent levels of ozone
pollution.
To help minimize ozone air pollution levels:
• Limit the use of gasoline powered lawn and garden equipment until
evening hours
• Conserve electricity and set your air conditioner at a higher
temperature
• Try to delay trips to the gas station and the use of household
chemicals until the evening
Check air quality levels and take appropriate action as needed. When
air quality index (AQI) levels are Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups
(orange)...people with heart or lung disease...pregnant women...
children...and older adults should limit prolonged or heavy outdoor
exertion. When air quality reaches Unhealthy (red) AQI levels...
everyone may experience adverse health effects and sensitive groups
should avoid prolonged time outdoors. At Very Unhealthy (purple) AQI
levels...sensitive groups should avoid all outdoor physical activity
and everyone else should avoid prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion.
