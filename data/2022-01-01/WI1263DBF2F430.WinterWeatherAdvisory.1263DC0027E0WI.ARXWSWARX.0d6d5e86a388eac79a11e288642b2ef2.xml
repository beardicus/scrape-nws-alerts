<description>...Accumulating Snow For Some and Bitterly Cold for All...
.Snowfall totals for the storm moving through southern Wisconsin
and parts of northeast Iowa were lowered slightly again today.
Accumulating snow is still expected with generally 1 to 3 inches
south of Highway 18 in Fayette, Clayton, and Grant counties. The
snow amounts can easily vary by an inch or two should the snow
take longer to reach the ground or if a band stays over an area
longer than expected. The cold temperatures should make the snow
fluffy and the brisk winds will make it more difficult to measure.
The highest totals will be found for those farther south. The
snow will spread in this afternoon and diminish this evening.
Bitterly cold wind chills will overspread the area tonight with
values in the -25 to -35 degree range by Sunday morning.
