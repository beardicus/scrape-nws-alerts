<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued January 01 at 1:16PM HST until January 01 at 4:30PM HST by NWS Honolulu</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Honolulu has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
The island of Oahu in Honolulu County
* Until 430 PM HST.
* At 116 PM HST, radar and automated rain gauges indicated heavy
rain falling over already saturated ground, with rain rates up to
2 inches per hour. As additional heavy rain is approaching from
the south, very high stream levels are likely to rise further. A
landslide has resulted in the closure of the Pali Highway town
bound, and water levels are very high in Kaelepulu canal near
Kailua beach park.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by heavy rain.
SOURCE...Radar and automated gauges.
IMPACT...Flooding in drainages, streams, rivers, roads,
properties, and other low-lying areas. Public road
closures possible in some areas. Landslides are
possible in steep terrain.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
southern and eastern portions of Oahu.
This warning may need to be extended beyond 430 PM HST if flooding
persists.
This Flash Flood Warning replaces the previously issued Flood
Advisory that was in effect for The island of Oahu in Honolulu
County.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR AND GAUGE INDICATED</description>
