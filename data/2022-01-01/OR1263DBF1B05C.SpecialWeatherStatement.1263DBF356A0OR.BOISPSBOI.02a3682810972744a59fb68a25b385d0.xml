<description>...VERY COLD TEMPERATURES THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...THEN WINDY AND
WARMER WITH SNOW AND VALLEY RAIN MOST OF NEXT WEEK...
2022 is beginning as the coldest day in five years in many areas
with nearly all sites zero degrees or below this New Years morning.
Dangerously cold wind chill as lows as -35F will occur in the
Camas Prairie this morning. Very cold weather will continue
tonight through Sunday night under mostly clear skies.
Monday will begin a transition to warmer temperatures, but
also increasing winds. Southwest winds will increase to near
30 mph with gusts as high as 50 mph in southeast Oregon and
southern-most Idaho. This will cause blowing and drifting of
snow already on the ground. Winds will decrease Tuesday.
Snow will begin Monday in eastern Oregon and the west central
Idaho Mountains, and in all areas by Monday evening. Continued
warming will change the snow to rain up to 5000 feet on Tuesday,
in Oregon first (except Baker County), then later in Idaho, and
in Baker County up to 4000 feet. Snow will continue at higher
elevations through most of the coming week, with heavy
accumulations likely in the northern mountains.</description>
