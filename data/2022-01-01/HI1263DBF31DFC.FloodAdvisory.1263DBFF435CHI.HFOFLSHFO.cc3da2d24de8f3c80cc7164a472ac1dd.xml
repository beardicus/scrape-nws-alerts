<headline>Flood Advisory issued January 01 at 10:55AM HST  by NWS Honolulu</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 215 PM HST THIS AFTERNOON FOR
THE ISLAND OF OAHU IN HONOLULU COUNTY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...The island of Oahu in Honolulu County.
* WHEN...Until 215 PM HST.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding on roads, poor drainage areas, and in
streams.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1052 AM HST, radar showed widespread heavy showers moving
north across Oahu. Although showers are moving fairly
quickly, they are producing rainfall rates near 2 inches per
hour over already saturated ground. Water levels in Waiahole
and Waikane streams are rising, potentially leading to
flooding of portions of Kamehameha Highway.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
the entire island of Oahu.
This advisory may need to be extended beyond 215 PM HST if flooding
persists.</description>
<instruction>Stay away from streams, drainage ditches and low lying areas prone
to flooding.
Rainfall and runoff will also cause hazardous driving conditions due
to ponding, reduced visibility and poor braking action.
A Flood Watch is also in effect.</instruction>
