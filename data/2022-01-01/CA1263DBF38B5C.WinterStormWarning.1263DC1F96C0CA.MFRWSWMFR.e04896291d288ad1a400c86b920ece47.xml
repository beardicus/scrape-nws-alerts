<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM MONDAY TO 4 AM PST
TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected as well as gusty winds and blowing
snow above 6000 foot elevations and along and north of the Mount
Shasta to Medicine Lake highlands. Total snow accumulations of 6
to 12 inches below 3500 foot elevations and in the Tennant and
Highway 97 areas, and 12 to 24 inches above 3500 foot
elevations. Winds gusts 60 to 80 mph above 6000 foot elevations.
* WHERE...All areas including Interstate 5 and Highway 89.
* WHEN...From 4 AM Monday to 4 AM PST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Blowing
snow will significantly reduce visibility to whiteout at higher
elevations and blizzard conditions should be expected on Mount
Shasta and across exposed mountain areas. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute. Very
strong winds could cause extensive tree damage.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The heaviest snowfall is expected to occur
during the day on Monday along the Interstate 5 corridor. Snow
levels are then likely to rise Monday evening through Tuesday
morning to near 4,000 feet with impacts continuing along Highway
89 and at higher elevations. Monday evening through Tuesday
morning southwest flow could result in continued wet snow from
Dunsmuir to McCloud, at times.
