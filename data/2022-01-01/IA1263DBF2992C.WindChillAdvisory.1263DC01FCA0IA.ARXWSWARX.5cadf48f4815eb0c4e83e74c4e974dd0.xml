<headline>Wind Chill Advisory issued January 01 at 11:15AM CST until January 02 at 12:00PM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Accumulating Snow For Some and Bitterly Cold for All...
.Snowfall totals for the storm moving through southern Wisconsin
and parts of northeast Iowa were lowered slightly again this
morning. Accumulating snow is still expected with generally 1 to
3 inches south of Highway 18 in Fayette, Clayton, and Grant
counties. The snow amounts can easily vary by an inch or two
should the snow take longer to reach the ground or if a band stays
over an area longer than expected. The cold temperatures should
make the snow fluffy and the brisk winds will make it more
difficult to measure. The highest totals will be found for those
farther south. The snow will spread in this afternoon and diminish
this evening.
Bitterly cold wind chills will overspread the area tonight with
values in the -25 to -35 degree range by Sunday morning.
