thunderstorms producing moderate to heavy rainfall across the
warned area. Between 2 and 4 inches of rain have fallen.

in the warned area.

Pikeville, Hazard, Prestonsburg, Jackson, Hindman, Estill,
Coal Run Village, Martin, Pippa Passes, Forest Hills,
Wayland, Allen, Buckhorn, Handshoe, Bolyn, Betty, Mid, Bosco,
Garret and Mousie.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
