<headline>Wind Chill Advisory issued January 01 at 12:12PM CST until January 02 at 9:00AM CST by NWS DesMoines</headline>
<description>...Significant Storm With Snow and Dangerous Cold Today and
Tonight...
.Drier air over northern Iowa has eroded some moisture with this
system therefore, snow totals have been lowered along and north of
Interstate 80. The snow will still cause significant travel
difficulties as the combination of strong north winds and fluffy
snow will cause blowing and drifting snow. In addition, bitter
cold temperatures and dangerous wind chills will occur through
most of the event with sub-zero wind chills expected through
tonight when the coldest air of the season moves into Iowa.
Dangerous wind chill values will extend into Sunday morning over
most of the region.
