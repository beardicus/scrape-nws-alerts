<description>...Flood Potential Outlook for Coos, Curry, Douglas, and Josephine
Counties....
Quick rises and a slight potential for flooding on area streams,
creeks, and rivers due to the combination of heavy rainfall and
snow melt in the following counties in Oregon... Coos, Curry,
Douglas, and Josephine.
A series of fronts is likely to bring periods of moderate to heavy
precipitation totaling 2 to 6 inches of water over much of
southwestern Oregon Sunday night, January 2nd into Wednesday,
January 5th. Much of this precipitation is likely to fall as rain
Tuesday into Wednesday as snow levels rise into the 6000 to 7000
foot range.
Currently, Deer Creek near Roseburg, the South Fork of the
Coquille River at both Myrtle Point and Powers, and the Coquille
River at Coquille are forecast to reach action stage, but are not
forecast to reach flood stage during the Monday to Wednesday time
period. Other streams, creeks, and rivers across the area are
likely to rise significantly during the above mentioned time
period and it is still within the realm of possibility that
flooding could occur.
A flood potential outlook is issued when there is the potential
for significant rises or flooding along rivers and streams.
This product will be updated as necessary. Watches and warnings
may be issued by the National Weather Service if it is deemed
necessary.</description>
