Heavy rainfall is also occurring with this storm and may lead to
localized flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flooded

In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to travel across
flooded roads. Find alternate routes. It takes only a few inches of
swiftly flowing water to carry vehicles away.</instruction>
