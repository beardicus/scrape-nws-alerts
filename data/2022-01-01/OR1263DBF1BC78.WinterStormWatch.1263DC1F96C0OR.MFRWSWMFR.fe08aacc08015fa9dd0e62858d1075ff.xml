<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 01 at 3:50AM PST until January 04 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH
LATE MONDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Heavy snow, with accumulations of 8 to 12 inches and
locally higher amounts up to 18 inches possible. Winds could
gust as high as 75 mph.
* WHERE...
- Northern and Eastern Klamath County, from the higher terrain
southeast of Chiloquin north, including portions of highways
97, 58, 31, &amp; 138.
- Western Lake County, mainly the higher terrain from Yamsay
mountain north.
* WHEN...From late Sunday night through late Monday night.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Patchy
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute. Very strong winds could cause extensive tree damage.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...It seems likely that areas around the
southern and northeastern edge of the current watch area will
meet winter weather advisory criteria.
- This could effect a larger area from Sprague River
north &amp; Modoc Point along highway 97 in Kalamth County.
- And a portion of highway 31, northwest of Fort Rock, in
Northwest Lake County.

blankets, food, water, and medications in your vehicle.
* The safest place during a winter storm is indoors.</instruction>
