<description>...Winter Storm Winding Down This Evening Then Dangerous Cold
Overnight...
.Snowfall will continue to wind down across the region this
evening, primarily from northwest to southeast. Areas of southeast
Iowa may continue to see periods of moderate snowfall, but too
will wind down over the next few hours. Travel conditions may
remain relatively poor even after snowfall ends due to this
snowfall easily being blown around and across roadways. Replacing
snowfall, and already in place across much of the state, will be
bitter to dangerous cold and wind chills lasting into Sunday
morning.
...WIND CHILL WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST SUNDAY...
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IS CANCELLED...
* WHAT...Very cold wind chills expected. Wind chills to around 30
to 35 below zero.
* WHERE...Portions of northern and northeast Iowa
* WHEN...Until noon CST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...The cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed
skin in as little as 30 minutes or less. Areas that received
accumulating snowfall may continue to see hazardous travel at
times due to periods of blowing snow.</description>
