<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued March 12 at 6:49AM CDT until March 13 at 1:00AM CDT by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Slick Roads As Snow Continues...
.Precipitation will continue for much of the day with visibilities
reduced to under a mile at times and snow rates exceeding 1/2 inch
per hour. Light freezing drizzle may also be possible as heavier
snowfall exits east this morning. Additional accumulations are
expected this evening, across north-central Wisconsin, with
moderate confidence in exact location of a heavier snow band.
Given the higher amounts clipping Taylor County, have upgraded to
warning for the remaining headline period. Increased snowfall
amounts and rates may just graze northeastern edges of Clark
County as well. Slow down and use extra caution if driving today
and tonight.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM CDT
MONDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation. Overall additional snow
accumulations of 3 to 5 inches with higher amounts possible in
northeastern part of the County. Ice accumulations of a light
glaze possible.
* WHERE...Clark County.
* WHEN...Until 1 AM CDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
