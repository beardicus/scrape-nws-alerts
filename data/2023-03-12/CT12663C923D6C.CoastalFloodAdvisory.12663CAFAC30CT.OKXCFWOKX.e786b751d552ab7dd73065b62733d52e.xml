<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued March 12 at 2:11PM EDT until March 14 at 7:00AM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT LATE TONIGHT...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 2 AM TO 7 AM EDT
TUESDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, Up to 1 1/2 foot of
inundation above ground level expected in vulnerable areas near
the waterfront and shoreline. For the Coastal Flood Statement,
up to 1/2 foot of inundation above ground level expected in
vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...In Connecticut, Southern Fairfield County. In New
York, Southern Westchester County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 2 AM to 7 AM EDT
Tuesday. For the Coastal Flood Statement, late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding is expected in the most vulnerable
locations near the waterfront and shoreline. Expect up to 1 1/2
feet of inundation above ground level in low lying, vulnerable
areas, particularly for the late Monday Night/early Tuesday AM
high tide. Some roads and low lying property including parking
lots, parks, lawns and homes/businesses with basements near the
waterfront will experience shallow flooding.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...1 to 3 ft breaking waves will result in
beach erosion and flooding. Waves splashing over bulkheads and
seawalls may locally exacerbate flooding of vulnerable shoreline
roadways and structures. In addition, heavy rain during the
times of high tide will likely exacerbate street flooding in
coastal communities.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
