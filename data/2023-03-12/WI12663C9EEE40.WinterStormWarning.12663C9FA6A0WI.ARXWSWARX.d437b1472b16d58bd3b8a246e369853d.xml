<description>...Band of Moderate Snow over Central Wisconsin...
.The heaviest snow set up just east of Taylor county, however we
continue to see a very narrow band of moderate snow pivot through
Clark County this evening. The visibilities have mostly been 3/4
of a mile to 3 miles, however visibilities could briefly drop
to 1/2 mile with any snow increases. Some locations will continue
to see an inch or two of snow this evening as this band drops
south and pulls eastward. Northeast winds will increase later
this evening leading to some blowing and drifting of snow over
roads with continued slick conditions.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM CDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Snow. Additional snow accumulations up to one or two
inches.
* WHERE...Taylor County.
* WHEN...Until 1 AM CDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Some blowing and
drifting of snow with increasing northeast winds.</description>
