<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued March 12 at 4:03AM EDT until March 15 at 2:00PM EDT by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...SIGNIFICANT SNOWSTORM POSSIBLE MONDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...
.Rapidly strengthening low pressure will approach southern New
England Monday night, with snow overspreading the area through
Tuesday morning. Greatest snowfall will likely fall at higher
terrain across the Monadnocks, Sunapee, the Ossippees, and White
Mountains. At lower elevations, snow may be heavy and wet, resulting
in possible snow load impacts and possible power outages. Gusty
northeast to north winds Tuesday could accentuate power outage risk.
...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 6 to 12
inches possible, with locally higher amounts possible. Northeast
winds could gust as high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of south central, southwest, and western Maine.
Portions of central and southern New Hampshire.
* WHEN...From late Monday night through Wednesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will
likely become slick and hazardous. The strong winds and weight of
snow on tree limbs may down power lines and could cause sporadic
power outages. Periods of moderate and heavy snow will combine
with low visibility to create dangerous driving conditions. The
hazardous conditions could impact the Tuesday morning and evening
commutes. Gusty winds could bring down tree branches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Precipitation may start as rain across
southeastern New Hampshire and the southern coast of Maine before
changing over to snow Tuesday morning.</description>
<instruction>Monitor the latest forecasts for updates on this situation.
Persons should delay all travel if possible. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution and be prepared for sudden
changes in visibility. Leave plenty of room between you and the
motorist ahead of you, and allow extra time to reach your
destination. Avoid sudden braking or acceleration, and be especially
cautious on hills or when making turns. Make sure your car is
winterized and in good working order.</instruction>
