<headline>High Wind Watch issued March 12 at 1:46PM PDT until March 14 at 11:00PM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH
TUESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...South winds 20 to 30 mph with gusts up to 55 mph
possible. Wind prone areas along US-395 from Susanville to
Washoe Valley to Crowley Lake and along US-95 near Walker Lake
could see gusts up to 65 mph.
* WHERE...Northern Washoe County, Mineral and Southern Lyon
Counties, Surprise Valley California, Greater Reno-Carson City-
Minden Area and Western Nevada Basin and Range including
Pyramid Lake.
* WHEN...From late Monday night through Tuesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Strong winds could blow down trees and power lines.
Power outages are possible. Travel could be difficult,
especially for high profile vehicles.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...There will also be heavy rain and high
elevation snow throughout the region. This may act to weaken
winds speeds at times, before stronger wind gusts come seemingly
out of nowhere.</description>
<instruction>Now is the time to secure loose outdoor items such as patio
furniture, and trash cans before winds increase which could blow
these items away. The best thing to do is prepare ahead of time by
making sure you have extra food and water on hand, flashlights
with spare batteries and/or candles in the event of a power
outage.</instruction>
