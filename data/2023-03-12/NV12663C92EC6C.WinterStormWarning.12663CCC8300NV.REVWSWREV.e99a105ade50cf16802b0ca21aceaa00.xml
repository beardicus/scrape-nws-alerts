<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 12 at 3:59PM PDT until March 15 at 5:00PM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM PDT
WEDNESDAY...
* CHANGES...Lesser snow amounts through Monday. Faster drop in
snow levels late Tuesday into Wednesday. Included possible
lightning during heavier snow bands.
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Additional snow accumulations
through Monday: 2 to 8 inches below 7000 feet at lake level and
around Truckee, with 1 to 2 feet above 7000 feet. For Tuesday
into Wednesday: 4 to 12 inches at lake level and Truckee, with 1
to 3 feet above 7000 feet. Sierra ridge gusts above 100 mph and
wave heights 2 to 5 feet on Lake Tahoe by Monday night and
Tuesday.
* WHERE...Greater Lake Tahoe Area.
* WHEN...Until 5 PM PDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible at
times. Snow loading on structures will increase due to the
additional rain and snow being absorbed into the deep
snowpack, along with higher risks for dangerous roofalanches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow levels will vary between 6000 and 6500
feet through Monday evening, then rise between 7000 and 7500
feet Tuesday morning, before falling during the afternoon to
below 6000 feet by late Tuesday night. While short bursts of
heavy convective snow are expected through this evening, the
heaviest overall snowfall rates are expected on Tuesday.
Isolated lightning is also possible during heavier snow.</description>
