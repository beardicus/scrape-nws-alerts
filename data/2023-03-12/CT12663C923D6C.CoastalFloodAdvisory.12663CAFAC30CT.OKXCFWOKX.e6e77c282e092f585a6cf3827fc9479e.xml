<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued March 12 at 2:11PM EDT until March 14 at 7:00AM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 2 AM TO 7 AM EDT
TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Up to 1 1/2 foot of inundation above ground level
expected in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...In Connecticut, Southern New Haven County. In New
York, Bronx, Northwest Suffolk, Northern Queens and Northern
Nassau Counties.
* WHEN...From 2 AM to 7 AM EDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding is expected in the most vulnerable
locations near the waterfront and shoreline. Expect up to 1 1/2
feet of inundation above ground level in low lying, vulnerable
areas with the late Monday Night/early Tuesday AM high tide.
Some roads and low lying property including parking lots, parks,
lawns and homes/businesses with basements near the waterfront
will experience shallow flooding.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...1 to 3 ft breaking waves will result in
beach erosion and flooding, particularly Orient Point. Waves
splashing over bulkheads and seawalls may locally exacerbate
flooding of vulnerable shoreline roadways and structures. In
addition, heavy rain during the times of high tide will likely
exacerbate street flooding in coastal communities.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
