<instruction>An Ice Storm Storm Warning means severe winter weather conditions
are expected or occurring. Significant amounts of ice
accumulations will make travel dangerous or impossible. Travel is
strongly discouraged. Commerce will likely be severely impacted.
If you must travel, keep a flashlight, food, and water in your
vehicle in case of an emergency. Ice accumulations and winds will
likely lead to snapped power lines and falling tree branches that
add to the danger. Prepare for possible power outages.
A Winter Weather Advisory means that periods of snow, sleet, or
freezing rain will cause travel difficulties. Be prepared for
slippery roads and limited visibilities, and use caution while
driving.
Please report snow and ice accumulations by calling the National
Weather Service toll free at...1...800...2 6 7...8 1 0 1. Leave a
message with your observation and the specific location where it
occurred. You can also post your report to National Weather
Service Greenville Spartanburg Facebook or tweet your report
using hashtag nwsgsp.
Stay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio or your favorite source of
weather information for the latest updates. Additional details
