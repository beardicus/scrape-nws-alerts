<description>...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT NOW IN EFFECT FROM 11 PM EDT THIS
EVENING THROUGH LATE TONIGHT...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT MONDAY NIGHT TO
7 AM EDT TUESDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to 1 1/2 foot of
inundation above ground level expected in vulnerable areas near

up to 1/2 foot of inundation above ground level expected in
vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...Southwest Suffolk County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from midnight Monday
night to 7 AM EDT Tuesday. For the Coastal Flood Statement,
from 11 PM EDT this evening through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding is expected in the most vulnerable
locations near the waterfront and shoreline. Expect up to 1 1/2
feet of inundation above ground level in low lying, vulnerable
areas, particularly for the late Monday Night/early Tuesday AM
high tide. Some roads and low lying property including parking
lots, parks, lawns and homes/businesses with basements near the
waterfront will experience shallow flooding.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...4 to 7 ft breaking waves will result in
beach erosion and flooding along the oceanfront during the times
of high tide with only minor erosion to dune structures. In
addition, heavy rain during the times of high tide will likely
exacerbate street flooding in coastal communities.</description>

closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
