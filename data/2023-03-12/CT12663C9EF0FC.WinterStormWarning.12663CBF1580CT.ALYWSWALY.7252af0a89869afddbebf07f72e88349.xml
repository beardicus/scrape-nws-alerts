<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 5 PM MONDAY TO
8 AM EDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy wet snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 12
to 18 inches with greater amounts up to 20 inches in the higher
terrain areas of the southern Greens and Berkshires. Winds
gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Southern Vermont, western Massachusetts, northern
Litchfield Hills and the northern and central Taconics in
eastern New York.
* WHEN...From 5 PM Monday to 8 AM EDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be very difficult to impossible. This
includes the Tuesday morning and evening commute. The weight of
the heavy wet snow on tree branches will likely result in power
outages. Snowfall rates will reach 1 to 2 inches per hour at
times with locally higher rates possible depending on where the
heaviest snow bands develop. Strong winds will also result in
very low visibility, especially Tuesday into Tuesday night.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...This will be a long duration and high-
impact snow event. Prepare now for this upcoming winter storm.</description>
