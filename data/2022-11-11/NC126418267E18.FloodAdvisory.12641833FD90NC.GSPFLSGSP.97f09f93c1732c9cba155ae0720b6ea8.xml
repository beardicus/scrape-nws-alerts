<headline>Flood Advisory issued November 11 at 3:54PM EST  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Minor flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...Central Henderson County, North Carolina.
* WHEN...Until 800 PM EST.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance to Minor flooding of low-lying areas including
farmland, parks, greenways, nurseries, low-water crossings, golf
courses, and low-lying roadways adjacent to streams.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 342 PM EST, Storm-total rainfall of 2-4&quot; within the Mud
Creek watershed of central Henderson County resulted in
significant rises along Mud Creek and its tributaries.  Heavy
rainfall has ended across the area and the floodwave is
moving through the Hendersonville area.  Mud Creek has
crested at 9.54 feet between 2 and 3 pm at Erkwood Dr and
will crest downstream over the next couple of hours.
However, Mud Creek remains above Minor Flood Stage and
continues to impact farmland, nurseries, and golf courses
near Crail Farm Rd, Middleton Rd, Erkwood Dr, and Kanuga Rd
as well as the Oklawaha Greenway.  It will take several more
hours for Mud Creek to recede below bankfull or
Action/Advisory Stage.  Therefore, flooding impacts will
continue but gradually improve into the evening hours.  The
Flood Advisory will remain in effect until the stream falls
below Action/Advisory Stage.
- Some locations that may continue to experience flooding
include...
Hendersonville, Flat Rock, Mountain Home, Laurel Park, Dupont
State Forest, Valley Hill, East Flat Rock, Crab Creek and
Dana.
