<headline>Flood Advisory issued November 11 at 5:00PM EST until November 11 at 6:00PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 1045 PM EST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Central McDowell County, North Carolina
* WHEN...Until 1045 PM EST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance to Minor flooding of low-lying areas adjacent
to streams including campgrounds, greenways, parks, boat-access
areas, farmland, low-water crossings, and low-lying secondary
roads.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 442 PM EST, Heavy rainfall has departed the area and only
light rainfall will impact the area through the remainder of
the evening.  However, storm-total rainfall of 4-6&quot;, with
isolated totals of 6-8&quot;, were observed along the Blue Ridge
Escarpment within the headwaters of the Catawba River since
early Friday morning.  This has caused significant flows down
the several tributaries feeding the upper Catawba River,
including Mill Creek near Old Fort, Buck Creek near Lake
Tahoma, and Toms Creek near Woodlawn.
While the floodwave has moved through these tributaries, it
is now moving through the upper Catawba River.  The
streamgauges along the Catawba River near Pleasant Gardens
and Marion indicate the Catawba River is out of its banks and
causing nuisance to Minor Flooding of adjacent low-lying
areas including the Tom Johnson Campground, Greenlee Park,
the Joseph McDowell Historical Greenway, and Riverbreeze
Campground.
The Catawba River at Resistoflex Road near Pleasant Gardens
crested at 9.66 feet at 4pm EST and is now slowly falling.
Action/Advisory Stage for nuisance flooding of adjacent low-
lying areas is 9.0 feet.  Just downstream at N Main Street in
Marion, the Catawba River is nearing crest around 22 feet or
1 foot above Action/Advisory Stage.  The Catawba River will
continue to crest over the next couple of hours then begin a
gradual recession below Action Stage later this evening.
Therefore, nuisance to Minor flooding will continue for a few
more hours and a Flood Advisory has been issued for the reach
from Old Fort to Lake James until floodwaters have fully
receded.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Marion, Old Fort, and Pleasant Gardens.

<instruction>Flooding is occurring and will continue to impact recreational areas
as well as some low-water crossings. Please avoid all streams and
seek higher ground away from adjacent low-lying areas. Turn around,
don`t drown.</instruction>
