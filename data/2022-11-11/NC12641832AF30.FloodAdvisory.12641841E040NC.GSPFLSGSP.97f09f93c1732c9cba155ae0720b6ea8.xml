<headline>Flood Advisory issued November 11 at 7:44PM EST until November 12 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM EST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Nuisance flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...Central Henderson County, North Carolina
* WHEN...Until 100 AM EST.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas including farmland,
parks, greenways, nurseries, low-water crossings, golf courses,
and low-lying roadways adjacent to streams.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 739 PM EST, Storm-total rainfall of 2-4&quot; within the Mud
Creek watershed of central Henderson County resulted in
significant rises along Mud Creek and its tributaries.  Heavy
rainfall ended across the area several hours ago and the
floodwave is moving past the Hendersonville area.  Mud Creek
crested at 9.54 feet between 2 and 3 pm at Erkwood Dr and
will crest downstream at N Main St over the next couple of
hours.
Mud Creek remains above Action/Advisory Stage and continues
to impact farmland, nurseries, and golf courses near Crail
Farm Rd, Middleton Rd, Erkwood Dr, and Kanuga Rd as well as
the Oklawaha Greenway.  It will take several more hours for
Mud Creek to recede below bankfull or Action/Advisory Stage.
Flooding impacts will continue but gradually improve into the
early overnight hours.  The Flood Advisory will remain in
effect until the stream falls below Action/Advisory Stage.
- Some locations that may continue to experience flooding
include...
Hendersonville and Mountain Home.
