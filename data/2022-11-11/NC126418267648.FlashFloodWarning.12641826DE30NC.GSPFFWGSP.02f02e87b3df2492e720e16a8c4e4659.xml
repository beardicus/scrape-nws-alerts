<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued November 11 at 3:34PM EST until November 11 at 6:00PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has extended
the
* Flash Flood Warning for...
Avery County in western North Carolina...
Northwestern Burke County in western North Carolina...
Northwestern Caldwell County in western North Carolina...
Northeastern McDowell County in western North Carolina...
Southeastern Mitchell County in western North Carolina...
* Until 600 PM EST.
* At 334 PM EST, Doppler radar indicates that heavy rainfall has
departed the area and no additional heavy rainfall is expected
tonight.  Storm-total rainfall of 3-5&quot; over the past 12-15 hours,
with isolated totals exceeding 6&quot;, have been reported across the
area from North Cove to Spruce Pine to Jonas Ridge, Edgemont and
Sugar Mountain.  This has caused excessive runoff and significant
rises on area streams, with several streams exceeding bankfull and
flooding adjacent low-lying areas.
A few road closures have been reported due to stream flooding
across the warned area, including near Banner Elk, Spruce Pine,
and Crossnore. Numerous low-water crossings were likely flooded
during this event. Small stream flooding required the earlier
evacuation of residents along Brushy Creek west of Spruce Pine.
Additional flooding along the Elk River near Banner Elk and the
North Toe River near Newland is likely and may continue for
another couple of hours.  Some of this flooding may impact a few
homes and businesses adjacent to both streams through the
remainder of the afternoon.
While many smaller streams have likely crested and receded back
below critical bankfull levels, larger streams may not crest for
another few hours.  As a result, flooding of these larger streams,
including the Johns River near Collettsville and Chesterfield, as
well as the Linville River above Lake James, will continue into
the early evening hours.  Therefore, the Flash Flood Warning will
remain in place for another hour or two to allow larger streams to
crest and begin to recede.  Once the floodwave has passed, the
Warning may be replaced by a Flood Advisory for residual flood
concerns.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by heavy rain.
SOURCE...Radar and automated gauges.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of streams impacting numerous low-water
crossings, secondary roads, and low-lying areas
adjacent to streams including parks, greenways,
farmland, and boat-access areas, is ongoing.
* Some locations that may continue to experience flash flooding
include...
Spruce Pine, Newland, Banner Elk, Bakersville, B Crossnore, Sugar
Mountain, Linville Falls, Jonas Ridge, Pineola, Linville, Ashford,
Altamont and Ingalls.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR AND GAUGE INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Heavy rain is increasing the risk of landslides, especially in areas
where slides have occurred in the past. Be especially alert if you
are near a stream, especially at the base of a mountain or in a
cove. Watch for loose-moving soil and rocks or a sudden increase in
streamflow. Leave the area quickly if this is observed. When driving
along roads where the terrain is steep or rocky, watch and listen
for falling rocks, mud, trees and other debris.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.</instruction>
