<headline>Flood Advisory issued November 11 at 5:23PM EST until November 12 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 815 PM EST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Northeastern Henderson County and western Rutherford
County in North Carolina.
* WHEN...Until 815 PM EST.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance to Minor flooding of low-lying areas adjacent
to streams including campgrounds, greenways, parks, boat-access
areas, farmland, low-water crossings, and low-lying secondary
roads.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 514 PM EST, Heavy rainfall has departed the area and only
light rainfall will impact the Chimney Rock and Lake Lure
area through the remainder of the evening.  However, storm-
total rainfall of 3-4&quot; occurred along the headwaters of the
Broad River from Gerton to Chimney Rock to Lake Lure since
early Friday morning, causing significant rises along the
Broad/Rocky Broad River and associated tributaries.  While
the flash flood threat has ended, the Broad River near Lake
Lure continues to run above bankfull in some areas, causing
nuisance flooding of adjacent low-lying areas.  Therefore, a
Flood Advisory has been issued from Bat Cave to
Lake Lure to Green Hill and will remain in effect until
floodwaters have receded.
- Some locations that may continue to experience flooding
include...
Chimney Rock Village, Bat Cave, and areas downstream of Lake
Lure.
