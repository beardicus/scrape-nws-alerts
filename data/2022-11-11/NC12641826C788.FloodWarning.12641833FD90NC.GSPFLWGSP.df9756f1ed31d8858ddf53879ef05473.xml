<headline>Flood Warning issued November 11 at 5:42PM EST  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 530 AM EST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of western North Carolina, including the
following counties, Burke and Caldwell.
* WHEN...Until 530 AM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams is
ongoing, including farmland, nurseries, campgrounds, boat-access
areas, low-water crossings, and low-lying secondary roadways.
Inundation up to several feet deep is possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 527 PM EST, Heavy rainfall has ended and only light
rainfall is expected through the remainder of tonight.
However, storm-total rainfall of 4-7&quot; in the headwaters of
the Johns River watershed, including along Wilson Creek and
Mulberry Creek, has caused significant rises and Minor
flooding from Collettsville to Adako to Chesterfield.
The Johns River at Corpening Bridge Rd is currently at 14.01
feet and continues a steady rise.  Minor Flood Stage is 12
feet.  The Johns River is expected to continue to rise over
the next 2-4 hours, and should crest between 15-16 feet later
tonight.  At these levels, extensive flooding within the
Johns River valley below Collettsville is ongoing, impacting
farmland, nurseries, outbuildings, boat-access areas, low-
water crossings and adjacent roads.  Inundation of 2-4` is
likely in some locations adjacent to the river.  Floodwaters
are likely impacting Corpening Bridge Rd, Playmore Beach Rd,
Old Johns River Rd, Johns River Rd, and Johns River Loop.
It will take several more hours for the Johns River to fall
back below Minor Flood Stage and may not fall below
Action/Advisory (bankfull) Stage until later Saturday
morning.  This Flood Warning will therefore remain in effect
through the overnight hours.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Adako, Chesterfield, and Collettsville.
