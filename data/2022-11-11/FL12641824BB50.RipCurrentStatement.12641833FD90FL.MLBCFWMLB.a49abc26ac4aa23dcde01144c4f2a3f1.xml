* IMPACTS...Coastal roads may be closed. Low lying property

Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach
erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>Coastal flooding is occurring or imminent. Coastal residents in
the warned area should be alert for rising water, and take
appropriate action to protect life and property. If travel is
required, do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth.
High surf will produce localized beach erosion and dangerous
swimming conditions. Swimmers should remain out of the water due
to large breaking waves and dangerous surf conditions. There may
also be large pieces debris in the surf which could injure you.
Again, stay out of the water today!
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as jetties and
piers.</instruction>
