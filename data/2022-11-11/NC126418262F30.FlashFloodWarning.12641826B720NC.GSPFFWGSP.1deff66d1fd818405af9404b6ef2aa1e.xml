<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued November 11 at 1:52PM EST until November 11 at 5:00PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has extended
the
* Flash Flood Warning for...
Southeastern Buncombe County in western North Carolina...
Eastern Henderson County in western North Carolina...
Southwestern McDowell County in western North Carolina...
Western Polk County in western North Carolina...
Northwestern Rutherford County in western North Carolina...
* Until 500 PM EST.
* At 152 PM EST, Doppler radar indicates the heaviest rainfall has
shifted well to the north and east of the Blue Ridge Escarpment
between Tryon and Lake Tahoma.  The worst of the rainfall is over
for this event and no additional significant rainfall is expected
through this evening.
However, storm-total rainfall of 3-6&quot; has caused numerous streams
across the area from Hendersonville, to Black Mountain, to Chimney
Rock to rise above bankfull and continue to flood adjacent low
lying areas.  Isolated road closures have been reported within the
Warning area.  Additional areas of Minor flooding are likely to
develop as streams continue to rise.  It will take a few more
hours for streams to crest and begin to recede.  Therefore, the
Flash Flood Warning will continue through the afternoon hours.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Heavy rain producing
flash flooding.
SOURCE...Radar and automated gauges.
IMPACT...Isolated, life-threatening flash flooding of creeks
and streams is likely, impacting low-water crossings,
roadways adjacent to streams, and some structures
within the adjacent flood plain.  Significant flooding
of flood-prone areas including parks, greenways,
farmland, and boat access areas is ongoing.
* Some locations that may continue to experience flash flooding
include...
Hendersonville, Columbus, Flat Rock, Tryon, Lake Lure, Old Fort,
Saluda, Chimney Rock Village, Bat Cave, Montreat, Gerton,
Edneyville, Lake Adger, Dana, Pleasant Gardens, East Flat Rock and
Busick.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR AND GAUGE INDICATED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>Heavy rain is increasing the risk of landslides, especially in areas
where slides have occurred in the past. Be especially alert if you
are near a stream, especially at the base of a mountain or in a
cove. Watch for loose-moving soil and rocks or a sudden increase in
streamflow. Leave the area quickly if this is observed. When driving
along roads where the terrain is steep or rocky, watch and listen
for falling rocks, mud, trees and other debris.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.</instruction>
