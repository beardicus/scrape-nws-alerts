<description>...Patchy Dense Fog expected across portions of the Tennessee Valley
through early Saturday morning...
Patchy Dense Fog has developed across portions of northeast Alabama
and southern Middle Tennessee this evening, with visibility
reductions as low as one-quarter of a mile observed in a few
locations. The fog will persist for the remainder of the evening and
into the early morning hours on Saturday, but will begin to mix out
close to sunrise as a strong cold front enters the region from the
northwest.
Motorists are urged to drive with extreme caution, as visibilities
will vary significantly given the patchy nature of the fog. Use low
beams, reduce driving speed, and allow for plenty of room between you
and other cars.</description>
