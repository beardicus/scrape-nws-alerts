<description>.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 431 AM CST Tue Feb 8 2022
Very high to extreme fire weather conditions will overspread areas
along and west of I-29 later this morning into the afternoon
hours, with relative humidity values dropping down into the mid
20s to lower 30s. While these RH values are borderline for normal
RFW criteria, given the expected gusts of 40 to 50 mph and our dry
fuels dangerous fire weather conditions are expected.
Fire weather conditions should improve as we head towards sunset as
the boundary layer stabilizes and a temperature inversion sets up.
This will allow for RH`s to improve and wind gusts to subside.
People are urged to exercise extreme care with respect to outdoor
activities that could cause grass fires. Avoid equipment that can
cause sparks near dry grass or brush. Do not toss cigarettes on
the ground. Report new fires quickly to the nearest fire
department or law enforcement office.
...EXTREME FIRE DANGER...
The Grassland Fire Danger Index will reach the extreme category
this afternoon. Extreme weather conditions and very low
moisture content of grasses, and other dry organic material
on the ground, indicate that critical burning conditions exist.
All fires have the potential to become large and spread quickly,
becoming erratic with extreme behavioral characteristics.
No outdoor burning should take place.
OUTLOOK FOR WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...The Grassland Fire Danger Index
will reach the high category.
The grassland fire danger product reflects fire danger for native
grasses. It is not intended for cured agricultural crops, nor
will it reflect conditions in road ditches which have been mowed.</description>
