        <headline>Flood Warning issued June 13 at 10:20PM EDT until June 14 at 4:15AM EDT by NWS Blacksburg VA</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...Small stream flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
expected.

* WHERE...A portion of west central Virginia, including the
following county, Rockbridge.

* WHEN...Until 415 AM EDT.

* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring. Streams
continue to rise due to excess runoff from earlier rainfall.
Low-water crossings are inundated with water and may not be
passable. It will take several hours for all the water from these
storms to work through local drainage systems in urban areas.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1016 PM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated heavy rain due to thunderstorms. Flooding is
ongoing or expected to begin shortly in the warned area.
Between 4 and 6 inches of rain have fallen.
- This includes the following streams and drainages...
Kerrs Creek, Cold Run, Walters Creek, Maury River, Alone Mill
Creek and Gilmer Creek. Additional rainfall amounts up to 0.5
inches are possible in the warned area. Kerr Creek is
currently rising rapidly, and may reach major flood stage
before cresting this evening. This may lead to water in some
structures along Kerr Creek.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Lexington and Rockbridge Baths.

        <instruction>Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.

Move to higher ground now. Act quickly to protect your life.

Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.

Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.

In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.

When it is safe to do so, please send your reports of flooding,
including mudslides or flooded roads, to the National Weather
Service by calling toll free at 1...8 6 6...2 1 5...4 3 2 4. Reports
and pictures can also be shared on the National Weather Service
Blacksburg Facebook page and on Twitter.</instruction>
