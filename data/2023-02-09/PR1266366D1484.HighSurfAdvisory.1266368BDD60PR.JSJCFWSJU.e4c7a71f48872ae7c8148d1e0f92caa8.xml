<headline>High Surf Advisory issued February 09 at 4:25AM AST until February 11 at 6:00AM AST by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM THIS EVENING TO 6 AM
AST SATURDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Breaking waves around 10 feet.
* WHERE...Beaches of Vieques.
* WHEN...High Surf Advisory from 6 PM this evening to 6 AM AST
Saturday. High Risk of Rip Currents in effect through Saturday
afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous breaking waves. Dangerous swimming
conditions and localized beach erosion. Breaking waves can
knock people and pets off rocks and jetties, which could
result in significant injury or drowning. Rip currents can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper
waters.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.</instruction>
