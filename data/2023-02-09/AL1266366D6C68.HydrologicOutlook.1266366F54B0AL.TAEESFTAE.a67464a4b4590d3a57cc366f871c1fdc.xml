<description>...MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF HEAVY RAIN EXPECTED FROM FRIDAY THROUGH
SATURDAY NIGHT...
...RIVER FLOODING IS A GROWING CONCERN THIS WEEKEND...
...ISOLATED FLASH FLOODING POSSIBLE...
.Flood Potential and Impacts...
Forecast rainfall amounts for Friday and Saturday have increased
from earlier forecasts. There is growing concern for riverine
flooding, with isolated flash flooding possible.
Multiple rounds of heavy rain are expected on Friday and Saturday,
due to a slow-moving cold front on Friday, then an uncommonly far
south upper low passing by on Saturday.
These rounds of heavy rain are now forecast to add up to 2 to 4
inches on a widespread basis. Localized totals of 6 or more inches
are possible, especially in places where thunderstorms repeatedly
train over the same areas, or any areas where heavy rain bands
form a pivot point.
Rises are expected on all area rivers. Broadly speaking, river
basins picking up 4 inches of rain can expect minor flooding.
Basins picking up 6 inches of rain could experience moderate
flooding.
It is still too early to pinpoint exactly which river basins will
receive the heaviest rain totals. However, river systems with
headwaters in Georgia and Alabama have the greater odds of
getting the heavier rain. Rivers of greater concern for flooding
include the Kinchafoonee, Muckalee, Ochlockonee, Withlacoochee,
Choctawhatchee, Pea, Shoal, and the combined Chattahoochee /
Flint / Apalachicola River systems. Other river systems cannot be
ruled out for flooding.
.Preparedness Actions...
Should models continue to indicate an increased likelihood of a heavy
rainfall, a flood watch may be issued for a portion of our area
as soon as Friday morning.
People living near small streams and area rivers should be alert
to rapid rises in water level and be prepared to take action if
warnings are issued. Residents living in areas vulnerable to
flash flooding should consider evaluating their flood risk and be
prepared to take action to protect themselves and property from
flood damage.
