<description>...MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF HEAVY RAIN EXPECTED FROM FRIDAY THROUGH
SATURDAY NIGHT...
...MINOR TO MODERATE RIVER FLOODING POSSIBLE LATE THIS WEEKEND AND
EARLY NEXT WEEK...
...ISOLATED FLASH FLOODING POSSIBLE...
.Flood Potential and Impacts...
Forecast rainfall amounts continue to increase, especially across
the I-75 corridor in South Central Georgia. This continues to
raise the potential for riverine and flash flooding across South
Georgia, Southeast Alabama, and North Florida.
Multiple rounds of heavy rain are expected on Friday and
Saturday, due to a slow-moving cold front on Friday, then an
additional storm system passing by on Saturday.
These rounds of heavy rain are now forecast to add up to 3 to 4
inches over a widespread portion of the region. Localized totals
of 6 to 8 inches are possible, especially in places where
thunderstorms repeatedly train over the same areas like along
Interstate 75 in South Georgia and adjacent areas of the Florida
Big Bend.
Rises are expected on all area rivers. Broadly speaking, river
basins picking up 4 inches of rain can expect minor flooding.
Basins picking up 6 inches of rain could experience moderate
flooding. Riverine flooding could begin as soon as Saturday night
into Sunday morning.
Based on the latest forecast, river systems with headwaters in
Georgia and Alabama have the greatest potential of getting the
heaviest rain. Thus, rivers of greater concern for flooding
include the Kinchafoonee, Muckalee, Ochlockonee, Withlacoochee,
Choctawhatchee, Pea, Shoal, and the combined Chattahoochee / Flint
/ Apalachicola River systems.
Looking ahead, another storm system could affect the region late
next week. Though it is too early to speculate on rainfall
amounts, the region will be vulnerable to flooding following this
weekend`s heavy rainfall.
.Preparedness Actions...
With the models continuing to show an increased likelihood of a
heavy rainfall event, a flood watch may be issued for a portion
of our area as soon as Friday morning.
People living near small streams and area rivers should be alert
to rapid rises in water level and be prepared to take action if
warnings are issued. Residents living in areas vulnerable to
flash flooding should consider evaluating their flood risk and be
prepared to take action to protect themselves and property from
flood damage.
