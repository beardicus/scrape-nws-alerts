<headline>Snow Squall Warning issued February 09 at 1:57AM MST until February 09 at 2:45AM MST by NWS Pueblo</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Pueblo has issued a
* Snow Squall Warning for...
Southeastern Fremont County in central Colorado...
Western Pueblo County in southeastern Colorado...
* Until 245 AM MST.
* At 154 AM MST, a dangerous snow squall was located near Pueblo
Reservoir, or 12 miles west of Pueblo, moving southeast at 35 mph.
HAZARD...Whiteout conditions with near zero visibility associated
with intense bursts of heavy snow and gusty winds leading
to blowing snow. Wind gusts greater than 50 mph could
knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured objects.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Travel will become difficult and potentially dangerous
within minutes.
Very intense snowfall was likely occurring in far eastern Fremont
county and far western Pueblo county. This activity was dropping
southeast. The I-25 corridor from Pueblo to the Huerfano county
lines will be impacted by this heavy snow.
Locations impacted include...
Pueblo, Pueblo Reservoir, Salt Creek, Blende, Penrose, Pueblo West
and Colorado City.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.
Serious injuries and deaths may result from people exiting their
vehicles during a snow squall. Drivers may not be able to see you or
stop! If you have been involved in an accident or pulled to the side
of the roadway, quickly exit your vehicle and move as far away from
the roadway as possible ONLY when it is safe to do so. Do not stand
along or near the roadway, since approaching vehicles may be unable
to maintain control.
