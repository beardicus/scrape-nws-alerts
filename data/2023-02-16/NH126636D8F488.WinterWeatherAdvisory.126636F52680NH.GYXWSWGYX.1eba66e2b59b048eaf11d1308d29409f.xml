It is likely that this advisory will have to be expanded farther
south for Friday as the cold air surges farther southward.

between 2 and 6 inches, sleet accumulations around one half of an

* WHERE...Portions of south central, west central, and western
Maine. Portions of northern New Hampshire.
* WHEN...From 7 PM this evening to 7 PM EST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Mixed precipitation is expected with air temperatures
falling below freezing tonight. Expect slippery road conditions
