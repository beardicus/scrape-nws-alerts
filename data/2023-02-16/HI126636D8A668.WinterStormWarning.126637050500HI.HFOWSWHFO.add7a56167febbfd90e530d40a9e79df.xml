<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued February 16 at 3:22AM HST until February 18 at 6:00PM HST by NWS Honolulu</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING FOR BIG ISLAND SUMMITS FROM 6 AM THIS
MORNING THROUGH 6 PM SATURDAY...
.Deep tropical moisture will stream over the island chain during
the next few days, and with temperatures hovering near or below
freezing over the highest elevations of the Big Island, periods
of heavy snow are expected. Once the snow begins, travel to the
summits will become extremely dangerous, with roads quickly
becoming snow covered and slippery. Additionally, gusty winds will
produce widespread blowing and drifting snow, as well as near-zero
visibility at times.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM THIS MORNING
TO 6 PM HST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 2 to 4
feet. Winds gusting as high as 60 mph.
* WHERE...Big Island Summits.
* WHEN...From 6 AM this morning to 6 PM HST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible.
Blowing snow will significantly reduce visibility at times,
with periods of zero visibility.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Warning means significant amounts of snow, sleet,
and ice are expected or occurring. Strong winds are also
possible. This will make travel very hazardous or impossible. Any
travel plans to the summits should be postponed until the threat
diminishes.</instruction>
