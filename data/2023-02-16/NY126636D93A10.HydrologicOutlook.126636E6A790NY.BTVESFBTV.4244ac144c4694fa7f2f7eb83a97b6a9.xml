<description>...Winter/Spring Flood Potential Outlook...
This is the fourth flood outlook for the 2023 winter/spring flood
season. Flood outlooks are issued bi-weekly by the National
Weather Service in Burlington, Vermont to summarize the flood
potential due to snowmelt and break up/formation of river ice
across central and northern Vermont and northern New York. This
outlook is valid for the two week period of February 16 to
March 2, 2023.
...Overview...
The potential for open water flooding is below normal for all of
Vermont and northern New York. Likewise, with little ice cover on
most area rivers away from the far north, the threat of flooding
from ice jams is below normal across most of the area. The only
areas where the threat of ice jam flooding is near normal is
across northeastern New York and northwestern Vermont where ice
cover is slightly greater. Here, a few ice jams are in place and
some modest ice movement will be possible over the next few days.
The first two weeks in February have been relatively quiet
weatherwise, despite a few winter events. Precipitation, and
snowfall, on average have been below normal for most of the area.
Despite a brief, intense outbreak of arctic air on the 3rd and 4th
of the month, temperatures have averaged well above normal.
..Snow Depths and Water Equivalent...
Given the trend of milder than normal temperatures for most of the
winter, snow depths, not surprisingly, continue to average below
normal for nearly all the area. Only a small portion of the
northeastern Adirondacks is showing a near normal snowpack for
mid-February per data from the National Operational Hydrologic
Remote Sensing Center. Depths in general range from bare ground to
perhaps 4 inches in sheltered locations of the Champlain and St.
Lawrence Valleys. In the lower elevations of eastern Vermont
depths range from 4 to 10 inches. Across the mid-terrain of the
Green and Adirondack Mountains (1000-2500 ft elev), surveys
conducted by NWS Burlington and other cooperative partners showed
depths ranging from one to two feet with some variability.
Henderson Lake in the High Peaks region of the Adirondacks (1912
ft) had a depth of 18 inches on February 14. Higher summits,
mainly above 3000 feet show values from 1.5 to 3+ feet, again with
some variability. For example, the Mt. Mansfield snow measurement
site showed a depth of 45 inches on February 14. This was only
75% of normal for the date.
Not surprisingly, snow water equivalents, or SWE, show similar
trends to snow depth values and on average are running below
normal for most of the region. In the lower elevations of the St.
Lawrence and Champlain Valleys, values average from near zero in
areas of near bare ground or patchy snow, to perhaps an inch in
favored, sheltered locations. In the lower elevations of eastern
Vermont SWE values range from 0.5 to 1.5 inches with some
variability. In the mid terrain (1000-2500 ft) of the Green and
Adirondack Mountains, 2 to 4 inches of SWE resides in the pack.
Some variability exists in this elevation band, but in general
these values appear reasonable. NWS Burlington surveys conducted
on February 13 showed a SWE value of 4.1 inches at Roxbury Gap in
the central Green Mountains (2375 ft elev). At the higher summits,
mainly above 3000 feet, values increase to 4 to 6+ inches, though
given the limited geographical area of these regions, the ultimate
contribution to the spring melt is always more limited.
...River and River Ice Conditions...
River flows across the area, where reliable data is present,
remain above to much above the climatological normal values for
the middle of February. This is indicative of the persistent
warmth this winter, as well as a few precipitation events,
allowing for runoff and some modest snowmelt. For example, Lake
Memphremagog at Newport, VT was about 1 foot above its normal
February pool level.
Given the above, river ice coverage understandably remains below
normal for much of the region, especially across watersheds in
central and south central Vermont. Indeed, many of these waterways
remain nearly ice free or have largely open channels as of this
writing. The Winooski River is one example, showing a mainly open
channel from Essex upstream to Montpelier. On far northern streams
and rivers, ice coverage is somewhat greater, indicative of
slightly colder temperatures over time. The highest ice cover
exists on stretches of the Missisquoi, Great Chazy, Ausable and
though there has been a bit of ice growth over the past couple of
days due to colder temperatures. Far northern rivers, such as the
Missisquoi, Great Chazy, Raquette and St. Regis have more
extensive ice coverage, but it likely remains below normal in
strength and thickness that what would be typical for early
February. That said, two ice jams did form over the weekend of
February 11, one on the Great Chazy River near Perry Mills, NY,
and another on the Ausable River at Au Sable Forks, NY. While no
significant flooding was observed near these jams, they will be
monitored going forward over the next few days, or until they
weaken/break up.
...Soil Moisture and Groundwater Conditions...
As mentioned above, the first half of February has been on the
drier side across much of Vermont and northern New York. This
comes after abundant precipitation during the month of January
2023. The net result has been a decrease in near surface soil
moisture over the past two weeks. Near surface soil moisture
anomaly maps from February 14 show most of the region in a near
normal depiction.
Taking a look at groundwater monitoring wells across the region
courtesy of the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ), any
short term dryness has not been felt in groundwater levels. There
are no organized areas across northern New York or Vermont where
groundwater is below normal. In fact, levels are near to above
normal across most of the region. Some of the highest groundwater
levels are seen across northern portions of New York. For example,
the groundwater monitoring well at Brasher Falls was at record
high February levels with a period of record going back 68 years.
...Weather Outlook...
In the near term, guidance suggests generally mild weather by
February standards will persist into early next week with some
mixed precipitation likely through Friday the 17th. By the middle
and latter portions of next week information suggests a gradual
cool down back toward more typical late February norms.
In terms of climate guidance, The North Atlantic Oscillation
(NAO) Index has been positive for virtually all of January and
early February. With a positive NAO there tends to be a very fast
zonal flow across the northern United States and southern Canada.
Any cold air in Canada is quickly shunted east into the North
Atlantic Ocean in the fast zonal flow. So Arctic intrusions,
although not impossible, tend to be short lived and quickly
moderate. This is exactly the scenario we saw earlier this month.
Record setting cold in New England was quickly replaced with much
above normal temperatures in roughly a 48-hour period. There are
some signs that the NAO may weaken or perhaps try and turn
negative as we near the end of February or early March. If this
happens, temperatures would likely trend more seasonal.
The Pacific North America (PNA) pattern has been neutral to
slightly positive so far this February. There are signs that the
PNA index will be turning a bit more negative as we head into the
end of February. With a negative PNA, upper level high pressure
is favored across the southeast United States which typically
results in more of a broad southwest flow across the east coast
and warmer than normal temperatures, at least in the southern
portions of the forecast area. The combination of a positive NAO
and negative PNA is typically not very conducive to snow across
much of the area. However, medium range numerical weather
forecast models suggest the cold air may become just entrenched
enough for mainly wintry precipitation during the last week or so
of February.
The official Climate Prediction Center (CPC) medium range
forecasts seem to agree with this scenario. Temperatures are
expected to average above normal from 20 to 24 February 2023
across the entire region. However, that trend flips during the
last week or so of February when temperatures are likely to
average below normal. Precipitation is expected to be near to
above normal regionwide from now through the end of February.
...Summary...
Based on information available at this time, the Winter/Spring
Flood Potential Outlook for open water flooding in northern New
York and all of central/northern Vermont is below normal over the
next two weeks. While river flows, soil moisture, and groundwater
levels remain normal to elevated, the extant snowpack and the
water contained therein remain below normal. Although the weather
pattern is expected to trend more active over the next couple of
weeks, no large scale runoff events are foreseen at this time.
As a result, this keeps the threat of open water river flooding
to a minimum.
The threat of flooding due to ice jams is also below normal for
most of the area due to a general paucity in river ice coverage
and thickness. This is especially true across central and southern
Vermont. Where river ice coverage is somewhat greater across
northeastern New York and far northwestern Vermont, the threat for
ice jam flooding is near to slightly above normal, and mainly
through early next week given persistent mild weather. This would
include basins such as the Ausable, Great Chazy, Raquette, St.
Regis, and Missisquoi.
It is important to remember that very heavy rainfall can result
in flooding at any time of year, even in areas that have little or
no snow on the ground.
