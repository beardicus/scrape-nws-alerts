<description>...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IS CANCELLED...
* WHAT...A reasonable worst case of up to 1 foot of inundation
above ground level expected in vulnerable areas near
the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...In Connecticut, Southern Fairfield, Southern New
Haven, Southern Middlesex and Southern New London Counties. In
New York, Southern Westchester County.
* WHEN...Through this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding is expected in the more vulnerable
locations near the waterfront and shoreline. Some roads and
low lying properties including parking lots, parks, lawns, and
homes and businesses with basements near the waterfront will
experience minor flooding.
* FORECAST CHALLENGES...There is still uncertainty in the timing
of peak surge relative to the times of high tide today, the
magnitude of wave setup effects over several tidal cycles,
and the fact that Lee is moving to the northeast of the region.
For these reasons, this coastal flood forecast represents a
reasonable worst case forecast.</description>
