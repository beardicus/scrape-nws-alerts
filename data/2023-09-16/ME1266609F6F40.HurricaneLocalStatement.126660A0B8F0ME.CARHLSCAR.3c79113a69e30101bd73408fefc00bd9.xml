<description>This product covers EASTERN AND NORTHERN MAINE
**ALL TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS CANCELLED FOR EASTERN MAINE**
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- All watches and warnings have been canceled
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 130 miles east-northeast of Petit Manan ME or about 80
miles east-northeast of Eastport ME

SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Post Tropical Storm Lee continues to move northeast through the Bay of
Fundy and is no longer producing tropical storm winds or wind gusts
across eastern Maine. Still, north to northeast winds will continue to
remain gust to 25 to 35 mph overnight which may cause a few weakened
trees or tree limbs to be downed. Locally heavy rainfall will continue
into the early morning hours and a flood watch remains in effect for
far eastern Maine. In addition, marine conditions will remain
dangerous due to gale force wind gusts and high surf.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Little to no additional impacts are anticipated at this time across
EASTERN AND NORTHERN MAINE.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Little to no additional impacts are anticipated at this time across
EASTERN AND NORTHERN MAINE.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Remain safely sheltered until conditions improve. When going outside
be sure to stay away from downed power lines, hazardous debris and
flooded areas.
When clearing out fallen trees, be careful with chainsaws and axes.
Always wear protective gear and keep others at a safe distance.
Leaning trees and those which have fallen on roofs or power lines can
be especially dangerous. If you are not in good health or unsure
about what you are doing, have someone with tree cutting experience
do the job. Never cut trees without a partner.
If using a generator, avoid carbon monoxide poisoning by following
instructions provided by the manufacturer. Operate your generator in
a well-ventilated space outside of your living area and away from
open doors and windows.
Problems with sewer backups can further contaminate standing flood
waters. Keep children away from flood waters. Also, listen for boil
water alerts as tap water may have become non-potable.
Be alert for any lingering wind gusts which could take down weakened
trees and/or power lines, collapse damaged structures, or cause
flying debris.
Be alert for flooded roads which could be compromised or littered
with debris. Avoid travel until water levels subside and roads have
been cleared. Do not drive through places where flood waters cover
the road. Turn around, don`t drown!
