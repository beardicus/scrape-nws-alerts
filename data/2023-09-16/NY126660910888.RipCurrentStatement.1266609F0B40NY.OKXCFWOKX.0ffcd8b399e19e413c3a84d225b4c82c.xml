<headline>Rip Current Statement issued September 16 at 4:18AM EDT until September 16 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IS CANCELLED...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Statement, a reasonable worst case
of up to 1 ft of inundation above ground level expected in
vulnerable areas near the waterfront and
shoreline. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of
10 to 16 feet this morning in the surf zone, then
gradually subsiding through the weekend. For the High Rip
Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Southwest Suffolk, Southeast Suffolk and Southern
Nassau Counties.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Statement, through this
afternoon. For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT this
evening. For the High Rip Current Risk, through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding is expected in the more vulnerable
locations near the waterfront and shoreline. Some roads and
low lying properties including parking lots, parks, lawns, and
homes and businesses with basements near the waterfront will
experience minor flooding.
* SWIMMING IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions
Tonight through Saturday. Life-threatening rip currents are
likely for all people entering the surf zone. Anyone visiting
the beaches should stay out of the surf. Rip currents can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* BEACH EROSION AND FLOODING IMPACTS...Large breaking waves will
result in widespread areas of dune erosion and scattered
overwashes through today`s high tides. This may result in
scattered areas of minor flooding of roadways and
vulnerable structures behind protective dunes.
* FORECAST CHALLENGES...There is still uncertainty in the timing
of peak surge relative to the times of high tide today, the
magnitude of wave setup effects over several tidal cycles,
and the fact that Lee is moving to the northeast of the region.
For these reasons, this coastal flood forecast represents a
reasonable worst case forecast.</description>
<instruction>Do not drive through flooded roadways.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
