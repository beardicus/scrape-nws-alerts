SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Lee has become post tropical as it moves northward
through the eastern Gulf of Maine, but continues to generate winds to
near hurricane force winds. The northward movement will continue
through this afternoon, with landfall expected across western Nova
Scotia by late this afternoon. The storm will continue to weaken, but
the wind field will continue to expand.
Tropical storm force winds continue to be possible through this
afternoon across mainly coastal Maine, especially in gusts.
Large, pounding surf in addition to one to three feet of storm surge
will bring the potential for beach erosion and minor coastal
flooding.
While the strongest winds are expected closer to the coastline, gusty
winds will likely still be strong enough to lead to scattered power
outages outside of the warning areas. Please check back frequently for
the latest updates.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across the
area. Remain well sheltered from hazardous wind having possible
limited impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, leading to downed power lines.
- Hazardous driving conditions on bridges and other elevated
roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages likely.
Elsewhere across NEW HAMPSHIRE AND WESTERN MAINE, little to no impact
is anticipated.
FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts. Potential impacts include:
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter currents.
Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may become swollen
and overflow in spots.
- Flood possible in a few places where rapid ponding of water
occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become
near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge
closures.
- Backed up drainage systems near the coast could exacerbate the
flooding from rainfall.
* SURGE:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time across NEW
HAMPSHIRE AND WESTERN MAINE.
* TORNADOES:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time across NEW
HAMPSHIRE AND WESTERN MAINE.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Do not return to evacuated areas until hazardous winds diminish and
flood waters abate.
Do not return to evacuated areas until it is safe. Listen for the all-
clear signal from local authorities.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to remain safely sheltered from the storm. Stay inside
and away from windows. Listen for updates and be ready in case you lose
electrical power. Locate your battery powered radio and flashlight from
your Emergency Supplies Kit. Keep these items close.
Continue to keep your cell phone well charged for as long as
possible. If you lose power, use it more sparingly and mainly for
personal emergencies and check-ins. Do not overload communications
systems with idle chatter.
Do not be a thrill seeker or risk your life for senseless photos or
videos. Be wise and avoid becoming another statistic.
