<description>...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IS CANCELLED...
* WHAT...A reasonable worst case of up to 1 foot of inundation
above ground level expected in vulnerable areas near
the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...Northwest Suffolk, Northeast Suffolk and Northern
Nassau Counties.
* WHEN...Through this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding is expected in the more vulnerable
locations near the waterfront and shoreline. Some roads and
low lying properties including parking lots, parks, lawns, and
homes and businesses with basements near the waterfront will
experience minor flooding.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...Breaking waves of 3 to 5 ft will result in
beach erosion, minor damage possible to dune structures, and
splashover seawalls and bulkheads. This will locally
exacerbate shoreline flooding, particularly in more exposed
areas such as Orient Point.
* FORECAST CHALLENGES...There is still uncertainty in the timing
of peak surge relative to the times of high tide today, the
magnitude of wave setup effects over several tidal cycles,
and the fact that Lee is moving to the northeast of the region.
For these reasons, this coastal flood forecast represents a
reasonable worst case forecast.</description>
