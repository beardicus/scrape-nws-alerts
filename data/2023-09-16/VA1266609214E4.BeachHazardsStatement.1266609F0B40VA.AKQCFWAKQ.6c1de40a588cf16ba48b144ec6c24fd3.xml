<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued September 16 at 11:05AM EDT until September 16 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Wakefield</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...A high risk for rip currents.
* WHERE...In Maryland, coastal Worcester County. In North
Carolina, Eastern Currituck County. In Virginia, Accomack and
Northampton Counties.
* WHEN...Until 8 PM EDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Large breaking waves of 6 to 7 ft
will result in dangerous surf conditions and a high risk for
rip currents. Do not enter or approach the water due to the
risk of being swept away.</description>
<instruction>Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
