<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued September 16 at 4:52AM EDT until September 16 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON EDT TODAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON EDT TODAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents
and large breaking waves in the surf zone. For the High Surf
Advisory, large breaking waves of 5 to 8 feet in the surf
zone. For the Coastal Flood Warning, 2 to 4 feet of inundation
above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines and
tidal waterways.
* WHERE...East Carteret County.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, through Saturday
evening. For the High Surf Advisory, until noon EDT Saturday.
For the Coastal Flood Warning, until noon EDT Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Some roads may be closed. Low lying property
including homes, businesses, and some critical infrastructure
will be inundated. Some shoreline erosion will occur. Dangerous
swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw a swimmer or
surfer head first into the bottom causing neck and back
injuries.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most critical factor in this event will
be the powerful ocean wave run up, which will bring seawater up
and over vulnerable dune structures, across roads, and onto
properties. High tide is at 8:30 PM this evening, and low tide
is around 9 AM Saturday morning.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
