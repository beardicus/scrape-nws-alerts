Additional tree damage, power outages and road flooding are possible.
-Residents across the entire region should remain vigilant and monitor
for updates.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across far
Downeast Maine. Remain well sheltered from dangerous wind having
additional significant impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
Potential impacts from the main wind event are also now unfolding
across much of the rest of Eastern Maine. Remain well sheltered from
hazardous wind having additional limited impacts.
Elsewhere across NORTHERN MAINE, little to no impact is anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
Eastern and Downeast Maine. Remain well guarded against dangerous flood
waters having possible significant impacts. If realized, these impacts
include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals,
arroyos, and ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
Elsewhere across NORTHERN MAINE, little to no impact is anticipated.
* SURGE:
Little to no additional impacts are anticipated at this time across
EASTERN AND NORTHERN MAINE.
* TORNADOES:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time across EASTERN AND
NORTHERN MAINE.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
Now is the time to stay inside and away from windows. Listen for
updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Keep a battery-
powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.
Keep your cell phone charged and in power-saving mode. If you lose
power, use it sparingly and mainly for personal emergencies and check-
ins.
Do not be a thrill seeker or risk your life for senseless photos or
videos.
