SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Lee has become post tropical as it moves northward
through the eastern Gulf of Maine, but continues to generate hurricane
force winds. The northward movement will continue today, with landfall
expected across western Nova Scotia late this afternoon. The storm
will only gradually weaken today, but the wind field will continue to
expand across our forecast area.
The potential exists for tropical storm conditions to develop by early
this morning along the coastline, which would then continue through
this afternoon. The strongest winds are expected across coastal
portions of New Hampshire and western Maine.
Large, pounding surf in addition to one to three feet of storm surge
will bring the potential for beach erosion and minor to moderate
coastal flooding.
Locally heavy rainfall is also possible at times, particularly across
MidCoast Maine where localized flooding can`t be ruled out.
While the strongest winds are expected closer to the coastline, gusty
winds will likely still be strong enough to lead to scattered power
outages outside of the warning areas. Please check back frequently for
the latest updates.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
coastal New Hampshire and western Maine. Potential impacts in this
area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, leading to downed power lines.
- A few roads impassable from debris, caused by downed branches
and power lines. Hazardous driving conditions on bridges and
other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages likely.
Elsewhere across NEW HAMPSHIRE AND WESTERN MAINE, little to no impact
is anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts. Potential impacts include:
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter currents.
Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may become swollen
and overflow in spots.
- Flood possible in a few places where rapid ponding of water
occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become
near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge
closures.
- Backed up drainage systems near the coast could exacerbate the
flooding from rainfall.
Prepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across western Maine.
* SURGE:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time across NEW
HAMPSHIRE AND WESTERN MAINE.
* TORNADOES:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time across NEW
HAMPSHIRE AND WESTERN MAINE.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
For those not under evacuation orders, understand that there are
inherent risks to evacuation (such as traffic congestion, accidents,
and driving in bad weather), so evacuate only if necessary. Help
keep roadways open for those that are under evacuation orders.
If you are exceptionally vulnerable to wind or water hazards from
tropical systems, consider voluntary evacuation, especially if
being officially recommended. Relocate to a predetermined shelter
or safe destination.
If evacuating away from the area or relocating to a nearby shelter,
leave early before weather conditions become hazardous.
Do not return to evacuated areas until hazardous winds diminish and
flood waters abate.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to remain safely sheltered from the storm. Stay
inside and away from windows. Listen for updates and be ready in case
you lose electrical power. Locate your battery powered radio and
flashlight from your Emergency Supplies Kit. Keep these items close.
During the peak of the storm, keep your shoes on and rain gear handy.
Boots and tennis shoes offer the best foot protection if you become
unexpectedly exposed to the elements.
Continue to keep your cell phone well charged for as long as
possible. If you lose power, use it more sparingly and mainly for
personal emergencies and check-ins. Do not overload communications
systems with idle chatter.
Do not venture outside while in the eye of a hurricane. Within the
eye, weather conditions may temporarily improve which can be
misleading. Once the eye passes, the wind will change direction and
return to dangerous speeds. Heavy rain will also return. Be smart and
remain safely hidden from the storm.
Do not be a thrill seeker or risk your life for senseless photos or
videos. Be wise and avoid becoming another statistic.
Be ready to move to the identified safe room if your home or shelter
begins to fail. Quickly move to an interior room on the lowest floor.
Put as many sturdy walls between you and the storm as you can.
Protect your head and body.
When major hurricanes make landfall, extreme winds bring a tremendous
threat to life and cause devastating to catastrophic damage. During
landfall, listen for extreme wind warnings which indicate the exact
timing and location of these incredible life-threatening winds. If
issued for you area, move to the safest place within your home or
shelter. Take the same life-saving actions as if it were a violent
tornado.
