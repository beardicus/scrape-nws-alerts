<headline>Flood Warning issued June 09 at 2:26PM AKDT  by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 PM AKDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding is occurring.
* WHERE...Sagavanirktok River near Dalton Highway from Mileposts 401
to 407.
* WHEN...Until 200 PM AKDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Flood waters are eroding the Dalton Highway between
Milepost 401 and 407, with the road down to one lane. If
conditions worsen, the road may wash out and become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 200 PM AKDT, the Sagavanirktok River continues to flow out
of its bank due to remnant ice in the main channel. This is
forcing the water over its bank to the west and causing
erosion along the Dalton Highway near milepost 403. These
conditions are expected to persist until ice in the main
channel clears. Elevated flows are expected to continue,
especially with rainfall expected late this week.
- Rain and snowmelt in the Brooks Range will cause the
Sagavanirktok River to continue to slowly rise through the
weekend.
