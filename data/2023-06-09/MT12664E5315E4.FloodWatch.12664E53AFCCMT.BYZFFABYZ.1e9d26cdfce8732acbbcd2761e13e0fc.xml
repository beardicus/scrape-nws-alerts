<headline>Flood Watch issued June 09 at 9:21PM MDT  by NWS Billings</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM MDT SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of central, south central, and southeast Montana,
including the following areas, in central Montana, Golden Valley,
Judith Gap, Musselshell and Southern Wheatland. In south central
Montana, Northeastern Yellowstone and Treasure. In southeast
Montana, Carter, Custer, Fallon, Northern Rosebud and Powder River.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM MDT Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The ground remains saturated across the watch area, and it
will not take very much rainfall, or very heavy rainfall
rates, to result in excessive runoff and flooding. A cold
front moving in from the northeast is expected to generate
additional precipitation overnight tonight. Thus the watch
will continue through 6 am Saturday morning.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action
should Flash Flood Warnings be issued. If you are in a flood prone
location be sure to have a way to receive warnings overnight that
will wake you up to take action if necessary.</instruction>
