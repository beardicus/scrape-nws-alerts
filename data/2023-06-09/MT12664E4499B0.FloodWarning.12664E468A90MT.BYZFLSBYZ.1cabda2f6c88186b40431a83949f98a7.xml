MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...A portion of central Montana, including the following
county, Golden Valley.
* WHEN...Until 600 AM MDT.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is occurring. Streams continue to rise
due to excess runoff from earlier rainfall. It will take several
hours for all the water from these storms to work through local
drainage systems.

reports water over highway 12 in spots, and law enforcement
reports flooding in and around Lavina and Ryegate. The water
level in the dam of concern above Ryegate is falling
according to local law enforcement, but the all clear has not
been given. Between 2 and 4 inches of rain have fallen over
the area.

Creek, Currant Creek, Ninemile Creek, Musselshell River,

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles. Do not drive on or attempt to cross
flooded roads, find an alternate route. Roads and driveways may be
damaged or washed out in places.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Remain alert for flooding of creeks, streams, and normally dry
coulees even in areas not receiving rainfall downstream of the burn
area. These can become raging killer currents in a matter of minutes
even from distant rainfall upstream.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency officials and
request they pass the information to the National Weather Service in
Billings.</instruction>
