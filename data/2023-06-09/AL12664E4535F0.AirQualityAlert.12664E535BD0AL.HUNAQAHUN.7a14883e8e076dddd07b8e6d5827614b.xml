<headline>Air Quality Alert issued June 09 at 7:28AM CDT  by NWS Huntsville</headline>
<description>...Air Quality Alert in effect Friday for Huntsville and Decatur...
The Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) has issued
an Air Quality Alert for Madison and Morgan counties for today.
An air quality alert means that ground level ozone or particulate
matter concentrations are expected to reach levels that are unhealthy
for sensitive groups. Children and people with asthma are at the
highest risk under these expected conditions.
ADEM recommends the following actions during an air quality alert
day:
Conserve electricity and set your air conditioner at a higher
temperature.
Limit driving and combine errands.
Use the bus or car pool to work.
Avoid use of gasoline power lawn and garden equipment.
Refuel cars and trucks after 6 pm.
Limit engine idling.
Use household, workshop, and garden chemicals in ways that keep
evaporation to a minimum, or try to avoid them when poor air quality
is forecast.
If breathing becomes difficult, move indoors.
For more information on what to do on an Air Quality Alert day,

Quality Forecast. You can also visit the Environmental Protection
