<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY FOR SNOWMELT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL FURTHER
NOTICE...
* WHAT...Minor flooding caused by snowmelt is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of Mesa County along Plateau Creek, from the
outlet of Vega Reservoir down to the confluence with the Colorado
River.
* WHEN...Until further notice.
* IMPACTS...Elevated stream flows will continue to cause minor
flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1113 AM MDT, public reports and gage data have indicated
high water along Plateau Creek near Collbran, downstream to
the confluence with the Colorado River. Forecast hydrographs
maintain high water levels, oscillating near bankfull
conditions through the weekend. Minor flooding along creek
banks has been reported and is expected to redevelop each
night, when diurnal fluctuations typically maximize.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Collbran and Molina.

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads, bike paths
or sidewalks.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding. In addition, this is typically when diurnal
peaks are observed along Plateau Creek.</instruction>
