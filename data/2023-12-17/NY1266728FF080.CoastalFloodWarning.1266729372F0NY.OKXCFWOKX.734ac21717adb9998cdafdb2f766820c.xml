<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued December 17 at 7:00PM EST until December 18 at 6:00PM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 10 PM THIS
EVENING TO 6 PM EST MONDAY...
* WHAT...1 1/2 to 2 1/2 ft of inundation above ground level is
likely in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline
with the Monday afternoon high tide. Less than 1 ft inundation
above ground level is possible with tonight`s high tide.
* WHERE...In Connecticut, Southern Fairfield, Southern New
Haven, Southern Middlesex and Southern New London Counties. In
New York, Southern Westchester County.
* WHEN...From 10 PM Sunday to 6 PM EST Monday. Minor flooding
possible with tonight`s high tide. Widespread moderate
flooding likely with the Monday afternoon high tide.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Widespread moderate flooding (up to 2
1/2 ft of inundation) of vulnerable areas is expected near the
waterfront and shoreline, including roads, parking lots,
parks, lawns, and homes and businesses with basements near the
waterfront. Numerous road closures are likely, and vehicles
parked in vulnerable areas near the waterfront will likely
become flooded.
* RIVER FLOOD IMPACTS...Flooding with the Monday afternoon high
tide will likely extend inland from the waterfront up tidal
rivers. Surge up the Hudson River will affect low lying
riverfront communities in Westchester, Rockland, Orange and
Putnam counties. In addition, heavy rainfall and/or runoff
coinciding with the Monday afternoon high tides will
exacerbate street and property flooding issues along tidally
affected rivers of Westchester and southern CT.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...Breaking waves of 3 to 5 ft during the
Sunday Night and possibly Monday afternoon high tides. This
will result in widespread beach erosion, with minor damage
possible to shoreline structures, and wave splashover onto
shoreline roads and properties.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Peak surge of 3 1/2 to 5 ft will likely
be between high tidal cycles Monday morning. The timing of
windshift late Monday morning into early Monday afternoon will
be critical to the coverage and magnitude of moderate coastal
flooding. Residents of vulnerable coastal locales should
prepare for the potential for widespread moderate flooding (2
1/2 ft of inundation) late Monday morning into Monday
afternoon. In addition, heavy rainfall and/or runoff
coinciding with the tonight and Monday afternoon high tides
will exacerbate street and property flooding issues along the
coast and tidally affected rivers of Westchester and southern
CT, as well as the Hudson River.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
