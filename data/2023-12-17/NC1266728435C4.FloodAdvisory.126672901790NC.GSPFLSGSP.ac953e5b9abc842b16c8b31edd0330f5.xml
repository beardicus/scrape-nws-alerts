* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 613 PM EST, Stream gauge reports indicated that Mallard
Creek has risen slightly out of its banks near Pavilion Blvd
following 1 to 2 inches of rainfall earlier today. Any
additional rise on the creek could lead to partial flooding
of the PNC Music Pavilion parking lots or other low-lying
areas nearby. Continuing runoff and drainage into the Rocky
River will cause it to continue to rise for several more
hours. Additional flood advisories could be needed in
Cabarrus County later tonight.

Northeast Charlotte, Harrisburg, University City and Croft.
