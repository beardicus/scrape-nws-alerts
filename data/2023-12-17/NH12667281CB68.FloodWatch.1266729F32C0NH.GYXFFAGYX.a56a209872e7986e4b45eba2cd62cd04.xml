<headline>Flood Watch issued December 17 at 2:30AM EST until December 18 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>.A potent storm system will bring widespread moderate to heavy
rainfall to western Maine and New Hampshire Sunday night into
Monday. Rainfall amounts of between 1-3 inches are likely with
localized amounts in excess of 4 inches possible across southern
facing mountain slopes. This will combine with snow melt and ground
frost across the north and mountains to exacerbate the flooding
threat. Minor to moderate flooding is possible along main stem
rivers as well as streams, many of which are still running high from
last week`s rainfall. Widespread low-land and poor drainage flooding
is also possible.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH LATE MONDAY
NIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of central and southern New Hampshire, including
the following areas, in New Hampshire, Western And Central
Hillsborough. In central New Hampshire, Belknap and Merrimack. In
southern New Hampshire, Eastern Hillsborough.
* WHEN...From late tonight through late Monday night.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Area creeks and streams are running high and could flood with more
heavy rain.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor the latest forecast and be alert for possible
Flood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be
