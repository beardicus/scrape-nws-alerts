fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order.
Excessive runoff from heavy rainfall will cause dangerous flooding,
especially near creeks and streams, drainage ditches, and low-lying
flood prone areas. Turn around, don`t drown if you encounter a
flooded road. Most flood deaths occur in vehicles. Stay away from
storm drains, culverts, creeks, and streams. Water levels can rise
rapidly and sweep you away.</instruction>
