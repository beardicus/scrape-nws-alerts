* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rainfall totals of 2.0 to 4.0 inches are forecast across the
watch area tonight and Monday, with the heaviest falling
later tonight through early Monday morning. Locally higher
amounts are probable. The ground is more saturated due to
heavier rain over the last couple of weeks. A period of
higher hourly rainfall rates are expected later tonight into
early Monday morning, and this can locally enhance the
flooding especially in urban areas.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
