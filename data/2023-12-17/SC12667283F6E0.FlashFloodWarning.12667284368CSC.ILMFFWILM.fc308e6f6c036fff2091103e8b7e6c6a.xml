FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>Dangerous flooding from heavy rainfall can be expected, especially
near poor drainage areas and other flood prone locations. It is
harder to recognize flood dangers at night, as it will be difficult
to determine the depth of the water. Roads may be damaged or washed
away. Most flood deaths occur in vehicles. If flooding is observed,
then turn around, don`t drown.</instruction>
