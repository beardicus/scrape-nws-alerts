* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with locally higher amounts,
possibly as much as 5 to 6 inches, are forecast across the
watch area tonight into Monday. The heaviest rainfall is
expected to fall late tonight into early Monday morning. The
combination of heavy rainfall and the already saturated
grounds due to heavier rain over the last week will likely
result in streams across the area experiencing rapid rises
resulting in flooding along low-lying and flood-prone
locations.
