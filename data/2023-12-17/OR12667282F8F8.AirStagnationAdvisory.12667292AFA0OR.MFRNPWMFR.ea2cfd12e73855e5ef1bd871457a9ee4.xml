<description>...AIR STAGNATION ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST
MONDAY...
...WIND ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM MONDAY TO 1 AM PST
TUESDAY...
* WHAT...For the Air Stagnation Advisory, stagnant air is
expected, which may lead to deteriorating air quality. For the
Wind Advisory, southeast winds 20 to 25 mph with gusts up to
45 mph expected.
* WHERE...The Air Stagnation Advisory is in effect for all area
valleys. The Wind Advisory is for the southern Rogue Valley
between Ashland and Medford, including Interstate 5.
* WHEN...For the Air Stagnation Advisory, until 10 AM PST
Monday. For the Wind Advisory, from 10 AM Monday to 1 AM PST
Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Gusty winds could blow around unsecured objects.
Tree limbs could be blown down and a few power outages may
result. Air stagnation is likely to result in diminishing air
quality with time, especially in and near areas with
significant sources of air pollution. Diminished air quality
is likely to cause health issues for people with respiratory
problems if precautions are not taken.

https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/map/?wfo=mfr</description>
<instruction>Use extra caution when driving, especially if operating a high
profile vehicle. Secure outdoor objects.
People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with diminished air quality. N95 masks are
effective at filtering out the majority of harmful air
particulates.
State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor
burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be
limited as much as possible. According to state air quality
agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants
close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with
your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
