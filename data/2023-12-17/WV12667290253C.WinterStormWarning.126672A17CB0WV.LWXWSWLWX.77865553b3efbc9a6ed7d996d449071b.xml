<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM MONDAY TO
10 AM EST TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations around 6
to 10 inches on the western slopes with 3 to 6 inches on the
eastern slopes. West to northwest wind gusts around 30 to 50
mph are expected as well.
* WHERE...In Maryland, Garrett County. In West Virginia, Western
Grant and Western Pendleton Counties.
* WHEN...From 1 PM Monday to 10 AM EST Tuesday. Rain will change
to light snow and flurries early Monday morning above 2,500
feet. Heavier snow is expected to develop Monday afternoon
between 1 and 4 PM. Heavier bursts of snow and possible snow
squalls are expected Monday night before snow gradually tapers
off Tuesday morning and midday.
* IMPACTS...The combination of snow and blowing snow will reduce
visibility below one-half mile at times causing near blizzard
conditions, especially on the western slopes Monday night. The
hazardous conditions will impact the evening commute Monday
and the morning commute Tuesday with snow covered and slippery
surfaces. Gusty winds could bring down tree branches and a few
power outages may result.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
When venturing outside, watch your first few steps taken on
steps, sidewalks, and driveways, which could be icy and slippery,
increasing your risk of a fall and injury.</instruction>
