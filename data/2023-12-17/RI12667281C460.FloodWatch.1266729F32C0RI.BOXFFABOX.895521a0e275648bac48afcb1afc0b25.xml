<headline>Flood Watch issued December 17 at 2:12AM EST until December 18 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Boston</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM THIS EVENING THROUGH MONDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Massachusetts, including the following areas,
Central Middlesex MA, Northern Bristol MA, Northern Middlesex MA
and Western Norfolk MA and northern Rhode Island, including the
following areas, Eastern Kent RI, Southeast Providence RI and
Western Kent RI.
* WHEN...From this evening through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Heavy rain between one and two inches falling over an area
with current three hour flash flood guidance around two
inches and six hour flash flood guidance between two and a
half and three inches may result in rapid stream and small
river rises. Given similar rain totals fell just a week ago,
soils remain saturated and rivers remain swollen, yielding
the potential for renewed flooding risks.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
