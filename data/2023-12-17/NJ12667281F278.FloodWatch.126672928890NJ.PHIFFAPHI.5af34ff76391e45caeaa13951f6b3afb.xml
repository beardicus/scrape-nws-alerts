* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rainfall totals of 2.0 to 3.0 inches are forecast across the
watch area today and Monday, with the heaviest falling later
tonight through early Monday morning. Locally higher amounts
are probable. The ground is more saturated due to heavier
rain over the last couple of weeks. A period of higher hourly
rainfall rates are expected later tonight into early Monday
morning, and this can locally enhance the flooding especially
in urban areas.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
