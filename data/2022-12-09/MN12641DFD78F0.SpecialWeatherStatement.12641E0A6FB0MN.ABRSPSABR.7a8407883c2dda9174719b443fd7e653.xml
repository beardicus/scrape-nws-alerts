<description>...A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RAIN AND ICE AND SNOW IS POSSIBLE NEXT
WEEK...
A winter storm is forecast to move out of the Rockies Monday
night and track northeast across the central and northern plains
through Wednesday night. Its influence will be felt up into the
northern plains, including central and northeast South Dakota, and
west central Minnesota, where a mix of winter precipitation will
be possible. Presently, the heaviest precipitation potential
exists from early Tuesday morning through Wednesday night. By
Wednesday morning, strong north winds may be spreading over into
the Missouri River valley region, adding blowing and drifting snow
potential to the forecast over central and north central South
Dakota.
Difficult travel conditions are possible between Monday night and
Thursday morning from a combination of potentially significant
snow accumulation, icy roads, and drifting snow. If you have
travel or outdoor plans next week, be sure to check the latest
forecasts and road conditions, as well as carry a winter survival
kit in your vehicle.</description>
