<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM THIS
AFTERNOON TO 10 PM PST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy wet snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 10
to 22 inches, except up to 3 feet towards the Mount Shasta Ski
area. Wind gusting as high as 45 mph, will cause reduced
visibility due to blowing snow.
* WHERE...South Central Siskiyou County, including all areas
along I-5 and highway 89, Grass Lake on highway 97 as well as
Mt. Shasta City, Dunsmuir, McCloud and Tennant.
* WHEN...From 4 PM Friday to 10 PM PST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Areas of
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute. The combination of snow loading on trees and gusty
winds could bring down trees or tree branches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Heavy snow rates between 1-2 inches per
hour are expected tonight. This in combination with the high
snowfall rate will result in occasional blizzard like conditions
with visibility below a half mile near Weed (including I-5) and
possibly as far south as Mt. Shasta City. The timing for
blizzard like conditions is expected to be between 9 PM and 1
AM PST tonight.

<instruction>* Travel is strongly discouraged because of dangerous conditions.
* If you must travel, keep tire chains, a flashlight, blankets,
food, water, medications, and a fully charged phone with you. Do
not detour during winter storms.
* The safest place during a winter storm is indoors.
* A Winter Storm Warning means that severe winter weather is
imminent and poses a threat to life and property. Take
protective action now.</instruction>
