<headline>Flood Watch issued July 24 at 2:11AM MST until July 24 at 4:30AM MST by NWS LasVegas</headline>
<description>.Monsoonal moisture in place over the region will lead to multiple
periods of thunderstorms capable of heavy rainfall and the rapid
onset of flash flooding. This risk will be greatest for known burn
scars in southern Mohave County, but several area roads could also
experience flooding as a result of the multiple rounds of heavy
rainfall through Wednesday night.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY MORNING THROUGH LATE TUESDAY
NIGHT...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by multiple rounds of thunderstorms
producing excessive rainfall.
* WHERE...Southern Mohave County, specifically along and south of
the Route 66 and Interstate 40 corridors. This would include
Kingman, Hualapai Mountains, Wikieup, Golden Valley, and Yucca.
* WHEN...From Monday morning through late Tuesday night.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff and heavy downpours may result in the
rapid onset of flooding in area washes, creeks, streams, and other
low-lying and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- In addition to flash flooding, these thunderstorms will be
capable of producing gusty outflow winds over 40 mph and
frequent cloud to ground lightning.
