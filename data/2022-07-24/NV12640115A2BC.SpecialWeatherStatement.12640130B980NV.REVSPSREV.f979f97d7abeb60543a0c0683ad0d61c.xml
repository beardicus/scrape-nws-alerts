<description>...Hot Temperatures Continue Through The Week, Oak Fire Smoke
Expanding North and East Across The Region, and An Increase In
Chances For Thunderstorms Starting Monday...
* Hot temperatures likely continuing for multiple days as high
temperatures may flirt with daily records at some locations.
Widespread Moderate with isolated High heat impacts are likely,
so ensure you take necessary precautions to limit effects for
heat sensitive folks and pets. Make sure to stay hydrated, avoid
strenuous outdoor activities, and check in on vulnerable
neighbors, family or friends. Keep an eye on the forecast and
consider rescheduling outdoor activities to cooler parts of the
day, if possible.
* Smoke lofted by the Oak Fire in Mariposa County, CA will
continue to creep across the Sierra Front and into western NV as
afternoon southwest winds kick in and transport smoke
particulates across the crest. Expect continued smoke impacts
and degraded air quality particularly overnight and into the
early morning hours as smoke settles into the valleys. Areas
across the Tahoe Basin, Carson Valley, and eastern Sierra could
see these cycles of degraded air quality with improvement by the
afternoon as valley inversions break, followed by additional
smoke late afternoon and evening. The duration of the smoke
impacts will be dependent on the intensity and activity of the
fire through the week. For the latest air quality information
please visit: www.airnow.gov and www.fire.airnow.gov
* An increasing moist southerly flow, coupled with the continued
hot conditions will increase the potential for isolated
thunderstorms as early as Monday across parts of Mono and
Mineral counties. Most thunderstorms developing in the late
afternoon and early evening will be high based with the
potential to produce strong outflows with gusts to 50-60 mph at
the surface. The thunderstorms potential will continue to
expand northward into portions of the Tahoe Basin and the Sierra
Front by Tuesday and possibly make a repeat performance
Wednesday as well. Thunderstorm chances will continue from the
latter half of next week into next weekend. Strong/gusty
outflows, dry lightning strikes, and isolated areas of heavy
rainfall will be possible.</description>
