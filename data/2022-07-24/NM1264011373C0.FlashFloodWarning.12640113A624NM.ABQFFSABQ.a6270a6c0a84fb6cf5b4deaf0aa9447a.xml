<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 345 AM MDT EARLY THIS
MORNING FOR SOUTHWESTERN MORA COUNTY...
At 216 AM MDT, Doppler radar indicated additional showers moving
into the warned area over northern portions of the Hermits Peak-Calf
Canyon wildfire burn scar. Additional rainfall amounts up to 0.25
inches are possible in the warned area, potentially leading to
excessive runoff and a continuation of debris flows near and into
the Mora River. The debris flow can consist of water, ash, soot,
rock, mud, burned vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Heavier rainfall from earlier along with additional
shower activitiy will keep the threat for burn scar
flash flooding and debris flows.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Life threatening flash flooding of creeks and streams,
urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses. Debris
flows or rapid torrents of water, rocks, ash, soot and
burned timber will be capable of carving a destructive
path down the Mora River near Holman and southeastward.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Mora, Cleveland, Holman, La Cueva and Golondrinas.
This includes the following highways...
State Road 518 between Mile Markers 22 and 43.
State Road 283 near Mile Marker 13.
