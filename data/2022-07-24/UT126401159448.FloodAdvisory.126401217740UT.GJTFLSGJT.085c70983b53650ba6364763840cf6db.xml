flooding. Between 0.5 and 1.25 inches of rain have fallen.
- This includes the following streams and drainages...
Hunters Canyon, Kane Springs Canyon and Colorado River.
Additional rainfall amounts of 0.2 to 0.5 inches are expected

<instruction>In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
