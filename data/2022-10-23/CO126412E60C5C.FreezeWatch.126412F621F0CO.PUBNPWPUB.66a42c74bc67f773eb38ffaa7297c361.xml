<headline>Freeze Watch issued October 23 at 3:59AM MDT until October 24 at 9:00AM MDT by NWS Pueblo</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM MDT EARLY THIS
MORNING...
...FREEZE WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...For the High Wind Warning, southwest winds 15 to 25 mph
with gusts up to 60 mph. For the Freeze Watch, sub-freezing
temperatures as low as 25 possible.
* WHERE...El Paso County.
* WHEN...For the High Wind Warning, until 6 AM MDT early this
morning. For the Freeze Watch, from late tonight through
Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...Damaging winds may blow down trees and power lines.
Widespread power outages are expected. Travel will be difficult,
especially for high profile vehicles. Frost and freeze
conditions could kill crops, other sensitive vegetation and
possibly damage unprotected outdoor plumbing.</description>
<instruction>People should avoid being outside in forested areas and around
trees and branches. If possible, remain in the lower levels of
your home during the windstorm, and avoid windows. Use caution if
you must drive.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
