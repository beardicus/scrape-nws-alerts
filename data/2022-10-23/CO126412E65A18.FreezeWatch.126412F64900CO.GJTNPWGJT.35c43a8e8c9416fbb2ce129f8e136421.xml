<instruction>Use extra caution when driving, especially if operating a high
profile vehicle. Secure outdoor objects.
People, especially those with respiratory illnesses, heart

indoors and avoid prolonged outdoor exercise or heavy exertion
due to wind-blown dust.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
