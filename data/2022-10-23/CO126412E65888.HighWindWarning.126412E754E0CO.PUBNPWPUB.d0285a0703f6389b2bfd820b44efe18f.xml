<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON MDT TODAY...
...FREEZE WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH

with gusts up to 60 mph. For the Freeze Watch, sub-freezing
temperatures as low as 25 possible.
* WHERE...El Paso County.
* WHEN...For the High Wind Warning, until noon MDT today. For
the Freeze Watch, from late tonight through Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...Damaging winds may blow down trees and power lines.
Widespread power outages are expected. Travel will be
difficult, especially for high profile vehicles. Frost and
freeze conditions could kill crops, other sensitive vegetation
and possibly damage unprotected outdoor plumbing.</description>
<instruction>People should avoid being outside in forested areas and around
trees and branches. If possible, remain in the lower levels of
your home during the windstorm, and avoid windows. Use caution if
you must drive.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
