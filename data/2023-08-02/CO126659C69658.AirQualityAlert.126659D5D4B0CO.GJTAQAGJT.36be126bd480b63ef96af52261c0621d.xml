<description>...AIR QUALITY HEALTH ADVISORY FOR WILDFIRE SMOKE FROM 900 AM
WEDNESDAY UNTIL 900 AM THURSDAY...
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has
issued the following...
WHAT...Air Quality Health Advisory for Wildfire Smoke.
WHERE...central Gunnison County. Locations include, but are not
limited to, Gunnison.
WHEN...900 AM Wednesday August 02 to 900 AM Thursday August 03
IMPACTS...The Lowline wildfire is located in central Gunnison
County approximately 10 miles southwest of Crested Butte and 14
miles northwest of Gunnison. Moderate to heavy smoke is possible
early Wednesday morning from the fire, southward along County Road
730 to Gunnison. Smoke in these areas should decrease by late
Wednesday morning as atmospheric mixing increases. By Wednesday
afternoon, showers and thunderstorms with gusty, erratic winds
could send smoke in any direction. Late Wednesday night and into
Thursday morning, smoke could again get heavy as it drains
eastward towards County Road 730 and southward into Gunnison.
HEALTH INFORMATION...Public Health Recommendations: If smoke is
thick or becomes thick in your neighborhood you may want to remain
indoors. This is especially true for those with heart disease,
respiratory illnesses, the very young, and the elderly. Consider
limiting outdoor activity when moderate to heavy smoke is present.
Consider relocating temporarily if smoke is present indoors and is
making you ill. If visibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in
your neighborhood, smoke has reached levels that are unhealthy.</description>
