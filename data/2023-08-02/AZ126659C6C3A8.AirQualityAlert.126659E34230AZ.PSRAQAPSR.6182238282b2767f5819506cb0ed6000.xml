<description>...OZONE HIGH POLLUTION ADVISORY FOR THE YUMA AREA THURSDAY...
The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) has issued an
Ozone High Pollution Advisory for the Yuma area on Thursday.
This means that forecast weather conditions combined with existing
ozone levels are expected to result in local maximum 8-hour ozone
concentrations that pose a health risk. Adverse health effects
increase as air quality deteriorates.
Ozone is an air contaminant which can cause breathing difficulties
for children as well as persons with respiratory problems. A
decrease in physical activity is recommended.
You are urged to car pool, telecommute or use mass transit.
The use of gasoline-powered equipment should be reduced or done late
in the day.
For details on this High Pollution Advisory, visit the ADEQ internet
site at www.azdeq.gov/forecast/yuma or call 602-771-2300.</description>
