SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Idalia sits in the Yucatan Channel and is forecast
to move into the southeast Gulf of Mexico late Monday into Tuesday.
Idalia is forecast to gain strength over the eastern Gulf as it
moves closer to Florida.
The following are the primary hazards of concern with Idalia:
* Coastal Flooding/Surge - Higher than usual tides due to the
combination of surge from Idalia and the full moon could lead to
moderate to major coastal flooding over portions of the southwest coast
of Florida. The periods of highest tides look to occur on Tuesday and
Wednesday. Additionally, minor tidal flooding will be possible for the
SE coast of Florida in the period.
* Rainfall - The majority of the rainfall associated with the system
is forecast to fall Monday afternoon through Wednesday. The
greatest risk for flash flooding will be for portions of the Gulf Coast,
with storm total rain amounts of 2-3 inches and localized higher
amounts. Additionally, localized rainfall totals of 1-2 inches will be
possible across portions of the SE coast of Florida during this period.
* Wind - Increasingly gusty winds are forecast Tuesday through
Thursday, particularly along the Gulf coast and adjacent coastal
waters. A reasonable worst case scenario would have tropical storm force
winds across Collier County between Monday night and Wednesday. Areas of
the East Coast and Atlantic waters could also see gusty winds up to 35 mph
during the same time frame.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Prepare for life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across coastal Collier County. Potential impacts in
this area include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
Also, prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across coastal mainland Monroe county.
Elsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact is anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant
impacts across the Gulf Coast. Potential impacts
include:
- Ditches and canals may quickly become swollen with swift
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
Prepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across the remainder of South Florida.
* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across areas
of South Florida west of Lake Okeechobee. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Some large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
WATCH/WARNING PHASE - Listen to local official for recommended
preparedness actions, including possible evacuation. If ordered to
evacuate, do so immediately.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies
kit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your
home or business.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
near the ocean or a large inland lake, in a low-lying or poor
drainage area, in a valley, or near an already swollen river, plan to
move to safe shelter on higher ground.
Always heed the advice of local officials and comply with orders that
are issued. Do not needlessly jeopardize your life or the lives of
others.
When securing your property, outside preparations should be concluded
as soon as possible before conditions deteriorate. The onset of
strong gusty winds or flooding can cause certain preparedness
activities to become unsafe.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes
to the forecast.
