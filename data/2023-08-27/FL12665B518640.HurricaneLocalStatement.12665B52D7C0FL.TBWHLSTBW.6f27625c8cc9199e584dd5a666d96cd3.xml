SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Idalia remains off of the Yucatan Coast tonight.
Idalia is forecast to move north and eventually northeast
across the eastern Gulf of Mexico, making its way towards the Florida
peninsula as a hurricane. Watches remain in effect for West Central
and Southwest Florida and adjacent coastal waters.
The following are the primary hazards of concern with Idalia:
* Wind - Winds will increase Tuesday and remain gusty even after the
storm passes into Thursday. Hurricane force winds are possible across
much of the area and should be what residents prepare for, with
tropical storm force winds across the southern zones.
* Coastal Flooding/Surge - Areas across the Nature Coast are forecast
to see high to extreme levels of surge. The main period of coastal
flooding looks to occur Tuesday afternoon through early Thursday.
* Rainfall - The majority of the rainfall associated with the system
is forecast to fall Tuesday and Wednesday. A slight risk for flooding
is possible, mainly along the coast and across the northern zones.
Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches with locally higher amounts up to
10 inches is possible.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for life-threatening wind having possible devastating impacts
across the Nature Coast and Tampa Bay region. Potential impacts in this
area include:
- Structural damage to sturdy buildings, some with complete roof
and wall failures. Complete destruction of mobile homes. Damage
greatly accentuated by large airborne projectiles. Locations
may be uninhabitable for weeks or months.
- Numerous large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and
roadway signs blown over.
- Many roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. Many bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Widespread power and communications outages.
Also, prepare for life-threatening wind having possible limited to
extensive impacts across Southwest Florida.
* SURGE:
Prepare for life-threatening surge having possible devastating
impacts along the Nature Coast. Potential impacts in this area
include:
- Widespread deep inundation, with storm surge flooding greatly
accentuated by powerful battering waves. Structural damage to
buildings, with many washing away. Damage greatly compounded
from considerable floating debris. Locations may be
uninhabitable for an extended period.
- Near-shore escape routes and secondary roads washed out or
severely flooded. Flood control systems and barriers may become
stressed.
- Extreme beach erosion. New shoreline cuts possible.
- Massive damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Numerous small craft broken away from moorings with many lifted
onshore and stranded.
Also, prepare for life-threatening surge having possible significant
to extensive impacts across Tampa Bay and Southwest Florida.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant
impacts across West Central and Southwest Florida. Potential impacts
include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals, and
ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
West Central and Southwest Florida. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and boats pulled
from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local officials for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
For those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,
falling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move,
relocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help
keep roadways open for those under evacuation orders.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
near the ocean or a large inland lake, in a low-lying or poor
drainage area, or near an already swollen river, plan to move to safe
shelter on higher ground.
Always heed the advice of local officials and comply with orders that
are issued. Do not needlessly jeopardize your life or the lives of
others.
