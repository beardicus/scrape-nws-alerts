<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 27 at 9:09PM EDT until August 28 at 3:30AM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 AM EDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Central and southern Union County, North Carolina
* WHEN...Until 300 AM EDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks, greenways,
boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and parking lots.
Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.  A few flood-
prone, low-water crossings may become impassible
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 858 PM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated heavy rain due to thunderstorms are ongoing across
central and southern Union County.  Areas of southwest Union
County, including Waxhaw, Mineral Springs, and Wesley Chapel,
have seen 1-2 inches of rain fall in an hour, which is
causing excessive runoff and rapid rises on small streams.
Nuisance to minor flooding of adjacent low-lying areas is
imminent and other areas of flooding may develop over the
next 1-3 hours as heavy rainfall persists from Waxhaw to
Monroe to Marshville.
Areas of greatest concern for flooding include areas between
Waxhaw, Mineral Springs, and Wesley Chapel within the
Twelvemile Creek watershed, along and north of NC 75
including near Waxhaw-Indian Trail Rd, Pleasant Grove Rd,
Shannon Rd, Billy Howe Rd, New Town Rd, Potter Rd, and Old
Waxhaw-Monroe Rd.  Please exercise caution on area roadways
and avoid low-lying areas adjacent to area streams for the
next few hours.
- Additional rainfall of 1-2 inches is possible over the next
60-90 minutes.  A Flash Flood Warning may be needed if
ongoing storms do not dissipate within the next hour.  Please
stay weather aware and be prepared to seek higher ground if
you are in an area vulnerable to flooding.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Monroe, South Charlotte, Indian Trail, Weddington,
Unionville, Wesley Chapel, Wingate, Waxhaw, Mineral Springs,
Marvin, Sturdivants, Jaars and Trinity.

dangers of flooding.
