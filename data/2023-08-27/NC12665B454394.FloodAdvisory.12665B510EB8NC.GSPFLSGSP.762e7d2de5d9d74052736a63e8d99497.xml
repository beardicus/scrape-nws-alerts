<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 27 at 7:01PM EDT until August 27 at 8:30PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 1245 AM EDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of piedmont North Carolina, including the
following county, Mecklenburg.
* WHEN...Until 1245 AM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including parks, greenways,
golf courses, underpasses, and parking lots.
Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 654 PM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated heavy rain due to thunderstorms. Minor flooding is
ongoing or expected to begin shortly in the Advisory area.
Between 1 and 2 inches of rain have fallen in less than an
hour, especially in a very localized area around Uptown
Charlotte.  This is causing rapid rises on small drainages
and streams in Charlotte, including Little Sugar Creek,
especially near Medical Center Dr.  Flooding of the Little
Sugar Creek greenway is ongoing and will persist over the
next 60-90 minutes.  Heavy rainfall is ending from west to
east across Charlotte, with another 0.50-1 inch possible
towards Mint Hill.  Thereafter, additional heavy rainfall is
not expected over the next 1-2 hours.  However, additional
heavy rainfall is possible later tonight and new areas of
flooding may develop.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Uptown Charlotte, Central Charlotte, South Charlotte, East
Charlotte, Northeast Charlotte, Southwest Charlotte,
Northwest Charlotte, West Concord, Matthews, Mint Hill,
Pineville, Harrisburg, The Plaza, Freedom Park, Hidden
Valley, Southpark Mall, Reedy Creek Park, The Arboretum, and
University City.</description>
