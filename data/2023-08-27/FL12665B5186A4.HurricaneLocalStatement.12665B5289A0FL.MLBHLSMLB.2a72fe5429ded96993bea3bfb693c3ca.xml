<description>This product covers East Central Florida
**Tropical Storm Idalia Forecast to be Stronger Over the Eastern Gulf
of Mexico**
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Northern Lake and
Southern Lake
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 660 miles south-southwest of Leesburg FL
- 19.8N 85.3W
- Storm Intensity 60 mph
- Movement Stationary
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
The center of Tropical Storm Idalia is located 145 miles south of
the tip of western Cuba late this evening. Idalia is nearly
stationary, but an increase in forward speed toward the north then
northeast is forecast on Monday and Tuesday. The storm is currently
forecast to approach the Florida Gulf coast Tuesday night into
Wednesday. Preparations should be ongoing for at least tropical storm
conditions by midweek.
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Lake County, where confidence
is highest in tropical storm conditions occurring. Additional watches
may be necessary for portions of east-central Florida early Monday
morning.
Showers and thunderstorms associated with Idalia will reach central
Florida as early as Monday afternoon, with conditions further
deteriorating Tuesday afternoon and evening as Idalia accelerates
north-northeastward across the eastern Gulf of Mexico. As coverage of
showers and squalls increases Tuesday afternoon into Wednesday, the
possibility of strong to damaging wind gusts will also increase.
Tropical storm force winds are forecast to extend outward from the
storm`s center, potentially reaching portions of east-central Florida,
including Lake County, Tuesday night into Wednesday morning. Based on
the current forecast track, Idalia will make its closest pass to
east-central Florida late Tuesday night and Wednesday morning,
continuing northeastward during the day on Wednesday.
While the heaviest rainfall from Idalia is currently forecast to fall
along the Gulf Coast and western Florida Peninsula, gusty squalls will
be capable of torrential downpours, especially Tuesday and Wednesday.
One to two inches of rain from Monday afternoon through Wednesday
night is expected for a large portion of the area, with locally higher
amounts possible. Locations in closer proximity to the center of
Idalia, such as Lake County in east-central Florida, may receive
higher rainfall totals.
In addition to strong wind gusts, a threat for tornadoes is forecast
to develop as the center of Idalia moves into the eastern Gulf of
Mexico from Tuesday afternoon into Wednesday.
Incoming swell from Hurricane Franklin combined with winds from Idalia
will likely lead to high seas, rough surf, an increase in
life-threatening rip currents, and beach erosion Tuesday into
Wednesday.
Do not let your guard down, especially in locations outside of the
current Tropical Storm Watch. Impacts from Idalia will be experienced
far from the center of the storm. Now is the time to ensure your
hurricane supply kit is stocked and your safety plan is in place.
As Idalia becomes better organized over the next 24 to 36 hours,
additional changes to the current forecast are possible. Eastward
shifts in the forecast track would increase the potential for impacts
locally, so continue to monitor the latest forecasts from the National
Hurricane Center and National Weather Service in Melbourne, Florida.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for dangerous wind having possible significant impacts across
east central Florida. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across East Central Florida. Potential impacts
include:
- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter currents.
Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may become swollen
and overflow in spots.
- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually
vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding of water
occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become
near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge
closures.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
East Central Florida. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
* SURGE:
Direct surge impacts from Idalia are not currently anticipated at
this time. However, larger swells and surf combined with Hurricane
Franklin will bring a threat for minor coastal flooding and beach
erosion.Locations more vulnerable to coastal flooding and beach
erosion, such as portions of the Volusia County coast, should stay
updated on the latest forecasts.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local officials for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies
kit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your
home or business.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
When securing your property, outside preparations should be concluded
as soon as possible before conditions deteriorate. The onset of
strong gusty winds or flooding can cause certain preparedness
activities to become unsafe.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes
to the forecast.
There is a threat from tornadoes with this storm. Have multiple ways
to receive Tornado Warnings.
