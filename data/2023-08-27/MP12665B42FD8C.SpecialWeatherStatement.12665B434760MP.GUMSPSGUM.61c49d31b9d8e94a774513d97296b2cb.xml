<headline>Special Weather Statement issued August 27 at 6:11PM ChST  by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>A tropical circulation northwest of Saipan continues to gradually
develop. As it does this, a southwesterly monsoon will persist
across the region through Wednesday afternoon, helping to maintain
a rich tropical airmass capable of producing locally heavy showers
and a few thunderstorms.
Timing:   Through Wednesday evening
Location: All of the Mariana Islands
Rainfall: 4 to 8 inches with locally higher amounts possible
Land:     Sustained winds of 15 to 25 mph, with gusts to 35 mph
will continue through Tuesday night, especially near
heavier showers and thunderstorm that develop.
Marine:   Sustained winds of 15 to 25 knots with gusts to 35 knots
will continue through Tuesday night.
Seas:     7 to 10 feet are expected to build into the 9 to 12
foot range for Monday afternoon through Wednesday.
Surf of 7 to 9 feet for south facing reefs will continue
through Tuesday evening, then they may decrease on
Wednesday. Surf for west facing reefs in the 7 to 9 foot
range will continue through Wednesday, and possibly
through Friday night.
Impacts:  Periods of urban flooding are possible. Minor coastal
beach erosion is also possible. Hazardous marine
conditions will continue at least through Wednesday,
possibly longer.</description>
