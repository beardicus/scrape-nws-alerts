<description>...EXCESSIVE HEAT WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM MONDAY TO 8 PM PDT
TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Dangerously hot conditions with maximum temperatures in
the upper 90s to near 104 expected. Overnight low temperatures
in the 70s to lower 80s in some foothill locations will provide
little relief from the heat.
* WHERE...Calabasas and Agoura Hills.
* WHEN...From 10 AM Monday to 8 PM PDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Extreme heat will significantly increase the potential
for heat related illnesses for anyone, especially for sensitive
populations, including young children, the elderly, and those
working outdoors or participating in outdoor activities.</description>
<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
