<headline>Special Weather Statement issued August 27 at 9:36AM ChST  by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>A developing tropical system, known as Invest 93W from the Joint
Typhoon Warning Center, is currently located west of Saipan, around
16N and 143E. This system continues to slowly get more organized. A
southwesterly monsoon flow is strengthening, with the strongest winds
located just south of Guam. As 93W consolidates, it will drift slowly
eastward today, then northwestward later, allowing the monsoon flow to
lift northward to encompass all of the Marianas, with sustained
southwesterly winds increasing.
Timing:   Through Wednesday evening
Location: All of the Mariana Islands
Rainfall: 4 to 8 inches with locally higher amounts possible
Land:     Sustained winds of 15 to 25 mph, with gusts to 35 mph
will continue through Tuesday night, especially near
heavier showers and thunderstorm that develop.
Marine:   Sustained winds of 15 to 25 knots with gusts to 35 knots
will continue through Tuesday night.
Seas of 7 to 10 feet for the Guam and Rota coastal waters
will spread north into Tinian`s and Saipan`s coastal waters
by this afternoon. Seas will then peak Tuesday into
Wednesday in the 10 to 14 foot range, highest in the
western coastal waters.
Surf of 9 to 11 feet today will continue along south and
west facing reefs, possibly reaching a peak of 13 feet
Tuesday or Wednesday.
Impacts:  Periods of urban or flash flooding possible. Minor coastal
beach erosion is also possible. Hazardous marine conditions
will continue.</description>
