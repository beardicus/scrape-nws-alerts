- A Storm Surge Watch and Tropical Storm Watch are in effect for
Coastal Collier County
- A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Inland Collier County

SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Idalia is forecast to move into the southeast Gulf of Mexico
late Monday into Tuesday. Idalia is forecast to gain strength over the
eastern Gulf as it moves closer to Florida.
The following are the primary hazards of concern with Ten/Idalia:
* Coastal Flooding/Surge - Higher than usual tides due to the
combination of surge from Idalia and the full moon could lead to minor
coastal flooding in vulnerable, low-lying coastal areas.
* Rainfall - The majority of the rainfall associated with the system
is forecast to fall Monday afternoon through Wednesday. The greatest
risk for flash flooding will be near the Gulf coast. Storm total rain
amounts of 2-3 inches with localized higher amounts. The highest
amounts are anticipated along the Gulf coast.
* Wind - Increasingly gusty winds are forecast Tuesday through
Wednesday, particularly along the Gulf coast and adjacent coastal
waters.
* Tornadoes - A low-end tornado threat is possible through early
Wednesday as banding from the system moves ashore.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Prepare for life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across coastal Collier County. Potential impacts in this area
include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
Also, prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across coastal mainland Monroe county.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant
impacts across the Gulf Coast. Potential impacts include:
- Ditches and canals may quickly become swollen with swift
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
Prepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across the remainder of South Florida.
* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
areas of South Florida west of Lake Okeechobee. Potential impacts in
this area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Some large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact is anticipated.
* TORNADOES:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time across South Florida.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions, including
possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so immediately.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies
kit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your
home or business.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
Always heed the advice of local officials and comply with orders that
are issued. Do not needlessly jeopardize your life or the lives of
others.
