<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 27 at 9:48PM EDT until August 28 at 3:30AM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 330 AM EDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Central and southern Mecklenburg County, North Carolina
and northeastern York County, South Carolina.
* WHEN...Until 330 AM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including parks, greenways,
golf courses, underpasses, and parking lots.  Isolated, shallow
flows over roadways is possible.  A few flood-prone, low-water
crossings may become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 935 PM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated heavy rain due to thunderstorms over the past 60-90
minutes from Fort Mill and Tega Cay to Pineville.  Between 1
and 2 inches of rain has fallen across this area, on top of
1-2 inches of rainfall which fell earlier this evening.
While heavy rainfall is departing the area, excessive runoff
will continue over the next 1-2 hours, causing rapid rises on
small streams and nuisance to Minor flooding of adjacent low-
lying areas.
While streams have receded from earlier heavy rainfall,
including Little Sugar Creek, Briar Creek, Steele Creek and
McAlpine Creek, these streams and associated drainages are
starting to rise again and a few areas may exceed bankfull
levels, flooding adjacent greenways and other low-lying
areas.  Isolated roadway flooding is imminent.
Areas in northeastern York County, near Tega Cay and Fort
Mill, including near Springfield Parkway, SC 160, US 21, and
Old Nation Rd, are also prone to flooding from this heavy
rainfall.  Please exercise caution on area roadways and avoid
low-lying areas adjacent to area streams for the next few
hours.
Fortunately, rainfall is ending across the Advisory area.  No
additional heavy rainfall is expected and conditions will
gradually improve over the next few hours.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Rock Hill, Uptown Charlotte, Central Charlotte, South
Charlotte, Southwest Charlotte, East Charlotte, Northeast
Charlotte, Matthews, Mint Hill, Weddington, Fort Mill,
Pineville, Tega Cay, Lesslie, Marvin, The Arboretum,
Southpark Mall, Freedom Park, Carowinds and The Plaza.

dangers of flooding.
Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.</instruction>
