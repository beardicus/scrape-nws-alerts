<description>...WIND ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM THIS EVENING TO 3 AM
PDT MONDAY...
...EXCESSIVE HEAT WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM MONDAY TO
8 PM PDT TUESDAY...
* WHAT...For the Wind Advisory, north winds 20 to 30 mph with
gusts up to 45 mph expected. For the Excessive Heat Warning,
dangerously hot conditions with temperatures in the mid 90s to
around 105 degrees expected. Overnight low temperatures in the
mid 70s to mid 80s in some locations will provide little
relief from the heat.
* WHERE...Santa Ynez Mountains Western Range.
* WHEN...For the Wind Advisory, from 6 PM this evening to 3 AM
PDT Monday. For the Excessive Heat Warning, from 10 AM Monday
to 8 PM PDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Gusty winds will blow around unsecured objects and
make driving difficult, especially for high profile vehicles.
Tree limbs could be blown down and a few power outages may
result. Extreme heat will significantly increase the potential
for heat related illnesses for anyone, especially for sensitive
populations, including young children, the elderly, and those
working outdoors or participating in outdoor activities.</description>
<instruction>Use extra caution when driving, especially if operating a high
profile vehicle. Secure outdoor objects.
Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
