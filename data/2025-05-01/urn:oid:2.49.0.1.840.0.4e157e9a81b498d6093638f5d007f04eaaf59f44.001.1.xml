        <headline>Hydrologic Outlook issued May 1 at 10:03PM AKDT by NWS Anchorage AK</headline>
        <description>ESFAFC

As of 19:15 AKDT Thursday, ice began running past Stony River and
water levels rose approximately 2 ft. As of 21:00 AKDT the ice
continues to run and the water levels are steady.

The River Watch team on Wednesday saw no intact ice until 8 miles
upstream of the Tatlawitsuk River. River Watch also confirmed on
Wednesday that the Tatlawitsuk, Swift, and Stony rivers were all
free of ice. On Thursday evening, local residents in Stony River
assume this run is intact ice that was released between Devils Elbow
and upstream of the Tatlawitsuk River.

At this time, the NWS urges residents in Stony River, Sleetmute, Red
Devil, and Crooked Creek to be prepared for rising water levels and
runs of ice through the evening into Friday morning. As of 15:00
AKDT the Kuskokwim River is free of ice all the way to approximately
Chuathbaluk, and any ice jams would be from temporary grounding
through low water reaches. Estimated time for the ice to reach
Crooked Creek is approximately  08:00 AKDT. At this time we are not
expecting any flooding to occur.

This Hydrologic Outlook will be revised on Friday morning once we
receive additional information regarding location and integrity of
the ice run.

The River Watch Team will continue to reach out to local community
members for observations, and fly Friday morning as soon as weather
permits to assess river conditions between Bethel and upstream of
Crooked Creek. To share any local observations, please email
anchorage.weather@noaa.gov.
