        <description>An unsettled weather pattern remains in store for Palau and Yap
through at least the weekend, as two tropical disturbances known as
Invests 99W and 90W remain to be the primary weather makers in
western Micronesia.

JTWC's Invest 99W is currently centered near 8N131E west-northwest
of Palau's coastal waters, continuing its trek away from the region
as monsoon-like flow continues to bring heavy showers, thunderstorms
and gusty winds to the region for the next several days. Due to the
continuous delays in potential tropical cyclone development, shower
coverage is expected to continue to diminish along the southeastern
peripheries, which brings diminished shower coverage to much of
Palau. However, showers and thunderstorms are expected to remain
heavy whenever they do occur, but variability in areas of convective
development may produce periods of little to no weather as well once
a "dirty ridge" develops nearby. At this time, landslides continue to
be unlikely; however, if soils become saturated, any additional
rainfall may quickly become runoff and increase mudslide risks. On-
and-off showers are expected for a little longer after 99W's exit,
with drier conditions expected by the middle of next week.

JTWC's Invest 90W is currently centered near 4N141E well south of
Eauripik in eastern Yap State, slowly drifting northward as a muddled
mess of convection with a lackluster center of rotation. Model
guidance was pinging on this feature to become the more dominant one
in the region for many model runs, but the environment has continued
to be unforgiving, disallowing 90W from consolidating significantly.
Even so, model guidance continues to show this feature to continue to
shift north-northwestward across much of eastern Yap State,
potentially becoming an open wave as is passes over Yap Proper during
the weekend. During passage, this system will bring numerous heavy
showers, some thunderstorms and gusty winds Saturday and Saturday
night, with conditions improving considerably by early next week.

Residents and mariners should monitor the latest forecasts for the
region at weather.gov/gum/PublicForecasts and any information shared
by WSO Palau and WSO Yap for their local regions.
