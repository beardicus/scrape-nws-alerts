<description>...Freezing Rain, Snow Overnight Through Monday...
.A potent, quick moving storm system will bring freezing rain and
snow to the region overnight through the day Monday.
Freezing rain spreads into and north of Interstate 94 overnight,
starting to mix with and then change over to snow by mid to late
Monday morning. Snow persists, mostly north of Highway 10 in
north-central Wisconsin, through the afternoon with the storm
exiting northeast in the evening.
Icing up to one third inch is possible. With winds expected to
gust 30 to 40, areas that receive the heavier icing could
experience tree damage and power outages. The bulk of the snow
accumulations will be confined north of Highway 29 in north-
central Wisconsin with a few inches possible.
Temperatures will play a key role in what falls where, and how
much. Small changes could result in shifts in precipitation types
and amounts. Pay close attention to later forecasts for any
revisions to what is expected.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM TO NOON
CST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow accumulations
of up to one inch and ice accumulations of up to two tenths of
an inch. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...Trempealeau, Monroe, Juneau and Adams Counties.
* WHEN...From 3 AM to noon CST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning commute.</description>
