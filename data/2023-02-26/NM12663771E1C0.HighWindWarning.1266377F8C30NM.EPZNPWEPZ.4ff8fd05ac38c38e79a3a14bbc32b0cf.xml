<headline>High Wind Warning issued February 26 at 10:44AM MST until February 27 at 12:00AM MST by NWS El Paso</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT MST
TONIGHT...
* WHAT...West winds 45 to 55 mph with gusts up to 85 mph
expected.
* WHERE...Portions of south central New Mexico and southwest
Texas. This includes Hudspeth county in west Texas, the
Sacramento mountains of south central New Mexico, and the
lowlands west of the Guadalupe mountains in Otero county.
* WHEN...From 9 AM Sunday to midnight MST Sunday night.
* IMPACTS...Damaging winds will blow down trees and power lines.
Widespread power outages are expected. Travel will be
difficult, especially for high profile vehicles. Local areas
of blowing dust will reduce visibilities and make travel
dangerous across some of the lower elevations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The strongest winds and wind gusts will
occur over exposed ridges, through passes, and over areas east
of high ridges.</description>
<instruction>People should avoid being outside in forested areas and around
trees and branches. If possible, remain in the lower levels of
your home during the windstorm, and avoid windows. Use caution if
you must drive.</instruction>
