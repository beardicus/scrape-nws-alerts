<description>...Freezing Rain, Snow Overnight Through Monday...
.A potent, quick moving storm system will bring freezing rain and
snow to the region overnight through the day Monday.
Freezing rain spreads over and north of the Interstate 94 corridor
overnight, starting to mix with and then change over to snow by
mid to late Monday morning. Snow persists, mostly north of
Highway 10 in north-central Wisconsin, through the afternoon with
the storm exiting northeast in the evening.
Icing up to one third of an inch is possible. With winds expected
to gust 30 to 40 mph, areas that receive the heavier icing could
experience tree damage and power outages. The bulk of the snow
accumulations will be confined north of Highway 29 in north-
central Wisconsin with a few inches possible.
Temperatures will play a key role in icing amounts. Small changes
could result in substantial shifts in impacts. Pay close
attention to the forecast for any revisions.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM TO NOON
CST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Freezing rain expected. Total ice accumulations of
around one tenth of an inch. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.
