<description>...Freezing Rain, Snow Overnight Through Monday...
.A potent, quick moving storm system will bring freezing rain and
snow to the region overnight through the day Monday.
Freezing rain spreads over and north of the Interstate 94 corridor
overnight, starting to mix with and then change over to snow by
mid to late Monday morning. Snow persists, mostly north of
Highway 10 in north-central Wisconsin, through the afternoon with
the storm exiting northeast in the evening.
Icing up to one third of an inch is possible. With winds expected
to gust 30 to 40 mph, areas that receive the heavier icing could
experience tree damage and power outages. The bulk of the snow
accumulations will be confined north of Highway 29 in north-
central Wisconsin with a few inches possible.
Temperatures will play a key role in icing amounts. Small changes
could result in substantial shifts in impacts. Pay close
attention to the forecast for any revisions.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM TO NOON CST
MONDAY...
* WHAT...Freezing rain. Total ice accumulations one to two tenths
of an inch. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...Jackson County with the greatest impacts in the northern
part of the county.
* WHEN...From 3 AM to noon CST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Difficult travel conditions are possible. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning commute.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency. Prepare for possible power
outages.
