<description>...Locally Dense Fog Spreading into Western Lake County...
At 255 AM, surface observations, satellite imagery and traffic
cameras showed locally dense fog spreading into Lake County from
the northwest. The fog was located from Highway 50 north to the
Marion County line, impacting The Villages, Lady Lake, Okahumpka,
U.S. Highway 441 northwest of Leesburg, and the Florida Turnpike
northwest of State Highway 19. Visibilities had dropped to one
mile or less in some locations.
The fog is expected to linger past sunrise, eventually burning
off around 9 AM. If you will be out driving early this morning,
prepare to encounter rapid reductions in visibility due to dense
fog. When driving in dense fog, slow down, use your low beam
headlights, and leave plenty of driving distance between your car
and the one in front of you.
If the fog becomes more dense and widespread, then a Dense Fog
Advisory will be issued.</description>
