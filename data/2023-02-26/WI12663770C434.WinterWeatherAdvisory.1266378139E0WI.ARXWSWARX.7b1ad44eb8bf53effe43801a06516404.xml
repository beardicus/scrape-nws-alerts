<description>...Freezing Rain, Snow Overnight Through Monday...
.A potent, quick moving storm system will bring freezing rain and
snow to the region overnight through the day Monday.
Freezing rain spreads into and north of Interstate 94 overnight,
starting to mix with and then change over to snow by mid to late
Monday morning. Snow persists, mostly north of Highway 10 in
north-central Wisconsin, through the afternoon with the storm
exiting northeast in the evening.
Icing up to 1/4&quot; is possible. With winds expected to gust into the mid
30s mph, areas that receive the heavier icing could experience
tree damage and power outages. The bulk of the snow accumulations
will be confined north of Highway 29 in north-central Wisconsin
with a few inches possible.
Temperatures will play a key role in what falls where, and how
much. Small changes could result in shifts in precipitation types
and amounts. Pay close attention to later forecasts for any
revisions to what is expected.
