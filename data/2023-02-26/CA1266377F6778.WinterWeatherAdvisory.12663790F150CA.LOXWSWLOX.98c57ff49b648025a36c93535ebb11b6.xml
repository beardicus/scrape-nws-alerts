WEDNESDAY EVENING...

Interior Mountains.
* WHEN...For the Winter Weather Advisory, until 1 PM PST

* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible due to
reduced visibility due to snow and blowing snow. Mountain roads

be another substantial travel hazard. The weight of recent snow
combined with strong winds may down trees and powerlines,
causing power outages. The worst impacts are expected late
