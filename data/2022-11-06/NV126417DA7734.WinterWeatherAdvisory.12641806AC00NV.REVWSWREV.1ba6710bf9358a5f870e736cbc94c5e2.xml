<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued November 06 at 2:29PM PST until November 09 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM TUESDAY TO
4 AM PST WEDNESDAY...
* CHANGES...Snow impacts for Monday morning are trending weaker,
with better potential for widespread valley snow on Tuesday.
Winter Weather Advisory is now in effect starting 10am Tuesday.
* WHAT...Snow expected. Monday snow accumulations will be up to an
inch, mainly above 5000 ft. Tuesday snowfall totals of 1-3
inches for Reno-Sparks, 3-6 inches for Carson Valley and 6-10
inches for the foothills. Locally higher totals are possible in
the foothills west of Highway 395 and south of US-50.
* WHERE...Greater Reno-Carson City-Minden Area.
* WHEN...From 10 AM Tuesday to 4 AM PST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning commutes. Gusty winds
could bring down tree branches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS... While there may be breaks in snowfall
during the advisory period, hazardous road conditions may
persist as cold temperatures will help to refreeze wet road
surfaces.</description>
<instruction>Even light snowfall could cause considerable travel delays,
especially during periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow
extra time to reach your destination. Leave extra space between
vehicles since it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
