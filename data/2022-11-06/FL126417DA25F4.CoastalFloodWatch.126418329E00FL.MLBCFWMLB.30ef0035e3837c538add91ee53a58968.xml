<headline>Coastal Flood Watch issued November 06 at 3:21PM EST until November 11 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Melbourne</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE MONDAY
NIGHT...
...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH
FRIDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Onset of coastal flooding and additional beach erosion
likely on Tuesday, and then moderate to major coastal flooding
and major beach erosion possible Wednesday and Thursday.
Numerous, strong and life-threatening rip currents with large
breaking waves 6 to 7 feet through tonight, and 7 to 8 feet
Monday.
* WHERE...Coastal Volusia, Coastal Indian River, Coastal Saint
Lucie, Coastal Martin, Mainland Northern Brevard, Northern
Brevard Barrier Islands, Mainland Southern Brevard and
Southern Brevard Barrier Islands Counties.
* WHEN...High risk of rip currents continues through late Monday
night. The potential for coastal flooding will begin late Monday
night and continue through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS... Coastal flooding impacts will include the potential
for some roads to be closed. Low lying property including homes,
businesses and some critical infrastructure may be inundated.
Major shoreline erosion will be possible this week. Rip currents
can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper
water. Large breaking waves can knock you off your feet and make
you even more susceptible to becoming caught in the seaward
pull of a rip current.</description>
<instruction>Conditions favorable for coastal flooding are expected to
develop as early as Tuesday and continue to worsen through mid-
week. Coastal residents should pay close attention to the
evolving weather threat this week and be alert for later
statements or warnings as the threat to lives and property may
continue to increase through the week. Now is the time to take
action to protect flood-prone property.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as jetties and
piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs. Entering the water is strongly discouraged for the next
several days!</instruction>
