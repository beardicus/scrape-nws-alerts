<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued November 06 at 2:29PM PST until November 09 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM THIS EVENING
TO 4 AM PST WEDNESDAY...
* CHANGES...Delayed the start time of the Winter Weather Advisory
to 7 PM due to slower storm motion.
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 4
inches, except up to 6 inches above 5000 feet. Winds gusting
as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Northern Washoe County and Surprise Valley California.
* WHEN...From 7 PM this evening to 4 AM PST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS... While there may be breaks in snowfall
during the advisory period, hazardous road conditions may
persist as cold temperatures will help to refreeze wet road
surfaces.</description>
<instruction>Even light snowfall causes major travel delays, especially during
periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to
reach your destination. Leave extra space between vehicles since
it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
