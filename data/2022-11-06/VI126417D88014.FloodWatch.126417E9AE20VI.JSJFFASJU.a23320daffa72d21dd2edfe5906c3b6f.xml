<headline>Flood Watch issued November 06 at 5:41AM AST  by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by additional rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands, including the
following areas, in Puerto Rico, Central Interior, Culebra,
Eastern Interior, Mayaguez and Vicinity, North Central, Northeast,
Northwest, Ponce and Vicinity, San Juan and Vicinity, Southeast,
Southwest, Vieques and Western Interior. In Virgin Islands, St
Croix and St.Thomas...St. John...and Adjacent Islands.
* WHEN...Through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water crossings may be
flooded. Mudslides and landslides along steep terrains are
possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Even though drier air is expected to move in today, the soils
are very saturated and the rivers are still running higher
than normal. Therefore, any significant rainfall could
quickly cause urban and river flooding. There is still a
strong mid to upper level trough centered north of
Hispaniola, which could cause some instability, and therefore
scattered moderate showers and isolated thunderstorms are
possible. Over 5 inches of rain have already been observed in
some areas of Puerto Rico, and near 5 inches in the U.S.
Virgin Islands, an additional inch or so of rain is forecast
today across portions of south and eastern Puerto Rico as
well as across the U.S. Virgin Islands.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action
should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.</instruction>
