Visibility as low as one half mile.
* WHERE...Bristol Bay, north and west of King Salmon.
* WHEN...From 9 PM Sunday to 9 AM AKST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Expect difficult travel conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A strong front quickly tracks eastward
towards western Alaska late Sunday. Gusty southeasterly winds
along the front move inland overnight Sunday into Monday. Heavy
snowfall combined with strong winds will reduce visibilities
around the same time. A brief period of freezing rain will
develop along the Bristol Bay coast. Warmer air will then help
transition to all rain for Monday afternoon and evening as the
front advances eastward.</description>
