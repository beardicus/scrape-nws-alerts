<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 31 at 3:09PM CST until February 04 at 12:00AM CST by NWS Springfield</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE TUESDAY NIGHT
THROUGH THURSDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Storm total storm snow amounts over six inches are expected
over a
wide area with the highest amounts northwest of I-44. Freezing rain
and sleet accumulation will be more significant along and southeast
of I-44 along with some snow accumulation as well.
* WHERE...Portions of southeast Kansas. Portions of central, east
central, south central, southwest, and west central Missouri.
* WHEN...From late Tuesday night through Thursday evening. Rain will
spread into the area during the day Tuesday with a cold frontal
passage. As very cold Arctic air begins to move into the region
Tuesday night, rain will change over to a mix of snow, sleet, and
freezing rain toward midnight over southeast Kansas into central
Missouri. The wintry mix will reach counties near the I-44
corridor by 6 am Wednesday, then to near the Arkansas state line
by late Wednesday afternoon and early evening. The precipitation
will transition to mostly snow Wednesday night with a wintry mix
still possible close to the Arkansas state line. Snow will
continue Thursday before gradually tapering off late in the day
and in the evening.
* IMPACTS...Areas in the Winter Storm Watch will likely see a
disruption to travel. Some power outages may be possible where ice
accumulation is higher. Much colder air will move into the region
Wednesday night through Friday with temperatures falling into the
single digits and teens at times. The hazardous conditions will
likely impact the Wednesday and Thursday morning and evening
commutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A Winter Storm Watch means the weather
pattern favors significant
winter weather over the region. However, smaller scale changes to
the forecast storm track and resultant precipitation types,
accumulation, and timing will result in further forecast changes
over the next couple of days. Continue to monitor updated forecasts,
but also prepare for winter weather during the midweek period.</description>
