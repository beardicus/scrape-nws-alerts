<headline>Flood Watch issued January 31 at 3:34PM CST  by NWS Houston - Galveston</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT CST TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of south central Texas and southeast Texas,
including the following areas, in south central Texas, Coastal
Jackson and Inland Jackson. In southeast Texas, Austin, Brazoria
Islands, Burleson, Coastal Brazoria, Coastal Matagorda, Colorado,
Fort Bend, Inland Brazoria, Inland Matagorda, Matagorda Islands,
Waller, Washington and Wharton.
* WHEN...Until Midnight CST tonight.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Widespread steady light to moderate rain will continue to
impact the area in the remaining afternoon hours and on into
this evening. Periods of locally heavy rain will still be
possible with any of the stronger thunderstorms or where any
training develops. Rainfall totals as high as 4 to almost 5
inches have been been reported but have been isolated so far.
Most locations in the Watch area have received 1/2 to 2
inches with little to no impacts so far. With the storms
system still situated to our west, it remains possible that
additional showers and thunderstorms could develop and
produce more locally heavy rainfall. Any additional rainfall
occurring on already saturated locations could lead to
flooding issues. If the trend of only light to moderate rain
persists, minimal impacts can be expected.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
