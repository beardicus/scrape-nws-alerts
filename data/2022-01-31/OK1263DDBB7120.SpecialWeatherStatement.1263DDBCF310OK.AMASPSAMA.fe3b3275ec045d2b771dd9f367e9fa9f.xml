<description>...MORE SNOW HEADED FOR THE PANHANDLES...
An upper level storm system is expected to track south through the
Great Basin on Tuesday and through southern New Mexico and West
Texas on Thursday.  An arctic cold front will move south across the
Panhandles Wednesday morning.  Moisture will increase across the
area to help produce widespread snowfall across the Panhandles late
Tuesday night through Thursday.
Accumulating snowfall of 2 to 5 inches will be possible across
much of the Panhandles by the time the snow comes to an end
Thursday afternoon.
Snow is expected to develop over the Oklahoma Panhandle late Tuesday
night and then it is expected to spread southward across the rest of
the area by Wednesday morning.  Snow will continue off and on
Wednesday through Thursday morning before ending from west to east
Thursday afternoon.
Falling snow, low visibilities, and slick roadways may affect the
commutes Wednesday morning, Wednesday evening, and again Thursday
morning.  North winds of 15 to 25 mph may cause areas of blowing and
drifting snow Wednesday and Wednesday night.
Wind chill readings are expected to be in the -5 to -15 degree
range on Thursday morning and again on Friday morning.
