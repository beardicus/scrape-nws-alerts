<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 31 at 11:14AM EST until February 04 at 1:00AM EST by NWS NorthernIndiana</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY MORNING
THROUGH LATE THURSDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation and heavy snow possible.
Total snow accumulations of 2 to 6 inches and ice
accumulations of around one tenth of an inch possible. Winds
could gust as high as 30 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of northern Indiana and northwest Ohio.
* WHEN...From Wednesday morning through late Thursday night.
* IMPACTS...Travel will likely become very difficult to
impossible. Widespread blowing snow will likely significantly
reduce visibility with large snow drifts over open areas
Thursday. The hazardous conditions will effect midweek
commutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A major winter storm is anticipated.
Widespread disruptions of travel and commerce are expected
starting Tuesday night and persisting through at least
Thursday. Wind chill temperatures will be in the single digits
Thursday and below zero Thursday night.</description>
<instruction>This storm will bring potentially dangerous winter weather early
Wednesday through Thursday. Unplowed roads are likely to become
impassable over most areas. Plummeting wind chills accompanied by
blowing and drifting snow could bring a potentially lethal travel
situation if you become stuck in your vehicle Thursday through
Thursday night. Plan now to make any needed travel changes to
avoid travel during this time. Monitor the latest forecasts for
updates on this developing major winter storm.</instruction>
