<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM THIS
EVENING TO 9 PM AKST TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Snow mixing with sleet, with the potential for freezing
rain. Total snow and sleet accumulations of up to 6 inches and
ice accumulations up to one tenth of an inch. East to
Northeast winds 15 to 30 with gusts as high as 40 mph
especially along the coast.
* WHERE...Kuskokwim Delta.
* WHEN...From 9 PM Monday to 9 PM AKST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on difficult travel conditions. Areas of
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...There remains uncertainty as to the depth
of warm air that moves into the area. As a result, this will
impact the expected snowfall amounts. More mixing will result
in less snowfall amounts and less mixing will result in higher
snowfall amounts. Also, the deeper the warm air, then more
freezing rain may be possible.</description>
