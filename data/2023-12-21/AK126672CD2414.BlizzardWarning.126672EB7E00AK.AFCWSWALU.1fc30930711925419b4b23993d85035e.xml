<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON FRIDAY TO 3 PM
AKST SATURDAY FOR THE BRISTOL BAY COAST...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions expected. Total snow accumulations
of 4 to 9 inches. Visibility of one quarter mile or less at
times. North wind gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Bristol Bay coast, including Port Heiden and from
Dillingham west to Goodnews Bay.
* WHEN...From noon Friday to 3 PM AKST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on difficult travel conditions. Areas of
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Port Heiden will see the longest duration
of blizzard conditions. Dillingham, which will be near the
eastern edge of the snow band, may see a shorter duration of
blizzard conditions if the snow band moves westward more
quickly. Easterly gusts as high as 45 mph are possible around
Iliamna Lake on Friday night, but no snow or blowing snow is
expected for this area.</description>
<instruction>A Blizzard Warning means severe winter weather conditions are
expected or occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds
and poor visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout
conditions, making travel very hazardous. If you must travel,
have a winter survival kit with you.If you get stranded, stay
with your vehicle.</instruction>
