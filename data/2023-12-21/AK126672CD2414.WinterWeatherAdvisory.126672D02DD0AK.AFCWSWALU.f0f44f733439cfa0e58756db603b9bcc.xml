<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON AKST
FRIDAY FOR THE EASTERN ALEUTIANS...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 2 to 6
inches. Visibility of one half mile or less at times. Winds
gusting as high as 60 mph.
* WHERE...Eastern Aleutians, including the communities of
Nikolski, Unalaska, and Akutan.
* WHEN...From noon today to noon AKST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on difficult travel conditions. Areas of
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. Strong
winds could cause damage.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Light to moderate snow and blowing snow are
expected as a front moves west to east across the Eastern
Aleutians. Temperatures warmed into the mid 30s Thursday
afternoon, thus the onset of snow and blowing will be delayed
until later tonight when temperatures begin to fall again.
Confidence continues to be lower for snow amounts and whether
snow will be transportable enough to significantly reduce
visibility, especially near sea level.</description>
