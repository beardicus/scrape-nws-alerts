<headline>Flood Watch issued November 05 at 4:12PM AST until November 07 at 6:00PM AST by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...All of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.
* WHEN...Through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water crossings may be
flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A strong mid to upper level trough centered north of
Hispaniola, along with abundant moisture arriving from the
Caribbean Sea has resulted in widespread showers and
thunderstorms. The soils are saturated and rivers are running
high, so urban, river and flash floods are likely to
continue. Additionally, several mudslides have been reported.
Over 5 inches of rain have been reported in Ponce, and 2 to 5
across southern Puerto Rico. These episodes of continuous
rainfall will continue today and tomorrow.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action
should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.</instruction>
