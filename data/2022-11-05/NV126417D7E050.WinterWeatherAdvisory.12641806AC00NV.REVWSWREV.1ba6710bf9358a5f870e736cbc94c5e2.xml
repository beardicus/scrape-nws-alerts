<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued November 05 at 9:32PM PST until November 09 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT FROM 10 PM SUNDAY TO
4 AM PST WEDNESDAY...
* CHANGES...Extended the Winter Weather Advisory through Wednesday
morning.
* WHAT...Snow expected. Storm total snow accumulations up to 4
inches, except 4 to 7 inches above 5000 feet. Locally higher
totals are possible in the foothills west of Highway 395 and
south of US-50. Winds gusting as high as 50-60 mph in wind
prone areas early Monday.
* WHERE...Greater Reno-Carson City-Minden Area.
* WHEN...From 10 PM Sunday to 4 AM PST Wednesday. Burst of snow
possible Monday morning, followed by a break until the next more
robust round of snow on midday Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning commutes. Gusty winds could
bring down tree branches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS... While there may be breaks in snowfall
during the advisory period, hazardous road conditions may
persist as cold temperatures will help to refreeze wet road
surfaces.</description>
<instruction>Even light snowfall causes major travel delays, especially during
periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to
reach your destination. Leave extra space between vehicles since
it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
