<description>...A STRONG EARLY WINTER STORM WILL BRING GUSTY WINDS, SNOWFALL,
AND MUCH COLDER TEMPERATURES THIS UPCOMING WEEK...
* GUSTY WINDS: Winds will increase Sunday afternoon and evening
with gusts 35 to 45 mph and gusts of 50 to 60 mph in wind prone
locations. The strongest winds will be during the early morning
hours on Monday. Impacts from winds include road travel
restrictions due to cross winds especially for high profile
vehicles, aviation turbulence, hazardous boating conditions, and
patchy blowing dust downwind of dry lake beds and sinks. Wind
impacts will diminish by Tuesday.
* SNOW IMPACTS: Snow is forecast to begin pushing into the western
Nevada Basin and Range during the morning hours on Monday which
may impact the AM commute. Additional light snowfall and much
colder temperatures are possible through Wednesday morning, so
be prepared for a few days of icy-slick roads next week. Through
Wednesday, storm total snowfall up to 2 inches, with up to 4
inches above 5000 feet.
* COLD TEMPERATURES: Temperatures will plummet after the frontal
passage on Monday. Daytime highs in the upper 30s to low 40s
across much of western Nevada with lows dropping into the 20s
and teens across the region. This cold airmass will hang around
through the remainder of the work week.</description>
