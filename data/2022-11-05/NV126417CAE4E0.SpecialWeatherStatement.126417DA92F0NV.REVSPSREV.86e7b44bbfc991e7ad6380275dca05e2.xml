<description>...A STRONG EARLY WINTER STORM WILL BRING GUSTY WINDS, SNOWFALL, AND
MUCH COLDER TEMPERATURES NEXT WEEK...
* GUSTY WINDS: Winds will increase Sunday afternoon and evening
with gusts 35 to 45 mph in the valleys and gusts of 50 to 60 mph
in wind prone locations. Sierra ridge-top gusts may reach 100+
mph. Impacts from winds include road travel restrictions due to
cross winds especially for high profile vehicles, aviation
turbulence, hazardous boating conditions, and patchy blowing
dust downwind of dry lake beds and sinks. Wind impacts will
diminish by Tuesday.
* SNOW IMPACTS: Snow is forecast to impact the western Nevada
valleys late Sunday night into Monday morning which may lead to
travel challenges during the Monday morning commute. Snow totals
of 1 to 4 inches are possible with locally higher amounts in
foothills west of Highway 395 and the Virginia Highlands.
Additional light snowfall and much colder temperatures are
possible through Wednesday morning, so be prepared for a few
days of icy-slick roads next week.
* COLD TEMPERATURES: Mild high temperatures this weekend will drop
15-20 degrees by Tuesday. Daytime highs will struggle to reach
the 30s in the Sierra valleys and 40s across much of western
Nevada. Overnight lows may drop into the 10s and 20s across
western NV valleys with single digit and sub-zero lows possible
in the Sierra valleys.</description>
