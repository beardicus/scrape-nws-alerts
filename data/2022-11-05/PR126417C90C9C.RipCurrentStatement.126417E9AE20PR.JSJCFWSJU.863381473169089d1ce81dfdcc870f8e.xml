<headline>Rip Current Statement issued November 05 at 5:15AM ADT until November 07 at 7:00PM ADT by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH
MONDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Breaking wave heights around 6 feet may cause strong
sweeping currents along coastlines.
* WHERE...Beaches of Culebra.
* WHEN...From Sunday Morning through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Inexperienced swimmers may become in danger if
caught in these currents.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.</instruction>
