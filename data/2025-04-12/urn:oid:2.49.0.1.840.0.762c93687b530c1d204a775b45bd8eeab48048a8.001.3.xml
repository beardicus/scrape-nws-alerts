        <headline>Red Flag Warning issued April 12 at 1:59AM MDT until April 12 at 8:00PM MDT by NWS Albuquerque NM</headline>
        <description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT SATURDAY BETWEEN 1PM AND 8PM FOR
THE NORTHEAST HIGHLANDS AND PLAINS, WEST CENTRAL NM, AND THE
UPPER RIO GRANDE AND LOWER CHAMA RIVER VALLEYS DUE TO STRONG
WINDS, LOW HUMIDITY AND HIGH FIRE DANGER...

...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT SUNDAY BETWEEN 10AM AND 8PM FOR
THE UPPER RIO GRANDE AND LOWER CHAMA RIVER VALLEYS, WEST CENTRAL
NM, AND ALL AREAS ALONG AND EAST OF THE CENTRAL MOUNTAIN CHAIN
DUE TO STRONG WINDS, LOW HUMIDITY AND HIGH FIRE DANGER...

.Well above normal temperatures, very low humidity, strengthening
west-southwest winds, and high fire danger will lead to critical
fire weather conditions this afternoon and evening. High
temperatures will be 15 to 25 degrees above normal with 6 to 12
hours of single digit humidity expected. Strongest winds are
expected across northeast New Mexico. More critical fire weather
conditions are expected Sunday as above normal temperatures with
exceptionally dry conditions persist. In general, winds will be a
little stronger than on Saturday. In sparse areas, fuels may have
begun to green up after the rain and snow last weekend, which
would mitigate the potential for rapid fire spread.

The National Weather Service in Albuquerque has issued a Red Flag
Warning...which is in effect from 1 PM this afternoon to 8 PM MDT
this evening. A Fire Weather Watch has also been issued. This
Fire Weather Watch is in effect from Sunday morning through
Sunday evening.

* AREA AND TIMING...This includes the West Central Basin and Range
(Zone 109) between 1 pm and 8 pm today and again Sunday morning
through Sunday evening.

* 20 FOOT WINDS...West to southwest winds 15 to 25 mph with gusts
near 35 mph today and west to southwest 20 to 30 mph with gusts
up to 40 mph on Sunday.

* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...Minimum values between 3 and 6 percent today
and between 5 and 8 percent Sunday.

* IMPACTS...Any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly.
Outdoor burning is not recommended.
