<description>...SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE THIS WEEK...
* Scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms will develop
each afternoon this week and could become strong to severe
today. Storms today will be capable of producing strong outflow
winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and frequent cloud to ground
lightning.
* If you have events or recreation outdoors this week, be sure to
have a storm safety plan. A top priority should be a way to
quickly seek shelter in the event that a thunderstorm forms
nearby. If a sturdy building is not immediately available, a
hard-top vehicle with the windows rolled up is a good option for
protection from lightning. If possible, consider completing
outdoor activities (hiking, biking, etc) in the morning before
afternoon/evening thunderstorms develop.
* Streams and mainstem rivers continue to flow fast and cold.
Avoid recreating near fast-running and nearly full waterways.
Daily showers/thunderstorms will increase the threat of flash
flooding. Have a way to receive weather alerts! Get to higher
ground immediately if a nearby river or stream rises quickly, if
there is debris in the water, or if the water suddenly becomes
muddy.</description>
