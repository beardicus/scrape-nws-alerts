At 901 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing heavy
rain over the Cerro Pelado Burn Scar have diminished and rainfall
rates have decreased. However, at least light rain will persist this
evening over the area. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to
begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will impact Canada Camada,
Peralta Canyon, Bland Canyon, Rio Chiquito, Tent Rocks National
Monument, Cochiti Pueblo, and Cochiti Golf Club. The debris flow can
consist of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms producing
flash flooding in and around the Cerro Pelado Burn Scar.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Life threatening flash flooding of areas in and around
the Cerro Pelado Burn Scar.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Cochiti Pueblo and Pena Blanca.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>Runoff from rainfall will cause elevated water levels within
vulnerable drainages in and downstream of the Cerro Pelado fire burn
area.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Do not camp along streams and rivers. Remain alert when hiking in
steep, narrow canyons. Know where you are relative to low spots and
drainages.
This is a life threatening situation. Heavy rainfall will cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks, streams and ditches
in the Cerro Pelado Burn Scar. Severe debris flows can also be
anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may be washed away in
places. If you encounter flood waters, climb to safety.</instruction>
