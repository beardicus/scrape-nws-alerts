<headline>Flood Watch issued June 06 at 10:09AM MDT  by NWS Billings</headline>
<description>.Scattered thunderstorms are expected to form this afternoon and
continue through late tonight. These storms will form in a very
moist airmass and will move slowly resulting in locally very heavy
rainfall. Given the saturated soils from recent rainfall, any
precipitation will run off quickly resulting in high potential for
flash flooding near any thunderstorms.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of central and south central Montana, including
the following areas, in central Montana, Golden Valley, Judith
Gap, Musselshell and Southern Wheatland. In south central Montana,
Beartooth Foothills, Crazy Mountains, Melville Foothills, Northern
Carbon, Northern Stillwater, Northern Sweet Grass, Red Lodge
Foothills and Southwestern Yellowstone.
* WHEN...Through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water
crossings may be flooded. Storm drains and ditches may become
clogged with debris flooding and damaging roads, especially
unpaved rural roads.
Flash flooding and debris flows are possible in and near area burn
scars including the American Fork, BobCat, Peterson, and Robertson
Draw burn areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Scattered slow moving thunderstorms will produce very heavy
rainfall this afternoon through late tonight. Soils are
saturated from recent heavy rainfall, and thus any
precipitation will run off quickly resulting in high
potential for flash flooding near any thunderstorms.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action
should Flash Flood Warnings be issued. Have a plan to get to a safe
location on higher ground if you are in a flood prone location.</instruction>
