<headline>Flood Watch issued June 06 at 2:21PM MDT until June 06 at 11:45PM MDT by NWS Glasgow</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH LATE FRIDAY
NIGHT...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of northeast Montana, including the following
areas, Central and Southeast Phillips, Garfield, Northern
Phillips, Petroleum and Southwest Phillips.
* WHEN...From Thursday afternoon through late Friday night.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A weather system approaching the region will lead to
increasing thunderstorms Thursday afternoon through Friday
night. These storms will be capable of producing heavy
rainfall over a short period of time. Since soils are already
saturated from recent rainfall, these storms will lead to
increased risk of localized flash flooding.

should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.</instruction>
