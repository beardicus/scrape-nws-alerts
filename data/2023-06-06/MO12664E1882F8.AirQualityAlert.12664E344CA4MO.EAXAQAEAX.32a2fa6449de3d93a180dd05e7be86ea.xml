<description>...Air Quality Alert in effect for Wednesday June 07...
The Mid-America Regional Council has issued an Air Quality Alert...in
effect for Wednesday June 07. Outdoor Air Quality Index, or AQI,
values in excess of 100 are expected with ozone being the primary
pollutant.
People and businesses are urged to avoid activities which lead to
ozone formation. These activities include refueling vehicles or
topping off when refueling idling vehicles unnecessarily and using
gasoline powered lawn equipment. Positive activities include car
pooling, biking to work, delaying or combining errands, and using
water-based paints and cleaners.
When pollution levels are elevated, the Mid-America Regional Council
recommends that individuals consider limiting strenuous outdoor
physical activity to reduce the risk of adverse health effects.
People who may be especially sensitive to the effects of elevated
levels of pollutants include the very young, and those with pre-
existing respiratory problems such as asthma or heart disease. Those
with symptoms should consider consulting their personal physician.
