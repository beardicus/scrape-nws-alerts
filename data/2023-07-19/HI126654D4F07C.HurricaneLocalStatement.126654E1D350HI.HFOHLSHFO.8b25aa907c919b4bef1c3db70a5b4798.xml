SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Calvin has become a post-tropical cyclone, and therefore have
discontinued all Tropical Storm Warnings for the Big Island. Calvin
will continue tracking away to the west this afternoon and tonight
with a decreasing trend for rainfall, wind and east shore surf.
Breezy trade winds will continue around the islands due to the
pressure difference between Calvin and the subtropical high to the
north and northeast. A Wind Advisory will remain in effect for the
rest of the day, with winds likely falling below advisory criteria
by this evening. Trades will usher in scattered showers focused over
windward areas, occasionally spilling over to leeward sides of the
islands. A Flood Watch remains in effect through this afternoon with
additional rainfall expected up to 2 inches maximum statewide.
A High Surf Advisory remains in effect through this afternoon for
east facing shores of Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui and Big Island. The
threat of coastal impacts from surf and storm surge will lower
quickly this afternoon for all areas.
NEXT UPDATE
-----------
As it pertains to this event...this will be the last local statement
issued by the National Weather Service in Honolulu HI regarding the
effects of tropical cyclone hazards upon the area.</description>
