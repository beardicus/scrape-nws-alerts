at 30 mph.
HAZARD...Tornado and quarter size hail.
SOURCE...Radar indicated rotation.

to roofs, windows, and vehicles will occur.  Tree damage is
likely.

<instruction>TAKE COVER NOW! Move to a basement or an interior room on the lowest
floor of a sturdy building. Avoid windows. If you are outdoors, in a
mobile home, or in a vehicle, move to the closest substantial shelter
and protect yourself from flying debris.
If on or near Lower Red Lake, get away from the water and move to
safe shelter immediately. If you can hear thunder, you are close
enough to be struck by lightning. Severe thunderstorms can produce
large capsizing waves, even on small bodies of water. Move into dock
and seek safe shelter now! Do not be caught on the water in a
thunderstorm.
Torrential rainfall is occurring with this storm, and may lead to
flash flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flooded roadways.</instruction>
