<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 AM PDT FRIDAY...
The North Coast Unified Air Quality Management District has issued
an Air Quality Alert in effect until 11 AM PDT Friday.
Due to smoke from the Six Rivers Lightning Complex Fires, the North
Coast Unified Air Quality Management District has issued an Air
Quality Alert for western Trinity and northeast Humboldt counties
until 11 AM Friday. This includes Burnt Ranch, Salyer and Hawkins
Bar in Trinity county as well as Willow Creek in Humboldt county.
An Air Quality Alert means that air quality will be hazardous for
all groups of people. Everyone in these areas should limit the amount
of time they spend outdoors as much as possible. Keep windows closed,
do not run house fans that bring outside air indoors. Consider
leaving the area until smoke conditions improve if you have repeated
coughing, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, wheezing, chest
tightness or pain, palpitations, nausea, unusual fatigue, or
lightheadedness.
Please visit the North Coast Unified Air Quality Management District
website at www.ncuaqd.org to access the current air quality alert
for your specific location. Smoke concentration levels will likely
fluctuate during the next 24 hours and may become hazardous for short
periods of time in other locations not included in the alert.</description>
