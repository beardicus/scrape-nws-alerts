<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 18 at 8:03PM EDT until August 19 at 12:45AM EDT by NWS Charleston</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of southeast South Carolina, including the
following counties, Beaufort and Jasper.
* WHEN...Until 1100 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 757 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms. Minor flooding is ongoing or expected to begin
shortly in the advisory area.
- An area of torrential rainfall is impacting portions of
Beaufort and Jasper counties, primarily around Beaufort,
Burton, Laurel Bay, and surrounding locations. Radar data
estimates that 2 to 4 inches of rain has fallen since
approximately 5:30 pm. This is supported by a few rain gauge
observations around Ridgeland indicating 3 to 4 inches fell
in 2 to 3 hours. The heaviest rain is now spreading into the
downtown Beaufort and minor flooding can be expected around
the area. Area roadways could become flooded due to deep
ponding of water, making travel hazardous. Additional
rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches will be possible through
the late evening hours.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Beaufort, Port Royal, Ridgeland, Clarendon, Laurel Bay,
Beaufort Marine Corps Air Station, Burton, Shell Point, Dale,
Lemon Island, Ladys Island, Old House, Parris Island,
Grahamville, Chesterfield, Grays Hill, Lobeco, Beaufort
Memorial Hospital, Edwards Burton Rodgers Bridge and Walling
Grove.</description>
