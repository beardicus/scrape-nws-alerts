<description>...TROPICAL FUNNEL CLOUD SIGHTED...
At 105 PM...The National Weather Service has received a report of
a funnel cloud (and possibly a land spout) in the vicinity of
Johnson`s Bayou in coastal Cameron Parish.
A very moist and unstable tropical airmass is in place across
the area. Meanwhile...the vertical wind profile over the area
is light and variable. These conditions are favorable for the
development of tropical funnel clouds...especially where rain
cooled boundaries...known as outflow boundaries...and the
seabreeze collide.
These tropical funnel clouds are usually short-lived and do not
reach the ground. If the funnel cloud becomes more severe and
reaches the ground...minor damage may occur...and a tornado
warning will likely be issued.
Stay tuned for later statements and updates on this weather
situation.</description>
