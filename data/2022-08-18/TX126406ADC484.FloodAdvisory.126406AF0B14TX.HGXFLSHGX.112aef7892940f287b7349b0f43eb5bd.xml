<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 18 at 3:09AM CDT until further notice by NWS Houston - Galveston</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in League City has issued a
* Flood Advisory for...
Central Polk County in southeastern Texas...
* Until 515 AM CDT.
* At 308 AM CDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to nearly
stationary showers and thunderstorms. This will cause minor
flooding in the advisory area. Up to two to three inches of rain
are estimated to have already fallen, and an additional two to
four inches are possible if activity remains nearly stationary.
* Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Onalaska, Corrigan, Seven Oaks, northwestern West Livingston,
Leggett and Moscow.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
A Flood Advisory means river or stream flows are elevated, or ponding
of water in urban or other areas is occurring or is imminent.</instruction>
