<headline>Flood Watch issued August 18 at 9:25AM MST until August 18 at 4:30PM MST by NWS Flagstaff</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY MORNING THROUGH
SATURDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of east central Arizona, north central Arizona
and northeast Arizona, including the following areas, in east
central Arizona, Northern Gila County. In north central Arizona,
Eastern Mogollon Rim and Little Colorado River Valley in Coconino
County. In northeast Arizona, Chuska Mountains and Defiance
Plateau, Little Colorado River Valley in Apache County, Little
Colorado River Valley in Navajo County, Northeast Plateaus and
Mesas South of Hwy 264 and White Mountains.
* WHEN...From Friday morning through Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...Flash flooding will be possible in creeks, normally dry
washes, swimming holes and over recently burned areas. Low-water
crossings could also experience flash flooding, which would create
deadly travel conditions. Consider changing your plans if you were
going to hike, boat, or paddleboard to a slot canyon or normally
dry wash. If you do still decide to recreate, check in at a nearby
visitor center or ranger station.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A westerly moving area of low pressure will enhance the
probability of heavy rain and subsequent flash flooding over
portions of northern Arizona from Friday through Saturday
evening over areas that have already had significant rainfall
over the past week.

flood safety.</description>
