<description>...MENDENHALL LAKE AND RIVER LEVELS REMAIN HIGH...
Water levels along the Mendenhall Lake and Mendenhall River in
Juneau continue to slowly rise due to heavy rainfall earlier in the
week. Lake levels are expected to crest by mid morning just below 9
feet, and a slow fall is expected through the day on Friday as no
additional precipitation is forecast for the area.
People living along the lake and river, and anyone recreating on the
river should use caution and stay alert to any additional changes in
water levels. When the lake level is near 8 feet, Nugget Falls trail
sees some flooding. Along the Mendenhall River, these increased
water levels and faster flows result in bank erosion and dangerous
tree-fall along the river.</description>
