<headline>Flood Watch issued August 18 at 9:25AM MST  by NWS Flagstaff</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON MST TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of north central Arizona, including the
following areas, Grand Canyon Country, Kaibab Plateau and Marble
and Glen Canyons.
* WHEN...From Noon MST today through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...Flash flooding will be possible in creeks, normally dry
washes, swimming holes and over recently burned areas. Low-water
crossings could also experience flash flooding, which would create
deadly travel conditions. Consider changing your plans if you were
going to hike, boat, or paddleboard to a slot canyon or normally
dry wash. If you do still decide to recreate, check in at a nearby
visitor center or ranger station.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A westerly moving area of low pressure will enhance the
probability of heavy rain and subsequent flash flooding over
portions of northern Arizona from Friday through Saturday
evening over areas that have already had significant rainfall
over the past week.
- Visit www.weather.gov/safety/flood for more information on
flood safety.</description>
