<description>...PERIODS OF RAINFALL WILL CONTINUE ACROSS SOUTHCENTRAL THROUGH
SATURDAY...
Additional storm systems will move across Southcentral Alaska
through the first half of the weekend. Widespread rain is
expected Thursday evening through Friday morning, and again Friday
evening into Saturday morning.
Expected additional rainfall amounts through Saturday:
Anchorage Bowl: 0.75&quot; to 1.0&quot;
This additional rain could push small streams and creeks to, or
slightly above, bankfull. Smaller rivers could see water levels
rise to bankfull, however water levels along larger rivers are
expected to remain below bankfull.
In urban areas, ponding of water and localized flooding on poorly
drained roadways is also possible. Please use caution when
driving or when recreating along or on area waterways.
