<headline>Flood Watch issued August 18 at 2:51AM MST until August 18 at 4:00AM MST by NWS Flagstaff</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON MST TODAY THROUGH
SATURDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of northern Arizona including the Coconino
Plateau and Western Mogollon Rim.
* WHEN...From Noon MST today through Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...Flash flooding will be possible in creeks, normally dry
washes, swimming holes and over recently burned areas. Low-water
crossings could also experience flash flooding, which would create
deadly travel conditions. Consider changing your plans if you were
going to hike, boat, or paddleboard to a slot canyon or normally
dry wash. If you do still decide to recreate, check in at a nearby
visitor center or ranger station.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A westerly moving area of low pressure will enhance the
probability of heavy rain over portions of northern Arizona
from this afternoon through Saturday evening over areas that
have already had significant rainfall over the past week.
- Visit www.weather.gov/safety/flood for more information on
flood safety.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action
should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.</instruction>
