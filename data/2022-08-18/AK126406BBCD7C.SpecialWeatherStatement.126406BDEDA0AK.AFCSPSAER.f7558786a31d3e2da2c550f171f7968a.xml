<description>...PERIODS OF RAINFALL WILL CONTINUE ACROSS SOUTHCENTRAL THROUGH
SATURDAY...
An upper low slowly moving into Southcentral continues to pump
Gulf moisture into the region with numerous showers lifting into
the Anchorage Bowl. As the low makes further eastward progress,
southwest flow ahead of the low, and up Cook Inlet, will bring
additional moisture and showers Friday into Saturday.
Expected additional rainfall amounts through Saturday:
Anchorage Bowl: 0.50&quot; to 0.75&quot;
This additional rain could push small streams and creeks to, or
slightly above, bankfull. Smaller rivers could see water levels
rise to bankfull; however, water levels along larger rivers are
expected to remain below bankfull.
In urban areas, ponding of water and localized flooding on poorly
drained roadways is also possible. Please use caution when
driving or when recreating along or on area waterways.
