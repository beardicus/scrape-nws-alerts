<headline>Tropical Storm Warning issued May 24 at 9:08AM ChST until further notice by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...CATEGORY 4 TYPHOON MAWAR CONTINUES A SLOW APPROACH TOWARDS GUAM...
Corrected details in Guam inland flooding section
.NEW INFORMATION...
None.
.AREAS AFFECTED...
This local statement provides important information and recommended
actions for people in Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan. Guam will see
the devastating impacts from Mawar.
.Watches/Warnings...
A Typhoon Warning continues for the Guam and Rota. Damaging winds of
39 mph are occurring. Typhoon force winds of 74 mph or greater are
expected later this morning.
A Tropical Storm Warning and a Typhoon Watch continues for Tinian and
Saipan.
A Flood Watch is in effect for Guam and the Northern Marianas. Please
listen closely for any Flood Warnings that might be in effect for
your area.
.STORM INFORMATION...
At 8 AM ChST...the eye of Cat 4 Typhoon Mawar (02W) was located near
latitude 12.8N...longitude 145.7E based on a PGUA radar fix. This was
about 75 miles southeast of Guam. Storm motion was towards the north-
west at 6 mph. Storm intensity is currently 140 mph.
.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
Mawar continues its approach towards Guam. Passage very near or
directly over Guam is imminent. The latest forecast from the Joint
Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) indicates that Mawar may strengthen
slightly on approach to Guam with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph,
with gusts approaching 175 mph at landfall. This is expected to
occur over the next few hours, prior to making landfall.
The triple threats of Cat 4 Typhoon Mawar are, torrential rains that
may result in landslides and flash flooding, catastrophic wind, and
life-threatening storm surge. This is expected for Guam, with
potently catastrophic coastal flooding for southeastern and southern
portions of Guam if a southern Guam or Cocos passage is realized. A
mandatory evacuation order was initiated by the governor of Guam
yesterday. Storm surge potential is extreme, please see the storm
surge and surf info below, as a large storm surge and coastal impacts
are expected, particularly for coastal areas just north of the eye
of Typhoon Mawar on the east to southeast sides of Guam. Guam and the
CNMI are all in COR 1 by their respective governors.
.PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
All preparations for the protection of life and property should now
be complete. You should be in a fully-reinforced concrete structure,
especially on Guam.
During the storm...stay inside and away from windows. Do not venture
outside when high winds are occurring or during temporary lulls as
flying debris can easily, and suddenly, cause serious injury. If the
eye passes over you on Guam, extreme winds will suddenly cease. This
is not the end of the typhoon. REMAIN IN SHELTER as extreme winds
will rapidly resume.
Have a well-charged cell phone nearby, keeping network communications
as open as possible for emergencies.
Once conditions have improved, remain in shelter until the all-clear,
COR 4, is announced from government officials.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for the latest forecasts.
&amp;&amp;
.NEXT UPDATE...
The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather
Service in Tiyan around 3 PM...or sooner if conditions warrant.
...TROPICAL STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...TYPHOON WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IS NOW IN EFFECT...
...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
IT`S TOO LATE to make any further preparations. Comply with any
evacuation orders. Shelter in place until the local governments
gives the &quot;all clear&quot; and conditions are raised to TCOR 4.
&amp;&amp;
...Winds...
East to northeast winds will become damaging around noontime with
winds in the 30 to 40 mph range with gusts to around 55 mph. Higher
winds are likely for elevated terrain such as Capitol Hill. Winds are
forecast to increase through the day as they shift to an easterly
then southeasterly direction. Typhoon conditions are still possible,
but this hinges on a northward drift with Typhoon Mawar.
Power outages are possible. Corrugated metal and plywood could be
stripped from poorly constructed homes. Wooden power poles could
be tilted. Poorly constructed signs could be damaged. Banana,
papaya and fleshy crops could see damage.
...Storm surge and storm tide...
Storm surge of 1 to 3 ft above the normal high tide is expected along
south and eastern shores. Coastal erosion is possible but not
expected to be significant. There could be minor to moderate pier
damage for coastal areas exposed to the south and east. Large boats
could still be torn from moorings. Moderate damage is possible.
Surf will build sharply today along south and east facing reefs with
dangerous surf of 8 to 15 feet building to 15 to to 20 feet.
Hazardous surf is likely to spread to west facing reefs Friday as
Mawar moves west into the Philippine Sea.
...Inland flooding...
A Flood Watch is in effect for Saipan and Tinian. Listen for possible
flood warnings...and be ready to act if flooding rains occur.
Heavy rainfall is possible through Thursday with rainfall amounts
of 3 to 5 inches. This is most likely if Mawar`s outer rainbands
train overhead today.</description>
