<description>...CATEGORY 4 TYPHOON MAWAR JUST NORTH OF GUAM...
.AREAS AFFECTED...
This local statement provides important information and
recommended actions for people in Guam and the Northern Marianas.
.Watches/Warnings...
A Typhoon Warning continues for Guam and Rota. Typhoon force
winds of 74 mph or greater are occurring over Guam and could spread
to Rota later this afternoon with a slight northward shift of Mawar.
A Tropical Storm Warning and a Typhoon Watch continue for Saipan and
Tinian.
A Flood Watch is in effect for Guam and the Northern Marianas. Please
listen closely for any Flood Warnings that might be in effect for
your area.
.STORM INFORMATION...
At 7 PM ChST...the center of Typhoon Mawar (02W) was located near
latitude 13.7N...longitude 144.9E. This was about 15 miles north-
northeast of Guam. Storm motion was northwest at 8 mph. Storm
intensity was 140 mph.
.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
Mawar`s southern eyewall is pivoting over Guam this evening. Typhoon
force winds and torrential rain persist. Considerable wind damage to
buildings of light material is occurring along with localized flash
flooding and the possibility of landslides. Significant coastal
erosion is likely, particularly along western shorelines.
.PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
You should be in a fully-reinforced concrete structure, especially on
Guam.
Stay inside and away from windows. Do not venture outside when high
winds are occurring or during temporary lulls as flying debris can
easily, and suddenly, cause serious injury.
Have a well-charged cell phone nearby, keeping network communications
as open as possible for emergencies.
Once conditions have improved, remain in shelter until the all-clear,
COR 4, is announced from government officials.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for the latest forecasts.
&amp;&amp;
.NEXT UPDATE...
The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather
Service in Tiyan around 3 AM...or sooner if conditions warrant.
...TROPICAL STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...TYPHOON WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IS NOW IN EFFECT...
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT...
...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Shelter in place until the local governments gives the &quot;all clear&quot;
and conditions are raised to TCOR 4.
&amp;&amp;
...Winds...
East winds of 40 to 55 mph are expected late this evening and
overnight. Higher winds and gusts are expected for elevated terrain
such as Capitol Hill. Typhoon conditions are not expected, however,
outer rainbands may bring typhoon force gusts (60-70 mph) at times.
Power outages are possible. Corrugated metal and plywood could be
stripped from poorly constructed homes. Wooden power poles could
be tilted. Poorly constructed signs could be damaged. Banana,
papaya and fleshy crops could be damaged or topple.
...Storm surge and storm tide...
Storm surge up to 3 ft above the normal high tide is expected along
south and eastern shores. Coastal erosion is possible, but not
expected to be significant. There could be minor to moderate pier
damage for coastal areas exposed to the south and east. Large boats
could still be torn from moorings. Moderate damage is possible.
Dangerous surf of 10 and 20 feet is likely for south and east facing
reefs. Hazardous surf is likely to spread to west facing reefs Friday
as Mawar moves west into the Philippine Sea.
...Inland flooding...
A Flood Watch is in effect for Saipan and Tinian. Listen for possible
flood warnings...and be ready to act if flooding rains occur.
Heavy rainfall is possible through Thursday with rainfall amounts
of 2 to 4 inches. This is most likely if Mawar`s outer rainbands
train overhead tonight.</description>
