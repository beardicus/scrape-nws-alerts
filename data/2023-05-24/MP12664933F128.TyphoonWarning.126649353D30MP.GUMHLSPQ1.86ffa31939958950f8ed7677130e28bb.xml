<description>...CATEGORY 4 TYPHOON MAWAR JUST NORTH OF GUAM...
.AREAS AFFECTED...
This local statement provides important information and
recommended actions for people in Guam and the Northern Marianas.
.Watches/Warnings...
A Typhoon Warning continues for Guam and Rota. Typhoon force
winds of 74 mph or greater are occurring over Guam and could spread
to Rota later this afternoon with a slight northward shift of Mawar.
A Tropical Storm Warning and a Typhoon Watch continue for Saipan and
Tinian.
A Flood Watch is in effect for Guam and the Northern Marianas. Please
listen closely for any Flood Warnings that might be in effect for
your area.
.STORM INFORMATION...
At 7 PM ChST...the center of Typhoon Mawar (02W) was located near
latitude 13.7N...longitude 144.9E. This was about 15 miles north-
northeast of Guam. Storm motion was northwest at 8 mph. Storm
intensity was 140 mph.
.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
Mawar`s southern eyewall is pivoting over Guam this evening. Typhoon
force winds and torrential rain persist. Considerable wind damage to
buildings of light material is occurring along with localized flash
flooding and the possibility of landslides. Significant coastal
erosion is likely, particularly along western shorelines.
.PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
You should be in a fully-reinforced concrete structure, especially on
Guam.
Stay inside and away from windows. Do not venture outside when high
winds are occurring or during temporary lulls as flying debris can
easily, and suddenly, cause serious injury.
Have a well-charged cell phone nearby, keeping network communications
as open as possible for emergencies.
Once conditions have improved, remain in shelter until the all-clear,
COR 4, is announced from government officials.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for the latest forecasts.
&amp;&amp;
.NEXT UPDATE...
The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather
Service in Tiyan around 3 AM...or sooner if conditions warrant.
...TYPHOON WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT...
...New Information...
Mawar`s center pivoted around northern Guam. All available data and
the latest JTWC position has Mawar centered 13.7N latitude 144.9E
longitude, just north of Ritidian Point on Guam.
...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Residents should remain in shelter within sturdy concrete homes with
concrete roofs, or wherever you are.
Again, once conditions have improved sometime late Thursday or
Friday, remain in shelter until the all-clear, Cor 4, is given by
government officials.
&amp;&amp;
...Winds...
Strong tropical storm force conditions may brush to typhoon force
levels tonight. Easterly winds will shift southeast Thursday morning.
Corrugated metal and plywood may be stripped from poorly constructed
buildings and become airborne. Wooden power poles which are rotten or
not reinforced could be tilted or even broken. Poorly constructed
signs could become damaged. Banana, papaya and other similar crops
are likely to topple.
...Storm surge and storm tide...
Storm surge of 3 to 5 feet above the normal high tide is expected as
Mawar passes near northern Guam tonight. Large boats could be torn
from moorings. Moderate coastal erosion and reef damage is likely,
particularly along southeast to eastern reefs. Moderate damage is
possible.
Surf of 10 to 20 feet is expected along south and east facing reefs
tonight. Hazardous surf is likely to spread to west facing reefs
Friday or Saturday as Mawar moves west into the Philippine Sea.
...Inland flooding...
A Flood Watch is in effect for Rota. Listen for possible flood
warnings for your location, and be ready to act if flooding rains
occur.
Heavy rainfall may develop tonight and continue through Thursday
morning. Rainfall amounts of 5 to 8 inches are possible with locally
higher amounts. Monitor conditions for possible flood advisories or
warnings.</description>
