<description>...CATEGORY 4 TYPHOON MAWAR JUST NORTH OF GUAM...
.AREAS AFFECTED...
This local statement provides important information and
recommended actions for people in Guam and the Northern Marianas.
.Watches/Warnings...
A Typhoon Warning continues for Guam and Rota. Typhoon force
winds of 74 mph or greater are occurring over Guam and could spread
to Rota later this afternoon with a slight northward shift of Mawar.
A Tropical Storm Warning and a Typhoon Watch continue for Saipan and
Tinian.
A Flood Watch is in effect for Guam and the Northern Marianas. Please
listen closely for any Flood Warnings that might be in effect for
your area.
.STORM INFORMATION...
At 7 PM ChST...the center of Typhoon Mawar (02W) was located near
latitude 13.7N...longitude 144.9E. This was about 15 miles north-
northeast of Guam. Storm motion was northwest at 8 mph. Storm
intensity was 140 mph.
.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
Mawar`s southern eyewall is pivoting over Guam this evening. Typhoon
force winds and torrential rain persist. Considerable wind damage to
buildings of light material is occurring along with localized flash
flooding and the possibility of landslides. Significant coastal
erosion is likely, particularly along western shorelines.
.PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
You should be in a fully-reinforced concrete structure, especially on
Guam.
Stay inside and away from windows. Do not venture outside when high
winds are occurring or during temporary lulls as flying debris can
easily, and suddenly, cause serious injury.
Have a well-charged cell phone nearby, keeping network communications
as open as possible for emergencies.
Once conditions have improved, remain in shelter until the all-clear,
COR 4, is announced from government officials.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for the latest forecasts.
&amp;&amp;
.NEXT UPDATE...
The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather
Service in Tiyan around 3 AM...or sooner if conditions warrant.
...TYPHOON WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT...
...New Information...
Mawar`s southern eyewall is pivoting over Guam this evening. Typhoon
force winds and torrential rain persist. Considerable wind damage to
buildings of light material is occurring along with localized flash
flooding and the possibility of landslides. Significant coastal
erosion is likely, particularly along western shorelines.
...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Residents should remain in shelter within sturdy concrete homes with
concrete roofs, or wherever you are.
Again, once conditions have improved sometime on Thursday or Friday,
remain in shelter until the all-clear, Cor 4, is given by government
officials.
&amp;&amp;
...Winds...
Mawar`s intense southern eyewall winds have pivoted onshore. Sustained
winds of 140 mph, particularly along the southern eyewall, may
persist over Guam this evening and possibly through midnight. Winds
will ease early Thursday morning, with damaging tropical storm
conditions for much of the day on Thursday.
Exposed, higher terrain of the island is likely to experience higher
winds. The island can expect continued westerly typhoon force winds
shifting southwest to southerly midnight and early Thursday.
Considerable damage to buildings and homes of light material is
expected. Extensive damage to non-concrete roofs. Non-reinforced
concrete walls could be blown down. Severe damage to well-built
wooden and metal structures possible. Some reinforced hollow-spun
concrete power poles and many reinforced wooden power poles could be
downed. Large projectiles and debris are possible. Most small and
medium sized steel frame signs could be bent over or damaged. Cars
and high paneled vehicles could be overturned. Major damage to
shrubbery and trees is likely with snapped or uprooted trees and
blocked roads. Defoliation of vegetation is likely, perhaps 40-60%
defoliation. Trees may snap or become uprooted. Electricity and water
may be unavailable for days.
...Storm surge and storm tide...
West/North Coastal Areas:
Surge of 4 to 6 feet is possible. Debris is likely to be lofted onto
vulnerable coastal roads and shoreline properties. Apra Harbor may
see surge up to 4 feet. West and southern portions of Malesso may see
surge up of 2 to 4 feet. Mawar`s close passage to Ritidian Point
may lead to surge of 5 to 10 feet with considerable shoreline erosion
and reshaping of the shoreline. Ritidian Buoy pegged max wave
heights of over 40 feet.
Severe coastal erosion is likely. Large boats could be torn from
moorings. Extensive damage is possible.
Dangerous surf persists along many coastlines due to typhoon force
winds and victory at sea conditions. Storm surf of 8 to 15 feet
along north, west and southwest facing reefs will become hazardous as
longer period energy builds in Thursday night or Friday.
...Inland flooding...
A Flood Watch is in effect for Guam. Listen for possible flood
warnings, and be ready to act if flooding rains occur.
Additional rainfall of 10 to 15 inches of rain is possible the next
day or so with some areas potentially seeing up to 25 inches.
Landslides are a distinct possibility for central to southern
Guam tonight as the southern eyewall pivots overhead. Locations that
do not normally flood may see considerable flooding. Monitor
conditions for possible flood advisories or warnings.</description>
