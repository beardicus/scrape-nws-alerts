<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY FOR AN ICE JAM RELEASE AND SNOWMELT NOW IN EFFECT
UNTIL NOON AKDT SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam release and snowmelt
continues.
* WHERE...Yukon River from Galena to Kaltag
* WHEN...Until noon AKDT Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding is occurring along the Yukon River from
Galena to Kaltag. Water is overbank into low lying areas along
much of the Yukon River. Water may impact fish camps and other
remote cabins along the river. In Galena, several roads are
inundated with water cutting off parts of the community. Water is
surrounding some homes, and sheds and other structures along lakes
in the community are impacted by floodwaters.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 300 PM AKDT Wednesday, water from a very large ice jam
above Ruby that released on Sunday combined with snowmelt
continues to send a surge of water downriver. The large
volume of water that was backed up behind this ice jam will
take many days to drain so water levels on the Yukon will
remain high for a number of days.
Water levels continue to recede in Ruby and are cresting in
Galena. As the flood crest moves downriver water levels will
increase between Koyukuk and Kaltag through at least
Thursday, while remaining steady and then very slowly
decreasing at Galena.
- Flooding is not expected in Kaltag due to the higher
elevation above the river.
-
For Yukon River at Ruby:
At 2 pm Wednesday the stage was 32.9 feet.
Flood Stage is 40.0 feet.
For Yukon River at Galena:
At 7 am Wednesday the stage was 125.1 feet.
Flood Stage is 124.0 feet.

- If you live near or along the Yukon between Ruby and Kaltag
prepare for minor flooding. Move valuables such as vehicles and
boats out of low lying areas and store them on higher ground.</description>
