<description>...SUPER TYPHOON MAWAR CONTINUES A SLOW APPROACH TOWARDS GUAM...
.NEW INFORMATION...
None.
.AREAS AFFECTED...
This local statement provides important information and recommended
actions for people in Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan. Guam will
see the devastating impacts from Super Typhoon Mawar.
.Watches/Warnings...
A Typhoon Warning continues for the following locations, Guam and
Rota. Damaging winds of 39 mph are expected within the next few
hours. Typhoon force winds of 74 mph or greater are expected soon
after sunrise.
A Tropical Storm Warning and a Typhoon Watch continues for the
following locations, Tinian and Saipan.
A Flood Watch is in effect for all of Guam and the Northern
Marianas. Please listen closely for any Flood Warnings that might
be in effect for your area.
.STORM INFORMATION...
At 1 AM ChST...the center of Super Typhoon Mawar (02W) was
located near latitude 12.3N...longitude 145.9E. This was about
110 miles southeast of Guam. Storm Motion was west-northwest at 5
mph. Storm intensity is currently 155 mph.
.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
Super Typhoon Mawar continues its approach to Guam. Passage very
near or directly over Guam is imminent. The latest forecast from
the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) indicates this storm will
strengthen further to a category 5 typhoon with maximum sustained
winds of 160 mph, with gusts approaching 200 mph. This is
expected to occur over the next few hours, prior to making
landfall. The triple threats of Super Typhoon Mawar are,
torrential rains that may result in landslides and flash
flooding, catastrophic wind, and life-threatening storm surge.
This is expected for Guam, with potently catastrophic coastal flooding
for southeastern and southern portions of Guam. A mandatory
evacuation order was initiated by the governor of Guam yesterday.
Storm surge potential is extreme, please see the storm surge and
surf info below, as a large storm surge and coastal impacts are
expected, particularly for coastal areas just north of the eye of
Super Typhoon Mawar on the east to southeast sides of Guam. Gaum
and the CNMI are all in COR1 by their respective governors.
.PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
All preparations for the protection of life and property should now
be complete. You should be in a fully-reinforced concrete
structure, especially on Guam.
For interests at ports, docks and marinas, prescribed preparations
according to your emergency operations plan for tropical cyclones
should now be complete. If you live on a boat, if you haven`t already
done so, make final preparations for securing your craft before
leaving it.
During the storm...stay inside and away from windows. Do not venture
outside when high winds are occurring or during temporary lulls as
flying debris can easily, and suddenly, cause serious injury. If the
eye passes over you, extreme winds will suddenly cease. This is not
the end of the typhoon--REMAIN IN SHELTER as extreme winds will
rapidly resume.
Have a well-charged cell phone nearby, keeping network
communications as open as possible for emergencies.
Once conditions have improved, remain in shelter until the all-clear,
COR 4, is announced from government officials.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for the latest forecasts.
&amp;&amp;
.NEXT UPDATE...
The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather
Service in Tiyan around 5 AM...or sooner if conditions warrant.
...TYPHOON WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Stay calm and keep informed. IT`S TOO LATE to make any additional
final preparations.
Residents should remain in shelter within sturdy concrete homes with
concrete roofs, or wherever you currently are.
If staying in a home, turn the refrigerator to maximum cold and keep
it closed. Turn off propane tanks and unplug small appliances. Fill
the bathtub with water in case the tap water becomes unavailable
after the storm. This is for cleaning/flushing purposes. Do not
drink it.
During the storm, stay inside and away from windows in a building
with concrete walls and a concrete roof. Stay away from the ocean
due to high surf, strong rip currents and the possibility of storm
surge. Large ships should be secured as they will be torn from
moorings. Do not venture outside when high winds are occurring or
during temporary lulls as flying debris can easily, and
suddenly, cause serious injury.
&amp;&amp;
...Probability of tropical storm/typhoon conditions...
Tropical storm conditions are in the next few hours. Typhoon
conditions are a distinct possibility between noontime and 5 PM
today, if Super Typhoon Mawar remains a bit farther north than the
current forecast track.
...Winds...
Damaging winds (sustained winds of 39 mph or more) will arrive later
during the next few hours.
There is still a distinct possibility for typhoon force winds. The
most likely timeframe for typhoon force winds would be noontime to
5 PM today. Wind direction is still likely to be northeast,
shifting east to southeast.
Corrugated metal and plywood may be stripped from poorly constructed
buildings and become airborne. Wooden power poles which are rotten or
not reinforced could be tilted or even broken. Poorly constructed
signs could become damaged. Banana, papaya and other similar crops
could topple.
...Storm surge and storm tide...
Storm surge of 2 to 5 feet above the normal high tide is expected as
Mawar passes closer to Guam today. Higher surge values around 5
feet would be realized if Super Typhoon Mawar passes closer to
northern Guam. Large boats could be torn from moorings. Moderate
coastal erosion and reef damage is likely, particularly along
southeast to eastern reefs. Moderate damage is possible.
Surf continue to build through the night along south and east facing
reefs with dangerous surf of 15 to 25 feet. Hazardous surf is
likely to spread to west facing reefs Thursday as Super Typhoon Mawar
moves west into the Philippine Sea.
...Inland flooding...
A Flood Watch is in effect for the entire area. Listen for
possible flood warnings for your location, and be ready to act if
flooding rains occur.
Heavy rainfall is likely to develop this morning and continue
through Thursday. Torrential rain is quite possible as Mawar
passes to the south closer to Guam. Rainfall amounts of 4 to 8
inches are possible with locally higher amounts. A slowing of
forward speed and drift farther north could lead to higher
rainfall totals. Monitor conditions for possible flood advisories
or warnings.</description>
