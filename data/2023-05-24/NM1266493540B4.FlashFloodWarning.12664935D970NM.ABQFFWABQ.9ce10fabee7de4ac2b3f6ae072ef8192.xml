vulnerable drainages in and downstream of the northern Hermit`s Peak
Calf Canyon fire burn area.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Do not camp along streams and rivers. Remain alert when hiking in
steep, narrow canyons. Know where you are relative to low spots and
drainages.
This is a life threatening situation. Heavy rainfall will cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks, streams and ditches
in the Hermits Peak Calf Canyon Burn Scar. Severe debris flows can
also be anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may be washed
away in places. If you encounter flood waters, climb to safety.</instruction>
