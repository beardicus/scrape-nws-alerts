<description>...SUPER TYPHOON MAWAR CONTINUES A SLOW APPROACH TOWARDS GUAM...
.NEW INFORMATION...
None.
.AREAS AFFECTED...
This local statement provides important information and recommended
actions for people in Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan. Guam will
see the devastating impacts from Super Typhoon Mawar.
.Watches/Warnings...
A Typhoon Warning continues for the following locations, Guam and
Rota. Damaging winds of 39 mph are expected within the next few
hours. Typhoon force winds of 74 mph or greater are expected soon
after sunrise.
A Tropical Storm Warning and a Typhoon Watch continues for the
following locations, Tinian and Saipan.
A Flood Watch is in effect for all of Guam and the Northern
Marianas. Please listen closely for any Flood Warnings that might
be in effect for your area.
.STORM INFORMATION...
At 1 AM ChST...the center of Super Typhoon Mawar (02W) was
located near latitude 12.3N...longitude 145.9E. This was about
110 miles southeast of Guam. Storm Motion was west-northwest at 5
mph. Storm intensity is currently 155 mph.
.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
Super Typhoon Mawar continues its approach to Guam. Passage very
near or directly over Guam is imminent. The latest forecast from
the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) indicates this storm will
strengthen further to a category 5 typhoon with maximum sustained
winds of 160 mph, with gusts approaching 200 mph. This is
expected to occur over the next few hours, prior to making
landfall. The triple threats of Super Typhoon Mawar are,
torrential rains that may result in landslides and flash
flooding, catastrophic wind, and life-threatening storm surge.
This is expected for Guam, with potently catastrophic coastal flooding
for southeastern and southern portions of Guam. A mandatory
evacuation order was initiated by the governor of Guam yesterday.
Storm surge potential is extreme, please see the storm surge and
surf info below, as a large storm surge and coastal impacts are
expected, particularly for coastal areas just north of the eye of
Super Typhoon Mawar on the east to southeast sides of Guam. Gaum
and the CNMI are all in COR1 by their respective governors.
.PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
All preparations for the protection of life and property should now
be complete. You should be in a fully-reinforced concrete
structure, especially on Guam.
For interests at ports, docks and marinas, prescribed preparations
according to your emergency operations plan for tropical cyclones
should now be complete. If you live on a boat, if you haven`t already
done so, make final preparations for securing your craft before
leaving it.
During the storm...stay inside and away from windows. Do not venture
outside when high winds are occurring or during temporary lulls as
flying debris can easily, and suddenly, cause serious injury. If the
eye passes over you, extreme winds will suddenly cease. This is not
the end of the typhoon--REMAIN IN SHELTER as extreme winds will
rapidly resume.
Have a well-charged cell phone nearby, keeping network
communications as open as possible for emergencies.
Once conditions have improved, remain in shelter until the all-clear,
COR 4, is announced from government officials.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for the latest forecasts.
&amp;&amp;
.NEXT UPDATE...
The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather
Service in Tiyan around 5 AM...or sooner if conditions warrant.
...TROPICAL STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...TYPHOON WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IS NOW IN EFFECT...
...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
IT`S TOO LATE to make any further preparations. Comply with any
evacuation orders. Shelter in place until the local governments
gives the &quot;all clear&quot; and conditions are raised to TCOR 4.
&amp;&amp;
...Winds...
East to northeast winds will increase through the day, becoming
damaging around sunrise, with winds in the 30 to 40 mph range with
gusts to around 55 mph. Higher winds are likely for higher
terrain such as Capitol Hill. Winds are forecast to increase
through the day as they shift to an easterly then southeasterly
direction. Typhoon conditions are still possible, but this hinges
on a northward drift with Super Typhoon Mawar.
Power outages are possible. Corrugated metal and plywood could be
stripped from poorly constructed homes. Wooden power poles could
be tilted. Poorly constructed signs could be damaged. Banana,
papaya and fleshy crops could see damage.
...Storm surge and storm tide...
Storm surge of 1 to 3 ft above the normal high tide is expected along
south and eastern shores. Coastal erosion is possible but not
expected to be significant. There could be minor to moderate pier
damage for coastal areas exposed to the south and east. Large
boats could be torn from moorings. Moderate damage is possible.
Surf will build sharply today along south and east facing reefs with
dangerous surf of 8 to 15 feet building to 15 to to 20 feet.
Hazardous surf is likely to spread to west facing reefs Friday as
Mawar moves west into the Philippine Sea.
...Inland flooding...
A Flood Watch is in effect for Saipan and Tinian. Listen for possible
flood warnings...and be ready to act if flooding rains occur.
Heavy rainfall is possible through tonight with rainfall amounts
of 2 to 5 inches. If Super Typhoon Mawar shifts a bit farther
north, rainfall amounts could rise to between 5 and 8 inches.</description>
