<headline>Flood Watch issued May 24 at 1:04PM ChST until May 25 at 7:45AM ChST by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Guam. Rota, Saipan and Tinian.
* WHEN...Through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in considerable flooding of
rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone
locations. Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Extensive
street flooding and flooding of creeks and rivers are possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Typhoon Mawar continues to approach Guam and Rota. As
the storm gets closer, locally heavy showers are expected to
increase
significantly. Latest model guidance shows rainfall potential
in excess of 15 inches, with locally heavier amounts of 20+
inches
possible. This would result in extensive flooding across the
islands. Events of this size can cause flooding in areas that
normally do not flood.

should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.</instruction>
