* WHAT...Arroyo and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of east central New Mexico, including the
following counties, Curry and Quay.
* WHEN...Until 1045 PM MDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
Rises in small streams and normally dry arroyos. Overflowing poor
drainage areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 743 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to a
severe thunderstorm approaching Clovis from the north. This
will cause arroyo and small stream flooding, as well as urban
flooding in the Clovis area. Up to 1.5 inches of rain have
already fallen just north of Clovis. With a rain rate
potentially reaching 4 inches per hour, flash flooding is
highly likely in Clovis when the storm arrives between 8 to 9
PM MDT.
- Additional rainfall amounts up to 4 inches are expected over
the area. There is a high potential for flash flooding to
develop.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Clovis, Texico, Melrose, Ranchvale, Cannon Air Force Base,
Saint Vrain, Portair, Pleasant Hill and Forrest.
- This includes the following highways...
Highway 60 between Mile Markers 362 and 397.
