<description>...CATEGORY 4 TYPHOON MAWAR CONTINUES A SLOW APPROACH TOWARDS GUAM...
Corrected details in Guam inland flooding section
.NEW INFORMATION...
None.
.AREAS AFFECTED...
This local statement provides important information and recommended
actions for people in Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan. Guam will see
the devastating impacts from Mawar.
.Watches/Warnings...
A Typhoon Warning continues for the Guam and Rota. Damaging winds of
39 mph are occurring. Typhoon force winds of 74 mph or greater are
expected later this morning.
A Tropical Storm Warning and a Typhoon Watch continues for Tinian and
Saipan.
A Flood Watch is in effect for Guam and the Northern Marianas. Please
listen closely for any Flood Warnings that might be in effect for
your area.
.STORM INFORMATION...
At 8 AM ChST...the eye of Cat 4 Typhoon Mawar (02W) was located near
latitude 12.8N...longitude 145.7E based on a PGUA radar fix. This was
about 75 miles southeast of Guam. Storm motion was towards the north-
west at 6 mph. Storm intensity is currently 140 mph.
.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
Mawar continues its approach towards Guam. Passage very near or
directly over Guam is imminent. The latest forecast from the Joint
Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) indicates that Mawar may strengthen
slightly on approach to Guam with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph,
with gusts approaching 175 mph at landfall. This is expected to
occur over the next few hours, prior to making landfall.
The triple threats of Cat 4 Typhoon Mawar are, torrential rains that
may result in landslides and flash flooding, catastrophic wind, and
life-threatening storm surge. This is expected for Guam, with
potently catastrophic coastal flooding for southeastern and southern
portions of Guam if a southern Guam or Cocos passage is realized. A
mandatory evacuation order was initiated by the governor of Guam
yesterday. Storm surge potential is extreme, please see the storm
surge and surf info below, as a large storm surge and coastal impacts
are expected, particularly for coastal areas just north of the eye
of Typhoon Mawar on the east to southeast sides of Guam. Guam and the
CNMI are all in COR 1 by their respective governors.
.PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
All preparations for the protection of life and property should now
be complete. You should be in a fully-reinforced concrete structure,
especially on Guam.
During the storm...stay inside and away from windows. Do not venture
outside when high winds are occurring or during temporary lulls as
flying debris can easily, and suddenly, cause serious injury. If the
eye passes over you on Guam, extreme winds will suddenly cease. This
is not the end of the typhoon. REMAIN IN SHELTER as extreme winds
will rapidly resume.
Have a well-charged cell phone nearby, keeping network communications
as open as possible for emergencies.
Once conditions have improved, remain in shelter until the all-clear,
COR 4, is announced from government officials.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for the latest forecasts.
&amp;&amp;
.NEXT UPDATE...
The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather
Service in Tiyan around 3 PM...or sooner if conditions warrant.
...TYPHOON WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
It is too late to make any further attempts to secure your shutters
or other preparatory concerns. Residents should remain in shelter
within sturdy concrete homes with concrete roofs, or wherever you are.
If the eye passes overhead, DO NOT GO OUTSIDE! Extreme winds will
rapidly return. DO NOT VENTURE OUTSIDE until the government of Guam
gives the &quot;all clear&quot;.
Again, once conditions have improved sometime late Thursday or
Friday, remain in shelter until the all-clear, Cor 4, is given by
government officials.
&amp;&amp;
...Probability of tropical storm/typhoon conditions...
Typhoon conditions are most likely to begin later this morning and
continue through the afternoon. Intense eyewall winds are expected
between noontime and evening hours today.
&amp;&amp;
...Winds...
The latest forecast is for typhoon force winds (winds 74 mph or
greater) developing later this morning, increasing noontime and
peaking noontime to afternoon. Maximum sustained winds of 145 mph,
with gusts between 175 mph are likely within the eyewall.
Exposed, higher terrain of the island is likely to experience higher
winds. Wind direction at any point on Guam is highly dependent on the
exact track of the eye. A direct passage over the island would lead to
major typhoon force winds from a mix of directions. A passage just
south of Guam would favor major typhoon force north to northeast winds
shifting east and then southeast to south. A passage just north of
Guam would favor major typhoon force winds from the northwest to
west, then southwest. Typhoon force winds will extend outward from
the center roughly 40 miles.
Mawar is likely to bring considerable damage to buildings and homes
of light material. Extensive damage to non- concrete roofs. Non-
reinforced concrete walls could be blown down. Severe damage to well-
built wooden and metal structures possible. Some reinforced hollow-
spun concrete power poles and many reinforced wooden power poles
could be downed. Large projectiles and debris are possible. Most
small and medium sized steel frame signs could be bent over or
damaged. Some fuel storage tanks could rupture. Cars and high paneled
vehicles could be overturned. Major damage to shrubbery and trees is
likely with snapped or uprooted trees and blocked roads. Defoliation
of vegetation is likely, perhaps 50-70% defoliation.
Electricity and water may be unavailable for days and perhaps weeks
after the storm passes. Many trees will be snapped or uprooted.
Fallen trees may cut off residential areas for days to weeks.
...Storm surge and storm tide...
Surge heights along any given coastal location on Guam will be highly
dependent on the exact track of Mawar.
Southeastern Guam:
The greatest concern would be if Mawar passes over southern Guam or
just south of Guam. This would bring large storm surge into
vulnerable coastal areas of Malesso, Inalahan, Ipan and Pago Bay.
Storm surge of 6 to 10 feet above the normal high tide is likely.
Surge could possibly reach to between 20 and 25 feet above normal
high tide if the worst scenario of a southern Guam or just south of
Guam eye passage occurs. Considerable coastal impacts are likely with
impassable roads due to debris and boulders.
West/North Coastal Areas:
Surge of 4 to 6 feet is possible, especially if Mawar`s center
passes over or just north of Guam. Debris is likely to be lofted onto
vulnerable coastal roads and shoreline properties. Apra Harbor may
see surge up to 4 feet. Coastal roads may see debris lofted up on the
road.
Severe coastal erosion is likely. Large boats could be torn from
moorings. Extensive damage is possible.
Surf continues to build along the south and east facing reefs,
with dangerous surf of 20 to 30 feet possible late tonight into
Wednesday. Rough surf may develop along west facing reefs as early
as Thursday, with hazardous surf possible Thursday night or Friday.
...Inland flooding...
A Flood Watch is in effect for the entire area. Listen for
possible flood warnings, and be ready to act if flooding rains
occur.
Heavy rainfall is likely to develop late this morning and after noon.
Torrential rain is likely as Mawar passes near or overhead. Hourly
rainfall rates could reach 7&quot;/hr in the eyewall. The slower forward
motion may lead to rainfall of 15 to 20 inches with locally higher
amounts. Landslides are a distinct possibility for central to southern
Guam along with overflowing streams and rivers. Locations that do not
normally flood may see considerable flooding. Monitor conditions
for possible flood advisories or warnings.</description>
