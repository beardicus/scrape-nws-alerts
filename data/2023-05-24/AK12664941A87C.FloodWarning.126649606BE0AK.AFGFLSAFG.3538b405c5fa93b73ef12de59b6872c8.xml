<description>...FLOOD WARNING FOR SNOWMELT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON AKDT
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by snowmelt continues.
* WHERE...The Yukon and Porcupine River at Fort Yukon
* WHEN...Until Noon AKDT Friday.
* IMPACTS...The runway remains cutoff from the terminal due to water
over the ramp and planes are unable to taxi to the terminal. High
water is impacting the road by the Voc-Ed building and flooding
portions of 4th, 6th, and 7th Ave. Several residences in low-lying
areas have flooded. There is also water around the north end of
the runway. The road east of the Tribal Hall has been breached to
reduce water levels and allow water to flow back towards the Yukon
River.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 430 PM AKDT Wednesday, a large volume of water from
snowmelt continues to move down the Yukon River. Water levels
are falling on the Porcupine River but are steady or slowly
rising on the Yukon River. Water levels on the Yukon River at
Dawson City and Eagle continue to slowly rise, so the Yukon
River at Fort Yukon will remain high into next week.
Satellite imagery and local reports indicate water is
lowering in portions of Fort Yukon, but water and flooding of
low lying parts of the community will persist for the next
several days.

- If you live near or along the Yukon or Porcupine River at Fort
Yukon stay alert and be prepared to take action.</description>
