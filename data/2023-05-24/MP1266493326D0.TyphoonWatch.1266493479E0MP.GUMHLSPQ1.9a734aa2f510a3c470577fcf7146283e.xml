<headline>Typhoon Watch issued May 24 at 3:32PM ChST until further notice by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...CATEGORY 4 TYPHOON MAWAR JUST EAST OF GUAM...
.NEW INFORMATION...
None.
.AREAS AFFECTED...
This local statement provides important information and recommended
actions for people in Guam and the Northern Marianas.
.Watches/Warnings...
A Typhoon Warning continues for Guam and Rota. Typhoon force
winds of 74 mph or greater are occurring over Guam and could spread
to Rota later this afternoon with a slight northward shift of Mawar.
A Tropical Storm Warning and a Typhoon Watch continue for Saipan and
Tinian.
A Flood Watch is in effect for Guam and the Northern Marianas. Please
listen closely for any Flood Warnings that might be in effect for
your area.
.STORM INFORMATION...
At 2 PM ChST...the center of Cat 4 Typhoon Mawar was located near
latitude 13.3N...longitude 145.4E based on a 1:29 PM PGUA radar fix.
This was about 40 miles east-southeast of Guam. Storm motion was
towards the northwest at 3 mph. Storm intensity is currently 140 mph
sustained.
.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
Mawar continues its approach towards Guam. Although its approach has
been excruciatingly slow, passage near or directly over Guam is still
favored and imminent early this evening. Its slow motion will prolong
high-impact conditions over Guam. The latest forecast from the Joint
Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) moves Mawar over Guam with sustained
winds of 140 mph around 5 to 7 pm.
The triple threats of Cat 4 Typhoon Mawar are, torrential rains that
may result in landslides and flash flooding, catastrophic wind, and
life-threatening storm surge. This is expected for Guam, and to a
lesser extent Rota.
.PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
You should be in a fully-reinforced concrete structure,
especially on Guam.
Stay inside and away from windows. Do not venture outside when high
winds are occurring or during temporary lulls as flying debris can
easily, and suddenly, cause serious injury. If the eye passes over you
on Guam, extreme winds will suddenly cease. This is not the end of
the typhoon. REMAIN IN SHELTER as extreme winds will rapidly resume.
Have a well-charged cell phone nearby, keeping network communications
as open as possible for emergencies.
Once conditions have improved, remain in shelter until the all-clear,
COR 4, is announced from government officials.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for the latest forecasts.
&amp;&amp;
.NEXT UPDATE...
The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather
Service in Tiyan around 9 PM...or sooner if conditions warrant.
...TROPICAL STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...TYPHOON WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IS NOW IN EFFECT...
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT...
...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Shelter in place until the local governments gives the &quot;all clear&quot;
and conditions are raised to TCOR 4.
&amp;&amp;
...Winds...
East to northeast winds of 40 to 55 mph are expected this evening and
overnight. Higher winds are likely for elevated terrain such as
Capitol Hill. Typhoon conditions are looking less likely.
Power outages are possible. Corrugated metal and plywood could be
stripped from poorly constructed homes. Wooden power poles could
be tilted. Poorly constructed signs could be damaged. Banana,
papaya and fleshy crops could see damage.
...Storm surge and storm tide...
Storm surge up to 3 ft above the normal high tide is expected along
south and eastern shores. Coastal erosion is possible but not
expected to be significant. There could be minor to moderate pier
damage for coastal areas exposed to the south and east. Large boats
could still be torn from moorings. Moderate damage is possible.
Surf will build sharply along south and east facing reefs with
dangerous surf of 8 to 15 feet building to 10 to to 20 feet. Hazardous
surf is likely to spread to west facing reefs Friday as Mawar moves
west into the Philippine Sea.
...Inland flooding...
A Flood Watch is in effect for Saipan and Tinian. Listen for possible
flood warnings...and be ready to act if flooding rains occur.
Heavy rainfall is possible through Thursday with rainfall amounts
of 2 to 4 inches. This is most likely if Mawar`s outer rainbands
train overhead tonight.</description>
