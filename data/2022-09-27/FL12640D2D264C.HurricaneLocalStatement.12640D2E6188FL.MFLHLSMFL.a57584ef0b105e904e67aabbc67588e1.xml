SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Ian made landfall over western Cuba as a major hurricane
earlier this morning, and is forecast to maintain strength as it
enters the Gulf of Mexico waters later today. While a direct landfall
to South Florida remains unlikely at this time, hazardous conditions
will extend well away from the center of the system. The following
hazardous conditions can be expected for South Florida:
* Multiple rounds of heavy rainfall associated with rainbands may lead
to flooding across all of South Florida. Rainfall totals may range
4 to 8 inches through Thursday with locally higher totals possible.
Flash flooding will be possible in this environment.
* Peak storm surge values of 3 to 5 feet are possible ranging from the
Southwest Florida coast down towards the coast of Flamingo and far
southern peninsula. The primary threat window is between Tuesday night
and Wednesday night. This could lead to significant and
life-threatening storm surge flooding.
* Tornadoes embedded in showers and thunderstorms within the outer
rainbands associated with the system were observed overnight, and will
continue to be possible through this evening.
* Hazardous marine and beach conditions are expected, as a high risk
for rip currents is in effect across all South Florida beaches.
Dangerous surf conditions are expected along the Gulf coast.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Protect against dangerous wind having possible significant impacts
primarily across portions of Southwest Florida from Mainland Monroe county
to Glades county, but also may be possible over inland portions of Palm
Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade counties. Potential impacts in this area
include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
Also, protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts
across the rest of South Florida.
* SURGE:
Prepare for life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across the Southwest Florida coast. Potential impacts in this
area include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
Also, prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across the coast of Florida Bay. Minor tidal flooding is also
possible in vulnerable locations along the southeastern coast of
South Florida.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across South Florida. Potential impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.
- Ditches and canals may rapidly overflow their banks in multiple
places. Flood control systems and barriers may become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.
Streets, parking lots and underpasses become submerged. Driving
conditions become dangerous. Many road and bridge closures with
some weakened or washed out.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
South Florida. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, mobile
homes pushed off foundations or overturned, large tree tops and
branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving
vehicles blown off roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
Storm surge is the leading killer associated with tropical storms and
hurricanes! Make sure you are in a safe area away from the surge
zone. Even if you are not in a surge-prone area, you could find
yourself cutoff by flood waters during and after the storm. Heed
evacuation orders issued by the local authorities.
