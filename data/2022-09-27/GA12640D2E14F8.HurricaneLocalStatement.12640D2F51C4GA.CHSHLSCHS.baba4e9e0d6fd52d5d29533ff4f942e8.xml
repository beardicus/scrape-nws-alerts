SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Ian will slowly track northward across the eastern Gulf of
Mexico and then across Florida through Friday. Although the storm will
continue to weaken as it moves farther north into Georgia and South
Carolina late week significant impacts from coastal flooding, heavy rain
and tropical storm force winds are likely across southeast South Carolina
and southeast Georgia. A few tornadoes will also be possible. The worst
conditions overall should generally occur closer to the coast. In
addition, beach erosion and dangerous marine and surf conditions are expected.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Prepare for life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across tidal portions of southern South Carolina and northern Georgia.
Potential impacts in this area include:
- Areas of inundation of saltwater along immediate shorelines and
in low-lying spots farther inland near rivers and creeks, with
storm surge flooding accentuated by waves. Damage to several
buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in normally vulnerable low
spots.
- Moderate to major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching
dunes. Strong and numerous rip currents.
- Minor to moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and
piers. Several small craft broken away from moorings,
especially in unprotected anchorages. Some navigation aids
possibly displaced well off station, creating difficult
navigation near inlets and waterways.
Elsewhere across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia,
little to no impact is anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant
impacts across mainly coastal portions of southeast South Carolina
and southeast Georgia. Potential impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with
swifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,
especially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks,
canals, and ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places could experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
Prepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across inland portions of southeast South Carolina
and southeast Georgia.
* WIND:
Prepare for dangerous wind having possible significant impacts across
mainly northern portions of the Georgia coast. Potential impacts in this
area include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges and access routes
impassable.
- Travel by vehicle or on foot increasingly difficult. Danger of
death or injury from falling objects such as trees or electric
wires outside.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines, which could persist for hours
or days.
- Some poorly secured small craft could break loose from their
moorings.
Also, prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts
across much of southeast South Carolina and inland portions of southeast
Georgia.
* OTHER COASTAL HAZARDS:
Life-threatening surf conditions, including dangerous rip currents, high waves,
and beach erosion are likely across coastal portions of southeast South
Carolina and southeast Georgia.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across mainly coastal
areas of southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia. Potential impacts include:
- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency plans.
- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along with
power and communications disruptions.
- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees, vehicles,
boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and other poorly
constructed structures.
Elsewhere across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia,
little to no impact is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so immediately.
For those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,
falling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move,
relocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help keep
roadways open for those under evacuation orders.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies
kit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your
home or business.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
If in a place that is vulnerable to high wind, such as near large
trees, a manufactured home, upper floors of a high-rise building, or
on a boat, plan to move to safe shelter.
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
near the ocean or a large inland lake, in a low-lying or poor
drainage area, in a valley, or near an already swollen river, plan to
move to safe shelter on higher ground.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes
to the forecast.
