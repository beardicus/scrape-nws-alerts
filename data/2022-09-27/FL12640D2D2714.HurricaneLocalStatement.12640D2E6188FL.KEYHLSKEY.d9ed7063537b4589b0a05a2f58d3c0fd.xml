SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
At 500 AM EDT, the center of Hurricane Ian was located about 5 miles
south of Pinar del Rio, Cuba or about 200 miles southwest of Key West.
Ian is moving towards the north, and this motion is expected to
continue today. A turn toward the north-northeast with a reduction in
forward speed is forecast tonight and Wednesday. On the forecast track,
the center of Ian is expected to move over western Cuba during the
next few hours. Ian will then emerge over the southeastern Gulf of
Mexico later this morning, pass west of the Florida Keys later today,
and approach the west coast of Florida on Wednesday and Wednesday
night.
Ian will pass west of the Florida Keys this afternoon and tonight as a
major hurricane with a large wind field extending well to the east of
the center of circulation. Threats will include damaging wind gusts
from fast moving, severe squalls, storm surge flooding 1 to 3 feet
above normal high tides, 4 to 6 inches of flooding rainfall with
localized totals up to 8 inches, and isolated tornadoes.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for dangerous winds having possible significant impacts
across the Florida Keys. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with minor
damage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few
buildings may experience window, door, and garage door
failures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.
Unsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Isolated power and communications outages possible.
* SURGE:
Protect against hazardous storm surge having possible significant
impacts across the Florida Keys. Potential impacts in this area
include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves.
- Sections of secondary roads become weakened or washed out,
especially in usually vulnerable low spots.
- Minor beach erosion.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across the Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rainfall
flooding at low-lying spots, and poor drainage areas. Some
streets and parking lots take on moving water as storm drains
and retention ponds overflow. Some secondary road closures due
to freshwater flooding.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
the Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, mobile
homes damaged, large tree tops and branches snapped off,
shallow rooted trees knocked over, and small boats pulled from
moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Residents and visitors in campgrounds, recreational vehicles, travel
trailers, liveaboard vessels, and mobile homes should prepare to seek
shelter with friends or family in a safe structure throughout the
storm.
