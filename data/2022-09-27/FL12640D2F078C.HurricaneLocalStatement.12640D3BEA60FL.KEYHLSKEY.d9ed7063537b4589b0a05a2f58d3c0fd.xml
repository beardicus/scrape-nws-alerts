SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
At 500 PM EDT, the center of Hurricane Ian was located about 45 miles
south-southwest of the Dry Tortugas. Ian is moving toward the north
near 10 mph. A turn toward the north-northeast with a reduction in
forward speed is forecast tonight and Wednesday. On the forecast track,
the center of Ian is expected to move over the southeastern Gulf of
Mexico tonight, pass west of the Florida Keys later tonight, and
approach the west coast of Florida Wednesday and Wednesday night.
Maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph, and re-strengthening is
expected tonight through Wednesday. Ian is forecast to approach the
west coast of Florida as an extremely dangerous major hurricane.
The threats and impacts to the Florida Keys have not changed with this
cycle. These threats will include damaging wind gusts from fast
moving, severe squalls, storm surge flooding 1 to 3 feet above normal
high tides, and an additional 4 to 6 inches of flooding rainfall, and
isolated tornadoes.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for dangerous winds having possible significant impacts
across the Florida Keys. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with minor
damage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few
buildings may experience window, door, and garage door
failures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.
Unsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Isolated power and communications outages possible.
* SURGE:
Protect against hazardous storm surge having possible significant
impacts across the Florida Keys. Potential impacts in this area
include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves.
- Sections of secondary roads become weakened or washed out,
especially in usually vulnerable low spots.
- Minor beach erosion.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across the Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rainfall
flooding at low-lying spots, and poor drainage areas. Some
streets and parking lots take on moving water as storm drains
and retention ponds overflow. Some secondary road closures due
to freshwater flooding.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
the Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, mobile homes
damaged, large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow rooted
trees knocked over, and small boats pulled from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Residents and visitors in campgrounds, recreational vehicles, travel
trailers, liveaboard vessels, and mobile homes should prepare to seek
shelter with friends or family in a safe structure throughout the
storm.
The Key West International Airport is closed to commercial airlines.
