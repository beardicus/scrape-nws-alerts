<headline>Flood Warning issued March 23 at 11:17PM EDT until March 24 at 2:00AM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 245 AM EDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...Central and eastern Henderson County, North Carolina.
* WHEN...Until 245 AM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor Flooding along Mud Creek and high flows along the
Green River are expected. Nuisance to Minor flooding along the
Green River is possible.
* At 10.0 feet, Mud Creek may be overtopping the S. Grove St bridge
deck and inundating S. Grove St adjacent to the bridge.  The
railroad tracks adjacent to S. Grove St are likely overtopped by
floodwaters spilling onto E. Caswell St. Mud Creek is approaching
the underside of the bridge deck at Erkwood Dr with flooding along
Erkwood Dr likely.  Significant farmland flooding is ongoing
within a 5-mile reach up and downstream from the Erkwood Dr. gauge
site, and may be impacting several outbuildings and farm
structures.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1058 PM EDT, Periods of moderate to heavy rain over the
past 24 hours has resulted in 2-4 inches of storm-total
rainfall across Henderson County, with localized totals
exceeding 5 inches within the headwaters of Mud Creek and the
Green River. This has caused excessive runoff and significant
stream rises across much of Henderson County, but especially
within the Mud Creek and Green River watersheds.  Minor
flooding is ongoing and additional Minor flooding is likely
to develop over the next 1-3 hours before area streams crest
and begin to recede later overnight.
Minor flooding is defined as flooding of parks, greenways,
farmland, nurseries, woodlands, and low-water crossings up to
2-4 feet deep as well as inundation of secondary roads and
campgrounds up to 1-2 feet deep.
Mud Creek is above the Minor Flood Stage of 8.5 feet at 9.2
feet.  Moderate Flood Stage is 10.0 feet.  Mud Creek`s rate
of rise is slowing and a crest may be imminent; however, it
is likely Mud Creek will approach 9.8-10.0 feet before
cresting over the next 2-4 hours.  A reasonable worst-case
crest of 10.5 feet is possible.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Hendersonville, Flat Rock, Mountain Home, Laurel Park, Dupont
State Forest, Jones Gap State Park, Chimney Rock State Park,
Valley Hill, East Flat Rock, Dana, Tuxedo, Crab Creek and
Edneyville.
