<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued March 23 at 10:53PM EDT until March 24 at 2:00AM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has extended
the
* Flash Flood Warning for...
Northwestern Burke County in western North Carolina...
Northwestern Caldwell County in western North Carolina...
* Until 200 AM EDT.
* At 1053 PM EDT, Heavy rainfall has ended across northwest Caldwell
and northwest Burke counties.  However, excessive runoff continues
over the warned area following storm-total rainfall of 2-4 inches,
with 1-1.5 inches falling between 7pm and 830pm on top of
saturated soils.  As a result, larger streams including Wilson
Creek, Warrior Fork, Roses Creek, Linville River, and Johns River
are still rising rapidly.  Expect these streams to continue to
rise sharply for at least the next 1-3 hours, with rises
continuing on Johns River, downstream of Collettsville, into the
overnight hours.  Therefore, because streams are continuing to
rise rapidly, and out-of-bank conditions are likely to continue
and/or develop over the next few hours, the Flash Flood Warning
will be extended until 2am to allow excessive runoff to abate and
the rate of rise on area streams to decelerate.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar and automated gauges.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, low-water
crossings, campgrounds, secondary roads adjacent to
streams as well as other poor drainage and low-lying
areas.  Expect nuisance to Minor flooding to develop
in common, flood-prone areas adjacent to the Johns
River near Collettsville, as well as campgrounds and
other low-lying areas near Nebo, Table Rock, and along
Wilson Creek near Edgemont.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Table Rock, Lake James, Edgemont, Collettsville, Globe and Upton.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR AND GAUGE INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
