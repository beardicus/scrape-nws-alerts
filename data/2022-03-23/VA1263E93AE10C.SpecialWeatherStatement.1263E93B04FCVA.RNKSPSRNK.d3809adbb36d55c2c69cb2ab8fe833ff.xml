<instruction>If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.
Locally heavy rain, with rates of two to four inches per hour in
some locations, will quickly reduce visibility and result in ponding
of water on roadways, standing water in low lying areas, and minor
flooding of creeks, streams, and areas of poor drainage.
Drivers are urged to slow down and use extra caution to avoid
hydroplaning.
Frequent cloud to ground lightning is occurring with these storms.
Lightning can strike 10 miles away from a thunderstorm. Seek a safe
shelter inside a building or vehicle.
A Tornado Watch remains in effect until midnight EDT for north
central North Carolina...and south central, southwestern and west
