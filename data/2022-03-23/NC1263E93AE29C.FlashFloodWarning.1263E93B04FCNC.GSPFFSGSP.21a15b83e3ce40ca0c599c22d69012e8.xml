levels. Flooding of low-lying areas is likely to remain as well.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar and automated gauges.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,
highways, streets and underpasses as well as other poor
drainage and low-lying areas.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Brevard, Rosman, Looking Glass, Lake Toxaway, Gorges State Park,
Dupont State Forest, Connestee, Balsam Grove, Penrose, Cedar
Mountain,  and Sapphire.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR AND GAUGE INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Heavy rain is increasing the risk of landslides, especially in areas
where slides have occurred in the past. Be especially alert if you
are near a stream, especially at the base of a mountain or in a
cove. Watch for loose-moving soil and rocks or a sudden increase in
streamflow. Leave the area quickly if this is observed. When driving
along roads where the terrain is steep or rocky, watch and listen
for falling rocks, mud, trees and other debris.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.</instruction>
