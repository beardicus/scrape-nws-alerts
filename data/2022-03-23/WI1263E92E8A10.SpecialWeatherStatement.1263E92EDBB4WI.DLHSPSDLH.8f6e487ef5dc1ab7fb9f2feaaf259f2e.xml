<headline>Special Weather Statement issued March 23 at 3:36PM CDT  by NWS Duluth</headline>
<description>...HEAVY SNOW THIS AFTERNOON OVER PORTIONS OF THE ARROWHEAD TO THE
I-35 Corridor...
Band of heavy snow from southern Lake County southwest to
southern St. Louis County southward along the I-35 corridor moving
southwest at 20 mph. Cities that will be affected by this band
include Two Harbors, Duluth, and Hinckley. Affected locations will
see rapidly changing weather and road conditions...with brief
heavy snow and gusty winds. Visibilities could drop to as low as a
half of a mile with a quick snow accumulation of one or two
inches.
This could lead to temporary whiteout conditions and the
potential for dangerous driving conditions. If you are traveling
and encounter adverse winter driving conditions...reduce speed and
make sure headlights are on.</description>
