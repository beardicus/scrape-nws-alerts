<headline>Special Weather Statement issued January 09 at 1:46AM EST  by NWS Paducah</headline>
<description>...Local wind gusts of 35 to 45 mph expected with bands of showers
and isolated thunderstorms through 6 am CST...
Bands of moderate to heavy rain showers, as well as a few
thunderstorms, will continue to work across the area overnight.
Gusty winds, occasionally gusting between 35 and 45 mph, may be
associated with some of the downpours of rain.
For travelers, the combination of rain and wind may reduce
visibility on the road ahead, as well as buffet the vehicle you
are driving. This may be problematic for those drivers of high
profile vehicles, such as tractor trailers.
The gusty winds will also toss around unsecured objects left
outdoors.
With the moist ground, the gusty winds and rain may also topple
weak or diseased trees or break off small branches. Should any of
these branches hit power lines, a brief power outage may result.
The majority of the wind gusts are expected to occur across west
Kentucky and parts of southwest Indiana, along and south of a
Paducah Kentucky to Rockport Indiana line.
These gusty winds should gradually subside across this area before
6 am CST Sunday.</description>
