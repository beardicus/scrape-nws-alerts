<description>...WARMING TEMPERATURES WILL RESULT IN INCREASED SNOW MELT AND
POTENTIAL FLOODING...
Temperatures will increase through the weekend, resulting in
increased snow melt in lower elevations. High temperatures for lower
elevations are expected to be in the middle to upper 50s to near 60
this weekend with low temperatures only dropping to near freezing.
These warm temperatures could result in significant low land snow
melt. Temperatures remaining near or even above freezing overnight
will further exasperate snow melt rates. Melted snow will likely run
off into local streams and rivers, and could cause some minor river
flooding along parts of the Bear River and its tributaries.
While most of the flooding potential will be as a result of runoff
in low elevations, snowmelt in the foothills will also increase flow
on small creeks and streams. Ice jam flooding is also possible on
streams and rivers that are still ice covered.
Now would be the time to clear snow, ice, and debris from culverts
and other flow paths to allow runoff to flow away from buildings and
other vulnerable infrastructure. This could include moving deep snow
away from the foundations of buildings, moving equipment, and moving
livestock out of poorly drained or low lying areas.
Stay tuned for the latest river forecasts and remember, if you
encounter a flooded roadway, turn around don`t drown, you never
know what road conditions are hidden under the water.</description>
