<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued April 26 at 3:15AM CDT until April 26 at 5:00PM CDT by NWS Corpus Christi</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 AM CDT THIS
MORNING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM THIS MORNING TO
5 PM CDT THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding
expected. For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip
currents.
* WHERE...Kleberg Islands and Nueces Islands Counties.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 8 AM this morning
to 5 PM CDT this afternoon. For the High Rip Current Risk,
until 7 AM CDT this morning.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Rip currents can sweep even
the most experienced swimmers away from shore into deeper
water. These rip currents can become life-threatening to
anyone entering the surf.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
