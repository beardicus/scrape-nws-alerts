...A RED FLAG WARNING IS IN EFFECT FROM MORNING THROUGH LATE
TUESDAY EVENING FOR RELATIVE HUMIDITY OF 6% OR LESS, 20FT WINDS OF
30 MPH OR MORE, VERY POOR OVERNIGHT RECOVERY, AND HIGH TO EXTREME
FIRE DANGER FOR SOUTHEAST NEW MEXICO AND MOST OF WEST TEXAS...
* AFFECTED AREA...Reeves County Plains.
* TIMING...Monday morning through late Tuesday evening.
* WINDS...Southwest 40 to 50 mph with gusts up to 65 mph.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...As low as 3 percent.
* RFTI...8 to 9 or extreme.
* IMPACTS...This is a particularly dangerous fire weather
pattern. Extremely critical fire weather conditions are expected
to persist for an extended period with little to no improvement
overnight. Avoid the use of open flames or any activities that
may generate sparks. Accidental ignitions will have the
potential to grow quickly into dangerous wind-driven wildfires.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now or will shortly. A combination of strong
winds, low relative humidity and warm temperatures will increase
potential for fire growth.</instruction>
