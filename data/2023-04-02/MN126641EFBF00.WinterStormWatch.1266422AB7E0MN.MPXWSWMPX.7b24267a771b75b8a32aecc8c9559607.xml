<description>...COMPLEX PROLONGED WINTER STORM TO BRING MULTIPLE PRECIPITATION
TYPES AND POSSIBLE BLIZZARD CONDITIONS ACROSS PORTIONS OF WESTERN
AND CENTRAL MINNESOTA TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...
.A complex storm system developing over the Rockies will shift
east into the Central Plains Tuesday, then quickly move northeast
into Minnesota Tuesday night and into Canada by Wednesday
afternoon. Precipitation will start as snow for much of the area
Tuesday morning, transitioning to a wintry mix of freezing rain,
sleet, and snow Tuesday afternoon and Tuesday night. A transition
back to snow showers will occur Wednesday. Total snow
accumulations of 3 to 7 inches are anticipated, with the highest
amounts over far western Minnesota. In addition, strong winds will
develop Tuesday and persist through Wednesday, potentially
resulting in blizzard conditions.
A Winter Storm Watch remains in effect for portions of western
and central Minnesota west of a line from Granite Falls to
Willmar, St. Cloud, and Lake Mille Lacs. Although predicted snow
totals have decreased, a small shift in the track back to the east
could result in more substantial accumulation.
...WINTER STORM WATCH NOW IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH
LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions possible. Total snow accumulations of
4 to 8 inches and ice accumulations of a light glaze possible.
Winds could gust as high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...Douglas and Stevens Counties.
* WHEN...From Tuesday morning through late Wednesday night.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute. Gusty
winds could bring down tree branches.</description>
