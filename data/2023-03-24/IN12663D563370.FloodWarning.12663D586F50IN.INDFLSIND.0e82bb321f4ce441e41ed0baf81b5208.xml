.Excessive rainfall continues to drive area waterways higher, and
this is pushing Sugar Creek at Edinburgh into flood.  The water
level is expected to continue rising overnight.  At present it is
forecast to crest slightly over 1 foot above flood stage, but later
forecasts likely will differ from this initial prediction.  Please
stay abreast of the latest conditions by monitoring further
information from the National Weather Service and local media.

NOTICE...

remember such a high stage for Petersburg and SR 257 remaining
