<headline>Flood Warning issued March 24 at 10:22PM EDT until April 04 at 5:00AM EDT by NWS Indianapolis</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following river and locations
in Indiana...Illinois...
Wabash River, from Lafayette down to Vincennes.
...The Flood Warning is extended for the following river and
location in Indiana...Illinois...
Wabash River at Mount Carmel.
.Rainfall totals of an inch to an inch and a half north of I-70 and
two to three inches along and south of there over the past two days
will combine with additional rainfall tonight to produce moderate
river flooding along the lower White River and nearby tributaries.
Widespread minor river flooding is expected along the Wabash and
East Fork White, with potential for moderate flooding at Seymour on
the East Fork White. Until the heavy rainfall exits the area late
tonight there remains potential for locally heavy rain to make the
flooding worse over southern parts of central Indiana.
The crests on the Wabash, White, and East Fork White are expected to
arrive on upper portions of the rivers early to late in the weekend
and start working their way downriver. Minor flooding is expected to
last on main stem rivers well into next week.
