<headline>Flood Warning issued March 24 at 10:30PM EDT until March 25 at 10:24PM EDT by NWS Indianapolis</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers and
locations in Indiana...
East Fork White River at multiple locations.
Driftwood River near Edinburgh.
Big Blue River at Shelbyville.
...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in
Indiana...
Flatrock River near Columbus.
East Fork White River near Rivervale.
Muscatatuck River at Vernon.
.Rainfall totals of an inch to an inch and a half north of I-70 and
two to three inches along and south of there over the past two days
will combine with additional rainfall tonight to produce moderate
river flooding along the lower White River and nearby tributaries.
Widespread minor river flooding is expected along the Wabash and
East Fork White, with potential for moderate flooding at Seymour on
the East Fork White. Until the heavy rainfall exits the area late
tonight there remains potential for locally heavy rain to make the
flooding worse over southern parts of central Indiana.
The crests on the Wabash, White, and East Fork White are expected to
arrive on upper portions of the rivers early to late in the weekend
and start working their way downriver. Minor flooding is expected to
last on main stem rivers well into next week.
