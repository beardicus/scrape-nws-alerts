<description>...STRONG FRONT TO BRING GUSTY WINDS, WARM TEMPERATURES, AND RAIN
TO THE KUSKOKWIM DELTA THIS WEEKEND...
A strong front will reach the Kuskokwim Delta Saturday afternoon
and remain nearly stationary over the region through early Monday
morning. Strong winds will arrive first early Saturday afternoon
with gusts up to 50 mph possible along the coast and near 40 mph
farther inland. The strong southerlies will quickly increase
temperatures into the mid-to-upper 30s, where they will remain
through Monday morning before colder air can move back in from the
west. Precipitation, mostly in the form of rain, will reach the
coast Saturday afternoon and spread inland overnight. The core of
the precipitation will remain stationary over the Delta through
late Sunday night with up to an inch of liquid precipitation
(rain) possible. There is some uncertainty in the precipitation
type forecast, but strong southerlies and temperatures in the mid-
to-upper 30s supports mostly rain for this event, though there
may be a transition back to snow towards Sunday night as cold air
moves in from the west. Stay tuned to the forecast for additional
updates.</description>
