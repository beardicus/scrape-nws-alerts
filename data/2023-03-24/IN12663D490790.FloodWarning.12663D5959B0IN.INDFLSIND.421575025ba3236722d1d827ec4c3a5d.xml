<headline>Flood Warning issued March 24 at 12:04PM EDT until March 25 at 7:00PM EDT by NWS Indianapolis</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in Indiana...
White River from Centerton to Hazleton.
Eel River at Bowling Green.
Mississinewa River near Ridgeville.
.Rainfall totals of an inch to an inch and a half north of I-70 and
two to three inches along and south of there over the past two days
will  combine with additional rainfall tonight to produce moderate
river flooding along the lower White River and nearby tributaries.
Widespread minor river flooding is expected along the Wabash and
East Fork White, with potential for moderate flooding at Seymour on
the East Fork White. Until the heavy rainfall exits the area late
tonight there remains potential for locally heavy rain to make the
flooding worse over southern parts of central Indiana.
The crests on the Wabash, White, and East Fork White are expected to
arrive on upper portions of the rivers early to late in the weekend
and start working their way downriver. Minor flooding is expected to
last on main stem rivers well into next week.
