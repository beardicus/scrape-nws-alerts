<description>...A BAND OF MODERATE SNOW WILL MOVE ACROSS NORTHERN BERKELEY
COUNTY THROUGH 830 AM...
A band of moderate to locally heavy snow extending from southeast
of Manning to Saint Stephen will move across northern Berkeley
County through 830 AM. Locations from Saint Stephen to Bonneau and
Alvin could see a quick 1/2 inch of snow and reduced visibilities
of 1 to 2 miles as this band moves through. Webcams along I-95
near Manning continue to show this band has dropped enough snow to
quickly cover the ground. Motorists traveling along Highway 42
and along Highway 52 near Saint Stephen should be alert for
possible slick spots.
If you observe snow, please let the National Weather Service know
by calling 888-383-2024 or you can email the report to
nws.charlestonsc@noaa.gov</description>
<instruction>If you plan to drive or walk, remain alert for slick spots on
paved surfaces. Slow your driving speed and use care when walking
on sidewalks, driveways or parking lots. Slips and falls
constitute a leading cause of injuries during winter weather.</instruction>
