<instruction>A Winter Storm Warning for snow means severe winter weather
conditions will make travel extremely dangerous. If you must
travel, keep an extra flashlight, food and water in your vehicle
in case of an emergency.
A Wind Chill Advisory means that cold air and the wind will
combine to create low wind chills. Frostbite and hypothermia can
occur if precautions are not taken. Make sure you wear a hat and
gloves.
