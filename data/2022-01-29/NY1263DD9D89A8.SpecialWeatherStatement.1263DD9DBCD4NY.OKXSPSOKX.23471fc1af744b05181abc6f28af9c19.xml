<description>...BLIZZARD CONDITIONS AND VERY HEAVY SNOW IN WESTERN SUFFOLK
COUNTY...
HAZARDS...Very heavy snow and blizzard conditions. A band of very
heavy snow accompanied by north winds of up to 45 mph, with whiteout
conditions, with near zero visibility, and considerable blowing and
drifting of snow. This band of heavy snow is producing very heavy
snow at the rate of 2 to 4 inches per hour.
LOCATION AND MOVEMENT...At 1011 AM EST, the band of very heavy snow
was over most of western Suffolk County, between Huntington and
Mount Sinai on the north shore, between Melville and Farmingville
along the Long Island Expressway, and between Babylon and Patchogue
on the south shore. The heavy snow band was nearly stationary.
LOCATIONS IMPACTED INCLUDE...
Islip, Brentwood, Commack, Huntington Station, Centereach, Deer Park,
Hauppauge, Ronkonkoma, Stony Brook, Babylon, Patchogue, Port
Jefferson, Northport, Robert Moses State Park and Coram.
SAFETY INFO...
The snow will accumulate so rapidly that it will be extremely
difficult for road crews to keep roads clear. Travel is strongly
discouraged! If you must travel, bring a winter survival kit. If you
become stranded, stay with your vehicle.
