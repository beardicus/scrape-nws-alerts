<description>...LOCAL AREA EMERGENCY FOR JACKSON COUNTY UNTIL 10 AM CST...
THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE IS TRANSMITTED AT THE REQUEST OF THE
JACKSON COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY SCOTTSBORO AL.
TRAVEL IS NOT RECOMMENDED DUE TO SNOW AND ICY ROAD CONDITIONS.
IN ADDITION TO SNOW COVER, BLACK ICE HAS ALSO DEVELOPED QUICKLY ON
AREA ROADWAYS DUE TO REFREEZING OF MELTED SNOW AS VEHICLES TRAVEL
ON THEM. THIS IS CAUSING A VERY HAZARDOUS SITUATION ON MANY AREA
ROADS, PARTICULARLY ON THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.
SOME OF THE ROADS THAT ARE BEING AFFECTED INCLUDE ALABAMA HIGHWAYS
71 AND 73, COUNTY ROADS 14, 696 AND 314. ALL ROADS NORTHEAST OF
ROSALIE ARE BEING REPORTED VERY ICY AND DANGEROUS FOR TRAVEL.</description>
