<headline>Special Weather Statement issued January 29 at 12:26AM EST  by NWS Philadelphia - Mount Holly</headline>
<description>...Heavy snow and increasing winds are expected to produce rapidly
deteriorating conditions during the overnight hours...
At 1220 am, radar indicated a band of heavy snow extending from
Caroline County in Maryland and Sussex County in Delaware north-
northeast to Monmouth County in New Jersey. Spotters and the
public have reported heavy snow rates with this band, exceeding
one to two inches per hour. The band is nearly stationary,
suggesting that heavy snow accumulations are likely in this
corridor during the overnight hours. Additionally, a second band
of heavy snow appears to be developing near the southern New
Jersey coast. Winds have increased considerably along the coast in
the past couple of hours, with reductions in visibility to a half
mile or less in several spots. Blizzard conditions are likely to
develop in the next few hours in these areas, with severe
reductions in visibility and nearly impossible travel conditions.
Travel is strongly discouraged in southern New Jersey, central and
southern Delaware, and northeast Maryland through the morning
hours. If you must travel, bring a winter survival kit. If you
become stranded, stay with your vehicle.</description>
