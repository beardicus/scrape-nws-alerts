<headline>Wind Chill Advisory issued January 29 at 4:03AM EST until January 29 at 1:00PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...WIND CHILL ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM EST THIS AFTERNOON...
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 AM EST THIS
MORNING...
* WHAT...For the Winter Weather Advisory, snow. Additional snow
accumulations of up to one inch. Winds gusting as high as 50
mph. For the Wind Chill Advisory, very cold wind chills. Wind
chills will dip as low as 15 below zero, mainly in higher
elevations.
* WHERE...Buncombe and Northern Jackson Counties.
* WHEN...For the Winter Weather Advisory, until 7 AM EST this
morning. For the Wind Chill Advisory, until 1 PM EST this
afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Gusty winds could
bring down tree branches. The cold wind chills could result in
hypothermia if precautions are not taken.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Visibility may drop as low as a quarter
mile during the passage of heavier snow bands, making driving
conditions especially dangerous. Extremely cold wind chills can
cause serious health problems including hypothermia and rapid
frostbite during short time periods without proper precautions
taken. If you must spend extended periods outdoors, cover
extremities and be conscious of body temperature.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Weather Advisory for snow means that periods of snow
will cause primarily travel difficulties. Be prepared for snow
covered roads and limited visibilities, and use caution while
driving.
A Wind Chill Advisory means that very cold air and strong winds
will combine to generate low wind chills. This will result in
frost bite and lead to hypothermia if precautions are not taken.
If you must venture outdoors, make sure you wear a hat and
gloves.
