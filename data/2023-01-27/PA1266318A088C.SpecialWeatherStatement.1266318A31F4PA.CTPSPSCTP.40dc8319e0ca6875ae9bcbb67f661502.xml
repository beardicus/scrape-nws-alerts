<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WILL AFFECT PARTS OF COLUMBIA AND SCHUYLKILL
COUNTIES...
HAZARDS...A snow squall accompanied by winds of 20 MPH which can
rapidly reduce visibility to less than a quarter of a mile.
LOCATION AND MOVEMENT...At 438 AM EST, a snow squall was along a line
extending from near Berwick to 10 miles northwest of Allentown and
moving southeast at 10 MPH.
THIS SQUALL WILL BE NEAR...
Delano, Grier City-Park Crest and Mcadoo around 540 AM EST.
Tamaqua and Hometown around 545 AM EST.
For those driving on Interstate 80, this includes areas between the
Buckhorn and Nescopek exits, specifically from mile markers 235 to
247.
This includes Interstate 81 from mile markers 132 to 139.
This includes the following highways...
Route 11 from Bloomsburg to west of Berwick.
Route 209 from west of Tamaqua to Tamaqua.
State Road 309 from McAdoo to south of Tamaqua.
SAFETY INFO...
Use extra caution if you must travel into or through this squall.
Rapid changes in visibility and potentially slick roads may lead to
accidents.
Icy roads are possible as the snow melts on the roadway and then
quickly refreezes.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time to reach your destination.
