<headline>High Wind Watch issued January 27 at 5:40AM AKST until January 29 at 9:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
SUNDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Winds 50 to 65 mph with gusts up to 75 mph possible.
* WHERE...Western Aleutians.
* WHEN...From Saturday afternoon through Sunday morning.
* IMPACTS...High winds could move loose debris, damage property,
and cause power outages. Travel could be difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A period of strong east to southeasterly
winds are likely Saturday afternoon and evening as a deep North
Pacific low pushes a front through the western Aleutians. Expect
winds to diminish somewhat Saturday evening as they shift
southerly before a second round of potentially high south to
southwesterly winds arrives on the back side of the low early
Sunday morning.</description>
<instruction>A high wind watch means there is potential for a hazardous high
wind event. Monitor the latest forecasts and warnings for updates
on this situation. Fasten loose objects or shelter objects in a
safe location prior to the onset of winds.</instruction>
