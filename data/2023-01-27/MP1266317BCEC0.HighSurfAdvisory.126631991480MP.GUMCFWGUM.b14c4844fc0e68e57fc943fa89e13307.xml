<headline>High Surf Advisory issued January 27 at 2:16AM ChST until January 28 at 6:00PM ChST by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 PM CHST THIS AFTERNOON
ALONG NORTH AND WEST FACING REEFS...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO 6 PM
CHST SATURDAY ALONG NORTH AND WEST FACING REEFS...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM CHST SATURDAY ALONG
EAST FACING REEFS...
...HIGH RISK OF RIP CURRENTS THROUGH SATURDAY AFTERNOON ALONG
NORTH, WEST, AND EAST FACING REEFS...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking
waves of 11 to 16 feet in the surf zone. For the High Surf
Advisory, large breaking waves of 8 to 13 feet expected in the
surf zone. For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip
currents.
* WHERE...For North and West facing reefs, High Surf Warning until
2pm Friday, then a High Surf Advisory until 6pm Saturday. For
East facing reefs, High Surf Advisory. Dangerous rip currents
for north, west and east facing reefs.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Warning, until 2 PM ChST this
afternoon. For the High Surf Advisory, until 6 PM ChST
Saturday. For the High Rip Current Risk, through Saturday
afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Breaking waves can sweep people off jetties and
docks, and into dangerous seas. Life-threatening swimming
conditions and significant beach erosion can be expected. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Recent buoy and altimetry data showing the
northerly swell coming in a bit higher than forecast and
therefore expecting waves through the morning to be high enough
for High Surf Warning, then decreasing this afternoon.</description>
<instruction>Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other waterside
infrastructure.
If caught in a rip current, relax and float. Don`t swim against
the current. If able, swim in a direction following the shoreline.
If unable to escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
