FOR THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS LATE FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...
.Light snow will decrease towards dawn with a lull in the snowfall

Mountain NP). Additionally, strong winds will be present at times

treacherous conditions for most mountains passes/roadways.

Friday, and will lead to deteriorated conditions coinciding with
weekend ski traffic.
