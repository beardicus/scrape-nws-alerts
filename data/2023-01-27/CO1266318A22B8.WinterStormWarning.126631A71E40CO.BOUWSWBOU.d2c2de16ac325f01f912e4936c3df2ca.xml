<description>...PROLONGED PERIOD OF HEAVY SNOW AND HAZARDOUS TRAVEL CONDITIONS
FOR THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS LATE FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...
.Light snow will decrease towards dawn with a lull in the snowfall
expected Friday morning. Snow will increase in coverage and
intensity later Friday afternoon and night with arrival of next shot
of energy and deeper moisture. The heaviest snow will impact the
Park Range, including Rabbit Ears Pass, and to a slightly lesser
extent the northern Front Range mountains (Medicine Bow Range, Rocky
Mountain NP). Additionally, strong winds will be present at times
through Friday night, resulting in blowing snow, poor visibility and
treacherous conditions for most mountains passes/roadways.
Lighter snow will impact the I-70 mountain corridor beginning
Friday, and will lead to deteriorated conditions coinciding with
weekend ski traffic.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM MST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Light snow this morning will become heavy snow in the
afternoon and will last through tonight. For the Park Range,
expect storm total snow accumulations of 16 to 26 inches. For the
Medicine Bow Range and Rocky Mountain NP, expect storm total snow
accumulations of 10 to 15 inches for the higher elevations. Winds
gusting as high as 60 mph over the higher peaks.
* WHERE...Rabbit Ears Pass, Rocky Mountain National Park and the
Medicine Bow Range.
* WHEN...Until 5 PM MST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible from late
Friday through Saturday. Gusty winds could bring down tree
branches.</description>
