<description>...COLD WEATHER WILL CAUSE ICE FORMATION ON THE MISSOURI RIVER...
With another stretch of cold temperatures in store through the
weekend and into next week, it appears that the Missouri River is
making another attempt to initiate ice along the Burleigh and Morton
counties reach of the river. Ice sheets are moving through the
Bismarck and Mandan area of the river. What is uncertain, is whether
or not these ice sheets will get caught up in the sharp meanders in
the river near the University of Mary. If so, we can expect water
level rises and icing up beginning as early as this weekend. If not,
temperatures still appear cold enough that ice will form in the
river channel in the Bismarck and Mandan area by the middle of next
week.
Over the past 10 years, we have seen between 5 and 7 feet of rise in
water levers during a complete icing over of the river, often within
24 hours. The Missouri River gage at Bismarck is currently around
4.5 feet and even though a great amount of uncertainty always exists
with ice affected water levels, recent history would suggest that
even a complete icing over of the river would keep water levels
below the flood stage of 14.5 feet.</description>
