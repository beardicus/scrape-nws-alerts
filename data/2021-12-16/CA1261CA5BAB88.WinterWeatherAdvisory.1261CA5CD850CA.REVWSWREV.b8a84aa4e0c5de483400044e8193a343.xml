<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 16 at 5:30AM PST until December 16 at 1:00PM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM PST THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 2 to 6
inches, with one to two feet in the High Sierra west of
Highway 395. Winds gusting as high as 50 mph in wind prone
locations along Highway 395 and up to 100 mph across Sierra
Ridges.
* WHERE...Mono County.
* WHEN...From 7 PM this evening to 1 PM PST Thursday. Peak
snowfall rates from midnight through 8 am Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult across the Eastern
Sierra. The hazardous conditions will impact the Thursday
morning commute. Delays likely with road closures possible.
Strong winds could cause tree damage and power outages. Expect
periods of poor visibility in blowing snow.</description>
<instruction>Even light snowfall causes major travel delays, especially during
periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to
reach your destination. Leave extra space between vehicles since
it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
