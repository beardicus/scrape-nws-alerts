Flood Warning for the following rivers in Indiana...
Wabash River and Tippecanoe River.
.Rain, heavy at times, is expected to move into the region tonight

inches are expected. This rainfall in addition to snow melt will
lead to flooding along area rivers. Lowland and minor flooding is

parts of the upper Wabash. Another system early next week could
lengthen the amount of time in flood and make the flooding worse
than currently forecast.
