Illinois...
Tippecanoe River, Mississinewa River, Wabash River, Wildcat Creek,
Wabash River at Riverton affecting Sullivan, Knox, Crawford and

.Temperatures well above normal have caused snow pack to melt, and
this along with mostly frozen ground is bringing flooding to central
Indiana streams and creeks.  Rain that is currently moving into
central Indiana is expected to become moderate to heavy in intensity
tonight and Thursday, which will exacerbate flooding.  Between 1.5
and 2.9 inches of liquid or liquid equivalent is forecast to fall
during this storm system.  Another system early next week could
lengthen the amount of time in flood and produce additional rises on
area rivers.
