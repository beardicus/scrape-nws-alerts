<headline>Flood Watch issued February 16 at 3:44PM EST until February 18 at 9:00AM EST by NWS Binghamton</headline>
<description>.Heavy rain may fall on a deep primed snowpack leading to the melt
increasing. Flows in rivers may increase quickly and reach critical
levels.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY MORNING THROUGH FRIDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt is possible. Ice jams
may occur.
* WHERE...Portions of central New York and northeast Pennsylvania,
including the following areas, in central New York, Sullivan. In
northeast Pennsylvania, Bradford, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Northern
Wayne, Susquehanna and Wyoming.
* WHEN...From Thursday morning through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Much warmer temperatures will cause significant snowmelt. A
half inch to inch of rainfall is also forecast, with more
possible in higher terrain. The peak time for both rain and
snowmelt will be Thursday afternoon through Thursday night,
though any resulting flood problems may linger through
Friday. Significant rises in streams and rivers, may lead to
ice breakup and possible ice jams. Bridges, narrows, and
sharp turns in streams can all cause pinch points for ice
jams. When ice jams occur, flooding can quickly result.
