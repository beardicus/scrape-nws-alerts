<headline>Flood Watch issued February 16 at 10:50AM EST until February 18 at 12:00AM EST by NWS Chicago</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM CST /7 PM EST/ THIS
EVENING THROUGH THURSDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by heavy rain, snowmelt, and break-up ice
jams continues to be possible.
* WHERE...Portions of east central Illinois and northwest Indiana,
including the following areas, in east central Illinois, Ford and
Iroquois. In northwest Indiana, Benton, Jasper and Newton.
* WHEN...From this evening through Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Some rivers are
forecast to go above flood stage based upon current forecast
rainfall. Rising river levels may result in river ice becoming
dislodged, increasing the risk of localized break-up ice jams.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rainfall of one to one and a half inches is expected tonight
into Thursday morning in addition to runoff from melting
snow. Frozen ground may lead to quick runoff.

upon the latest forecasts. Persons with interests along area rivers,
creeks, and other waterways should monitor the latest forecasts and
be prepared to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
