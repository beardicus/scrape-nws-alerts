<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued February 16 at 5:13AM AKST until February 16 at 9:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM AKST THIS
MORNING...
* WHAT...Snow, freezing rain, and rain expected. Total snow
accumulations of 2 to 4 inches, with locally higher amounts
along the Glenn Highway and across the Upper Hillside.
* WHERE...Anchorage.
* WHEN...From 1 AM to 9 AM AKST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning and evening commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow and freezing drizzle will overspread
the Anchorage Bowl early this morning. The heaviest snow is
expected just prior to or during the morning commute. A
southeasterly Turnagain Arm wind is expected to move across the
western half of Anchorage by mid-morning, allowing temperatures
to climb above freezing. Temperatures along the Upper Hillside
will also climb above freezing through the morning hours as
southeasterly winds increase. The increase in winds and
temperatures will likely change snow to rain by mid to late
morning, limiting snow accumulation. The rain or rain/snow mix
will continue through Wednesday afternoon before winds diminish
and temperatures fall back around freezing, allowing for a
changeover back to snow before the precipitation tapers off late
this evening.</description>
