<description>...Heavy Rainfall and Shifting River Ice Remain Possible...
Warmer temperatures today will be followed by widespread rainfall
this evening into tomorrow, some of which may be heavy in localized
areas. A combination of snow melt and rainfall could lead to
significant river rises in some areas, including water levels near
flood stage. Isolated break-up ice jams may also occur. This flood
potential exists from today through the weekend. Confidence in heavy
rainfall and flooding has decreased slightly since previous outlooks.
Snow cover has begun quickly melting over the last 12 hours and is
expected to be almost entirely melted by tomorrow morning. Soil
frost depths range from 6 to 12 inches across the outlook area,
which may be enough to reduce infiltration from rainfall and snow
melt. Soil moisture across the area is near average, which will not
significantly impact flood risk. Overall, conditions are generally
leading to an increased rate of runoff due to rainfall.
River forecasts based upon 48 hours of future rainfall indicate
significant river rises and near flood stage conditions at multiple
locations along the Iroquois, Kankakee, and Illinois rivers and
their tributaries. River rises from a combination of ongoing snow
melt and future rainfall are likely to break up ice cover in some
areas, which may lead to isolated break-up ice jams. Ice jams can
develop quickly and lead to rapid water level fluctuations with
little or no notice.
This outlook means that elevated water levels and potential impacts
are possible, but not yet certain. Persons should closely monitor
the latest forecasts and statements, including possible flood
watches and warnings.
No additional outlooks are expected for this event.</description>
