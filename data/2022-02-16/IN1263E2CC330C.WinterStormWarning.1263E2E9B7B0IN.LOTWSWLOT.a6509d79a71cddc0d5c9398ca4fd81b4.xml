<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM TO 9 PM CST
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...A period of accumulating freezing rain and sleet Thursday
morning is expected. A period of heavy snowfall is expected to
develop Thursday afternoon and continue into early Thursday
evening. Total snow accumulations of 3 to 7 inches and ice
accumulations up to one tenth of an inch. Winds gusting as high
as 40 mph.
* WHERE...In Indiana, Newton and Jasper Counties. In Illinois,
Iroquois and Ford Counties.
* WHEN...From 8 AM to 9 PM CST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions developing during the
morning Thursday. Travel during the afternoon and evening will
become very difficult as wind driven, heavy, wet snow will
result in treacherous road conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Heavy snowfall rates, greater than one inch
per hour at times, are expected Thursday afternoon. This combined
with winds gusting as high as 40 mph will likely result in
sharply reduced visibility. The heavy wet nature of the snow
could also put strain on tree limbs and power lines which may
result in some power outages.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
