<headline>Flood Watch issued February 16 at 3:16PM EST until February 18 at 9:00AM EST by NWS Burlington</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
FRIDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and/or snowmelt and/or ice jam
continues to be possible.
* WHERE...Northern New York and Vermont
* WHEN...From Thursday afternoon through Friday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Low-water
crossings may be flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The combination of snow melt and moderate to heavy rainfall
will cause sharp rises on many streams and rivers. A few
river gages may approach minor flood stage by Friday. In
addition, these expected rises will produce some ice break
up, increasing the risk of localized ice jam related flooding
on Thursday Night into Friday. Some rivers we are watching
closely include, the Ausable, Saranac, Salmon, Lamoille,
Winooski, Mad, and Otter Creek. Precipitation forecasts have
increased across the region, with portions of northern New
York approaching 2 inches, with locally higher amounts up to
2 and a half inches. This may also result in flooding outside
mainstem rivers across portions of northern New York.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
