<headline>Flood Watch issued February 16 at 3:12AM EST until February 16 at 10:00PM EST by NWS Buffalo</headline>
<description>.The combination of run-off from snow melt and rain will cause
levels on creeks and rivers to rise, potentially resulting in
flooding.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THIS EVENING THROUGH FRIDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of western New York, including the following
counties, Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Genesee, Livingston,
Monroe, Niagara, Northern Erie, Orleans, Southern Erie and Wyoming.
* WHEN...From this evening through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
The greatest threat for flooding will be in ice jam prone areas,
such as the Buffalo area creeks and near Sunset Bay on Cattaraugus
creek. Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding
may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Warm weather through Thursday will result in significant
melting of the extensive snow pack over the region. A storm
system will generate between an inch and inch and a half of
rain over western New York, most of which will come from
midday Thursday into Thursday evening. The combination of the
significant rainfall and extensive snow melt may cause
flooding along creeks and rivers.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop. This is especially the case
for those living in ice jam prone areas along the Buffalo area
creeks and Cattaraugus creek. Others that have experienced ice jam
flooding in the past should also be extra vigilant during this
period.</instruction>
