<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued September 21 at 6:44PM MDT until September 21 at 9:15PM MDT by NWS Saltlake</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Salt Lake City has extended the
* Flash Flood Warning for...
The Jacob City burn scar in...
Eastern Tooele County in northern Utah...
* Until 915 PM MDT.
* At 644 PM MDT, local law enforcement reported a flash flood wave
reaching SR 36 just south of Stockton, and mud flows breaching the
main channel of Soldier Creek within Soldier Canyon. SR 36 is now
closed in both directions. Between 0.25 and 0.75 inches of rain
have fallen over the burn scar from earlier thunderstorms, and
additional thunderstorms are moving over the burn scar at this
time. Flash flooding is already occurring.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through the Soldier Creek. The debris flow can consist of
rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms
producing flash flooding in and around the Jacob City
Burn Scar.
SOURCE...Law enforcement reported.
IMPACT...Life threatening flash flooding of areas in and around
the Jacob City Burn Scar.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Soldier Canyon and SR 36 just south of the town of Stockton.
FLASH FLOOD...OBSERVED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry washes is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.</instruction>
