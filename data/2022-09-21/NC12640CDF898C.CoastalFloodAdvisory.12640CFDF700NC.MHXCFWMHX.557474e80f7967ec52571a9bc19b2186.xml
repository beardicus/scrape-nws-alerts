<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM 7 AM EDT THURSDAY
THROUGH THURSDAY EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 5 PM THURSDAY TO
8 PM EDT FRIDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 5 PM THURSDAY TO
8 PM EDT FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, 1 to 2 feet of inundation
above ground level expected in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking
waves of 6 to 10 feet expected in the surf zone. For the Beach
Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents and large breaking
waves expected in the surf zone.
* WHERE...East Carteret County, and Ocracoke Island and Hatteras
Island.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory and High Surf Advisory,
from 5 PM Thursday to 8 PM EDT Friday. For the Beach Hazards
Statement, from 7 AM EDT Thursday through Thursday evening.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only isolated
road closures expected. Dangerous swimming and surfing
conditions and localized beach erosion.
Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore
into deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw a swimmer or
surfer head first into the bottom causing neck and back
injuries.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Swell from Major Hurricane Fiona will
bring dangerous surf to beaches from Cape Lookout North to
south of Oregon Inlet. Seas build to 5-8 feet by late Thursday
morning and then 6-10 feet by Thursday evening with seas
remaining above 8 feet until Friday evening. Minor ocean
overwash will also be possible across oceanside beaches
including Rodanthe, Hatteras, and Ocracoke.
Dangerous rip currents will be possible throughout the day, but
may become most prevalent around the hours of low tide, which
will be noon.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
