<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING FOR THE JACOB CITY BURN SCAR REMAINS IN
EFFECT UNTIL 715 PM MDT THIS EVENING FOR EASTERN TOOELE COUNTY...
At 536 PM MDT, local law enforcement reported a flash flood wave
reaching SR 36 just south of Stockton, and mud flows breaching the
main channel of Soldier Creek within Soldier Canyon. 1 house has
been evacuated, and the northbound lane on SR 36 has been closed in
the area. Between 0.25 and 0.75 inches of rain have fallen over the
burn scar from earlier thunderstorms. Flash flooding is already
occurring.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through the Soldier Creek. The debris flow can consist of
rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms producing
flash flooding in and around the Jacob City Burn Scar.
SOURCE...Law enforcement reported.
IMPACT...Life threatening flash flooding of areas in and around
the Jacob City Burn Scar.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Soldier Canyon and SR 36 just south of the town of Stockton.
FLASH FLOOD...OBSERVED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry washes is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.</instruction>
