<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued September 21 at 4:17PM MDT until September 21 at 7:15PM MDT by NWS Saltlake</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Salt Lake City has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
The Jacob City burn scar in...
Eastern Tooele County in northern Utah...
* Until 715 PM MDT.
* At 417 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing
heavy rain over the Jacob City Burn Scar. Flash flooding is
ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in flash flooding
and debris flows which will cross the county road in Soldier Canyon
then move into and downstream Soldier Creek. Flows are then expected
to move downstream in Soldier Creek to SR 36 near mm 47 and the
adjacent UPR rail line. The debris flow can consist of rock, mud,
vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms
producing flash flooding in and around the Jacob City
Burn Scar.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Life threatening flash flooding of areas in and around
the Jacob City Burn Scar.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Soldier Canyon and Stockton.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry washes is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.</instruction>
