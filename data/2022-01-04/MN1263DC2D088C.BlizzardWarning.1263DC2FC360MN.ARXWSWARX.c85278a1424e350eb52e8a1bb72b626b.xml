<headline>Blizzard Warning issued January 04 at 6:11PM CST until January 05 at 12:00PM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Significant Wind, Blowing Snow, and Whiteout Impacts Expected
Tonight into Wednesday...
.A winter storm brings accumulating snow and strong winds to the
region starting between 9 pm and 3 am and persisting through
Wednesday morning before conditions slowly improve in the
afternoon. Winds will gust to 45 mph across much of the area from
late tonight through Wednesday morning, with some higher gusts to
50 mph at times west of the Mississippi River. Combined with
falling snow, these strong winds will lead to significant
reductions in visibility with periodic whiteout conditions,
especially in rural, open areas. Wind-prone areas of southeast
Minnesota will be especially susceptible to prolonged poor
visibility and strong winds where a Blizzard Warning is in effect.
Accumulating snow will be highest north of I-94 where 3 to 7
inches is expected, though winds will be a bit lighter over
north-central WI. Generally 1 to 3&quot; expected between I-90 and
I-94 with an inch or less south of I-90.
There will be travel impacts, including the Wednesday morning
commute. Plan now and be prepared to adjust travel if conditions
warrant it. Isolated power outages will be possible.
...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM THIS EVENING TO
NOON CST WEDNESDAY...
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON TO 6 PM
CST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions expected with winds gusting as high
as 50 mph and whiteout conditions in blowing snow. Total snow
accumulations of up to two inches.
* WHERE...Dodge, Olmsted, Mower and Fillmore Counties.
* WHEN...Conditions steadily deteriorate between 9pm and 3am, with
the worst conditions expected from 3 am to 9 am Wednesday
morning. Visibilities steadily improve through the day as the
snow shifts out of the region. Strong winds look to persist for
the bulk of the day.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Blowing snow will
significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions will
impact the morning commute. Gusty winds could bring down tree
branches and cause isolated power outages. Cold wind chills as
low as 20 below zero could cause frostbite on exposed skin in
as little as 30 minutes.</description>
<instruction>Travel should be restricted to emergencies only. If you must
travel, slow down and use extra caution. Have a winter survival
kit with you. If you get stranded, stay with your vehicle.
For the latest road conditions, check 511ia.org in Iowa,
511mn.org in Minnesota, and 511wi.gov in Wisconsin.</instruction>
