<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 04 at 11:11AM CST until January 05 at 6:00PM CST by NWS QuadCities</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM THIS
EVENING TO 6 PM CST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Blowing snow expected. Winds of 15 to 25 mph, gusting as
high as 45 mph are expected. Bitterly cold wind chills are
expected the entire time.
* WHERE...Portions of northeast Missouri, east central,
northeast and southeast Iowa and northwest and west central
Illinois.
* WHEN...From 9 PM this evening to 6 PM CST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Patchy blowing snow could significantly reduce
visibility, especially in rural areas. This may cause roads to
become snow covered again and make travel difficult across the
advisory area. The hazardous conditions could impact the
morning and evening commute. Bitterly cold wind chills as low
as 20 below zero could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as
little as 30 minutes. The winds could blow around unsecured
items.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Some flurries or even light snow showers
are possible north of Highway 30. Little to no accumulation is
expected at this time.</description>
<instruction>Use caution while traveling, especially in open areas.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1 for
Iowa, or by visiting 511ia.org, modot.org, or idot.Illinois.gov.</instruction>
