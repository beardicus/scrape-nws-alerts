MORNING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM THIS MORNING TO
3 PM EST THIS AFTERNOON...

threat of property damage. Expect around one foot of water above
ground level in low lying, vulnerable areas. Some roads and low
lying property including parking lots, parks and lawns near the
waterfront will experience shallow flooding. Large breaking
waves of 7 to 8 feet will result in dangerous surf conditions.
Do not enter or approach the water due to the risk of being
swept away.</description>
<instruction>A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in
the advisory area...producing localized beach erosion and
dangerous swimming conditions.
A Coastal Flood Advisory means that onshore winds...wave action
and/or tides will combine to create flooding of low areas along
the shore...and near tidal rivers and creeks. Be prepared for the
possibility of road closures and minor flooding of properties. If
travel is necessary...do not attempt to drive through water of
unknown depth.</instruction>
