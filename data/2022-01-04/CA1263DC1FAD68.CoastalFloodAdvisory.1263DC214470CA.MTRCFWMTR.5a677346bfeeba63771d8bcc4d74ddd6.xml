<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued January 04 at 4:58AM PST until January 04 at 3:00PM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>...LOCALIZED COASTAL FLOODING DURING HIGH TIDE TUESDAY AS THE
SUBSIDING KING TIDES MERGE WITH BUILDING SEAS AND STORM SURGE...
.The highest astronomical tides of the year, commonly referred to
as the King Tides, have peaked and will begin to subside,
however, localized coastal flooding will continue to be possible
during high tide (9AM to 3PM depending on location) today along
the low lying portions of the Bayshore and Pacific coast. This is
due to an increase in the water level from a combination of the
subsiding King Tides, a building northwest swell of 10 to 15 feet,
and minor increases from storm surge. Monday`s peak tidal gauge
readings were slightly higher than forecast, an indication that
these offsetting factors have already begun to impact water
levels.
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM THIS
MORNING TO 3 PM PST THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Minor coastal flooding expected at prone low lying
coastal locations across the San Francisco Bay shoreline
during peak high tide through Monday.
* WHERE...Low lying portions of the San Francisco Bayshore.
Localized impacts are also possible in low lying areas along
the Pacific shore as well, such as near Elkhorn Slough.
* WHEN...From 9 AM to 3 PM PST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of areas previously impacted by King Tide
events is expected, including low lying lots, parks, and roads
throughout the San Francisco Bay Shoreline with the highest
high tides.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Tidal levels are forecast to subside but
rising seas due to building swell and storm surge will offset
the differences during high tide on Tuesday. Thus, localized
flooding of low lying coastal locations is possible again
Tuesday from 9AM to 3PM. Check local tide forecasts for high
tide times as these can vary and occur anywhere between mid
morning to early afternoon.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
