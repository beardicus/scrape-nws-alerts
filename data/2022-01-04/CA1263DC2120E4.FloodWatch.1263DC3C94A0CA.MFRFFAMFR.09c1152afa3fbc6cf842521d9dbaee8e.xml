<description>.A series of fronts will bring periods of moderate to heavy
precipitation totaling 2 to 6 inches of water over much of
southwestern Oregon and far northwestern California into Wednesday,
January 5th. Snow levels will rise during this time period leading
to melting of the lower elevation snowpack across the area. This
will lead to rapid rises on area streams, creeks, and rivers, as
well as possible flooding during this time period.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH WEDNESDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Rapid water level rises and possible localized flooding
caused by excessive rainfall and snow melt is possible.

including the following counties, in northern California, Western
Siskiyou County. In southwest Oregon, Central Douglas County,
Curry County Coast, Eastern Curry County and Josephine County and
South Central Oregon Coast.
* WHEN...Through Wednesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Low-water
crossings may be flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- 1 to 2 inches of rain fell over the last 24 hours with
additional runoff from low elevation snowmelt. An additional
1 to 2 inches of rain through tonight will lead to the
possibility of localized flooding of streams, creeks, and low
lying areas.
