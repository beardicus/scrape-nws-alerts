<description>...PM-2.5 HIGH POLLUTION ADVISORY FOR SANTA CRUZ COUNTY INCLUDING
NOGALES TODAY...
The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) in Phoenix has
issued a PM-2.5 High Pollution Advisory for Santa Cruz County Area
for Tuesday.
This means that ongoing stagnant weather conditions may result in
local PM-2.5 concentrations that pose a health risk. Adverse health
effects increase as air quality deteriorates.
Fine particulate matter - also known as PM-2.5 - is an air
contaminant that can aggravate heart and lung disease conditions,
especially in older adults, children, and those with asthma. A
decrease in physical activity is recommended.
Consolidate your travel, reduce or eliminate fireplace use, refrain
from outdoor burning, and avoid using gas-powered lawn equipment.
For details on this High Pollution Advisory for Santa Cruz County,
visit the ADEQ internet site at www.azdeq.gov or call 602-771-2300.</description>
