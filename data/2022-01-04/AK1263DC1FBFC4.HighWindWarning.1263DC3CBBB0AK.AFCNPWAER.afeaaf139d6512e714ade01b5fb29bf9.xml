<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AKST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Northeast winds 25 to 40 mph with gusts of 50 to 65 mph
expected. Periods of reduced visibility possible due to blowing
snow.
* WHERE...Matanuska Valley.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM AKST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...High winds will continue to sweep away loose debris,
damage property, and cause power outages. Travel will be
difficult, especially for high profile vehicles. Tie down
small aircraft. Crosswinds may also cause issues for aircraft.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Northeast winds will persist through
Wednesday. Wind chill values from 20 below to 35 below zero are
expected with these winds. This could cause dangerous life-
threatening conditions for those without power, as frostbite can
develop in as little as 15 minutes in these conditions.</description>

around or damaged by the wind. Prepare for the possibility of
widespread power outages. Use caution if you must drive.</instruction>
