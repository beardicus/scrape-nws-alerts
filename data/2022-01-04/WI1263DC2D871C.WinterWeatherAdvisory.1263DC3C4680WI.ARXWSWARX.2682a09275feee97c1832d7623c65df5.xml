<description>...Significant Wind, Blowing Snow, and Whiteout Impacts Expected
Tonight into Wednesday...
.A winter storm brings accumulating snow and strong winds to the
region tonight and persists through Wednesday morning before
conditions slowly improve in the afternoon. Winds will gust to 45
mph across much of the area from late tonight through Wednesday
morning, with some higher gusts to 50 mph at times west of the
Mississippi River. Combined with falling snow, these strong winds
will lead to significant reductions in visibility with periodic
whiteout conditions, especially in rural, open areas. Wind-prone
areas of southeast Minnesota will be especially susceptible to
prolonged poor visibility and strong winds where a Blizzard
Warning is in effect. Accumulating snow will be highest north of
I-94 where 3 to 7 inches is expected, though winds will be a bit
lighter over north-central WI. Generally 1 to 3&quot; expected between
I- 90 and I-94 with an inch or less south of I-90.
There will be travel impacts, including the Wednesday morning
commute. Plan now and be prepared to adjust travel if conditions
warrant it. Isolated power outages will be possible.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM CST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Snow with total accumulations of 4 to 7 inches. Winds
gusting as high as 35 mph will cause blowing snow and near
whiteout conditions at times in open areas.
* WHERE...Taylor and Clark Counties.
* WHEN...Conditions steadily deteriorate before midnight, with
the worst conditions expected from midnight to noon Wednesday.
Snow lightens in the afternoon but should linger through the
remainder of the day.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be very difficult. Blowing snow will
significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions will
impact the morning commute.</description>
