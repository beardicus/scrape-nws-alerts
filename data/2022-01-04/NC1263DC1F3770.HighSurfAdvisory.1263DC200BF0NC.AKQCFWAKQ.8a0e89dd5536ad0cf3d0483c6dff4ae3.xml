<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM EST THIS
MORNING...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 AM EST THIS
MORNING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, one to two feet of
inundation above ground level expected in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways. For the High Surf Advisory,
breaking waves of 7 to 8 feet in the surf zone.
* WHERE...The Atlantic side of Eastern Currituck County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, until 11 AM EST this
morning. For the High Surf Advisory, until 10 AM EST this
morning.
* IMPACTS...Widespread flooding of vulnerable areas will result in
an elevated threat of property damage to homes and businesses
near the waterfront and shoreline. Water will be 1 to 2 feet
above ground level in some areas resulting in a sufficient depth
to close numerous roads and threaten homes and businesses.
Flooding will extend inland from the waterfront along tidal
rivers and bays resulting in some road closures and flooding of
vehicles. Large breaking waves of 7 to 8 feet will result in
dangerous surf conditions. Do not enter or approach the water
due to the risk of being swept away.</description>
<instruction>A Coastal Flood Warning means that flooding is occurring or
imminent. Coastal residents in the warned area should be alert
for rising water...and take appropriate action to protect life
and property. Be prepared for the possibility of road closures
and flooding of properties. If travel is necessary...do not
attempt to drive through water of unknown depth.
A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in
the advisory area...producing localized beach erosion and
dangerous swimming conditions.</instruction>
