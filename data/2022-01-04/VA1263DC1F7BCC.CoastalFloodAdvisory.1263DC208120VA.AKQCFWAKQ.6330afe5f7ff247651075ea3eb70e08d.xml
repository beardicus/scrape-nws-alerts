<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued January 04 at 6:31AM EST until January 04 at 1:00PM EST by NWS Wakefield</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM EST THIS
AFTERNOON...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM EST THIS
MORNING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, around one foot of
inundation above ground level expected in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways. For the High Surf Advisory,
breaking waves of 7 to 8 feet in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Virginia Beach.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 10 AM EST this
morning. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 1 PM EST this
afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Shallow flooding is expected in the most vulnerable
locations near the waterfront and shoreline resulting in a low
threat of property damage. Expect around one foot of water
above ground level in low lying, vulnerable areas. Some roads
and low lying property including parking lots, parks and lawns
near the waterfront will experience shallow flooding. Large
breaking waves of 7 to 8 feet will result in dangerous surf
conditions. Do not enter or approach the water due to the risk
of being swept away.</description>
<instruction>A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in
the advisory area...producing localized beach erosion and
dangerous swimming conditions.
A Coastal Flood Advisory means that onshore winds...wave action
and/or tides will combine to create flooding of low areas along
the shore...and near tidal rivers and creeks. Be prepared for the
possibility of road closures and minor flooding of properties. If
travel is necessary...do not attempt to drive through water of
unknown depth.</instruction>
