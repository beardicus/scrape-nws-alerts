<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 04 at 2:50PM CST until January 05 at 6:00PM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Significant Wind, Blowing Snow, and Whiteout Impacts Expected
Tonight into Wednesday...
.A winter storm is on track to bring accumulating snow and strong
winds to the region beginning late this evening and persisting
through Wednesday morning before conditions slowly improve into
the afternoon. Winds will gust to 45 mph across much of the area
from late tonight through Wednesday morning, with some higher
gusts to 50 mph at times west of the Mississippi River. Combined
with falling snow, these strong winds will lead to significant
reductions in visibility with whiteout conditions at times,
especially in rural, open areas. Wind-prone areas of southeast
Minnesota will be especially susceptible to prolonged poor
visibility and strong winds, which led to a Blizzard Warning
upgrade for that area. Accumulating snow will be highest north of
I-94 where 3 to 6 inches is generally expected, though winds will
be a bit lighter over north-central WI. Generally 1 to 3&quot; expected
between I-90 and I-94 with an inch or less south of I-90.
There will be travel impacts, including the Wednesday morning
commute. Plan now and be prepared to adjust travel if conditions
warrant it. Isolated power outages will be possible.
...BLIZZARD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM THIS EVENING TO NOON CST
WEDNESDAY...
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT FROM NOON TO 6 PM CST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions expected with winds gusting as high
as 50 mph and whiteout conditions in blowing snow. Total snow
accumulations of up to two inches.
* WHERE...Dodge, Olmsted, Mower and Fillmore Counties.
* WHEN...For the Blizzard Warning, from 9 PM this evening to
noon CST Wednesday. For the Winter Weather Advisory, from noon
to 6 PM CST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Blowing snow will
significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions will
impact the morning commute. Gusty winds could bring down tree
branches and cause isolated power outages. Cold wind chills as
low as 20 below zero could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as
little as 30 minutes.</description>

travel, slow down and use extra caution. Have a winter survival
kit with you. If you get stranded, stay with your vehicle.
