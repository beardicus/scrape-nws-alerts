<headline>Wind Advisory issued October 29 at 11:51AM MDT until October 29 at 2:00PM MDT by NWS Saltlake</headline>
<description>...WIND ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 PM MDT THIS AFTERNOON...
...FREEZE WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM MDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...For the Wind Advisory, northeast winds 25 to 35 mph with
gusts up to 50 mph expected. For the Freeze Warning, sub-
freezing temperatures between 28 to 32 degrees expected,
especially Monday morning.
* WHERE...Lower Washington County.
* WHEN...For the Wind Advisory, until 2 PM MDT this afternoon.
For the Freeze Warning, until 10 AM MDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Gusty winds could blow around unsecured objects. A
few power outages are possible. Travel could be difficult due
to crosswinds, especially for high profile vehicles and
vehicles with trailers. Frost and freeze conditions will kill
crops, other sensitive vegetation and possibly damage
unprotected outdoor plumbing.</description>
<instruction>Use extra caution when driving, especially if operating a high
profile vehicle. Secure outdoor objects.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
