<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT THROUGH 10 PM MONDAY EVENING FOR
GUSTY SANTA ANA WINDS AND VERY LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR MUCH OF
LOS ANGELES AND VENTURA COUNTIES...
.The first strong Santa Ana wind event of the season is now
ongoing and behaving close to expectations with widespread wind
gusts of 40 to 60 mph through the mountains valleys and some
coasts within the Santa Ana wind cooridor of LA/Ventura Counties
with isolated gusts near 70 mph. Single digit humidities will
prevail during the day with minimal recovery at night. Winds may
drop off a bit into Monday but remain on the strong side. Further
weakening is expected into Tuesday, but may remain strong enough
to support continued critical fire weather conditions (30-50
percent chance) away from the coast across wind prone portions of
Los Angeles and Ventura counties.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PDT MONDAY FOR
GUSTY SANTA ANA WINDS AND VERY LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR THE
VENTURA COUNTY AND MALIBU COASTS...
* Winds...Northeast 15 to 30 mph with gusts 50 mph, except gusts
to 60 mph in the hills above Malibu. Strongest winds on
Sunday, diminishing around 10 mph on Monday.
* Relative Humidity...Minimum humidity each day 5 to 10 percent.
Very poor humidity recoveries of 10 to 20 percent in wind
prone areas.
* Impacts...If fire ignition occurs there could be rapid spread
of wildfire that would lead to a threat to life and property.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now, or will shortly. Use extreme caution
with anything that can spark a wildfire. Residents near wildland
interfaces should be prepared to evacuate if a wildfire breaks
out. See readyforwildfire.org and wildfirerisk.org for
