<headline>Flood Warning issued October 29 at 3:48AM ADT  by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM AST THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...Rio Blanco`s basin in Naguabo.
* WHEN...Until 900 AM AST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring. Numerous roads
remain closed due to flooding. Streams continue to rise due to
excess runoff from earlier rainfall. Low-water crossings are
inundated with water and may not be passable. Expect many areas of
slow moving or standing water. It will take several hours for all
the water from these storms to work through local drainage systems
in urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 243 AM AST, Doppler radar and emergency management
indicated heavy rain across the warned area. Radar-estimated
rainfall totals from past rain is between 1 and 3 inches over
the warned area. Excessive runoff from past and current rain
will maintain Rio Blanco`s streamflow above flood stage.
Emergency Management reported ongoing flooding along Rio
Blanco`s banks, affecting road PR-191 near Sector Pitina,
Barrio Florida in Naguabo. This road remains impassable.
- Additional rainfall amounts up to 1 inch are possible in the
warned area.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
