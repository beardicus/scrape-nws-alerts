GUSTY SANTA ANA WINDS AND VERY LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR MUCH OF
LOS ANGELES AND VENTURA COUNTIES...
.The first strong Santa Ana wind event of the season is now
ongoing and behaving close to expectations with widespread wind
gusts of 40 to 60 mph through the mountains valleys and some
coasts within the Santa Ana wind cooridor of LA/Ventura Counties
with isolated gusts near 70 mph. Single digit humidities will
prevail during the day with minimal recovery at night. Winds may
drop off a bit into Monday but remain on the strong side. Further
weakening is expected into Tuesday, but may remain strong enough
to support continued critical fire weather conditions (30-50
percent chance) away from the coast across wind prone portions of
Los Angeles and Ventura counties.

Monday.
* Relative Humidity...Minimum humidity each day 5 to 10 percent.

prone areas.

of wildfire that would lead to a threat to life and property.</description>
