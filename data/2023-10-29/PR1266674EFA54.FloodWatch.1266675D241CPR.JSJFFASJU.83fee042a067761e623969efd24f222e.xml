<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Puerto Rico, including the following areas,
Central Interior, Culebra, Eastern Interior, Mayaguez and
Vicinity, North Central, Northeast, Northwest, Ponce and Vicinity,
San Juan and Vicinity, Southeast, Southwest, Vieques and Western
Interior. Portions of Virgin Islands, including the following
areas, St Croix and St.Thomas...St. John...and Adjacent Islands.
* WHEN...Through Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Plenty of tropical moisture and favorable upper-level
conditions will bring periods of showers and thunderstorms
across the local islands through at least Tuesday, although
less widespread than in previous days.
Based on the most recent guidance, scattered to numerous
showers and isolated thunderstorms will continue today
across the forecast area. The areas most likely to
receive the highest rainfall accumulations are the interior,
eastern and southern sections of Puerto Rico as well as the
US Virgin Islands. In these areas, there is the
potential for event-based rainfall totals of 3-6 inches with
higher amounts up to 8 inches through at least Tuesday.
Elsewhere across Puerto Rico, rainfall totals of 3-5 inches
are possible.
There is an elevated risk for flooding of urban areas,roads
and small streams. Life threatening flash flooding and
mudslides are possible as well. Some rivers will likely
overflow their banks. As a result the Flash Flood Watch is in
effect through at least Monday morning.
