* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 538 PM AST, Emergency management reported that recovery
operations are underway following the heavy rain caused by
thunderstorms. While heavy rain is no longer anticipated, the
lingering light to moderate rains might extend the duration
of ongoing minor flooding across the area. Up to 5 inches of
rain have fallen, and additional rainfall amounts of half an
inch is possible. For this reason, the Flash Flood Warning
has downgraded to a Flood Advisory.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
