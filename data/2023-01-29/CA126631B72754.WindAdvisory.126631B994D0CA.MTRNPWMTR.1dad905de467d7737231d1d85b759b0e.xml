* IMPACTS...Gusty winds could blow around unsecured objects.
Tree limbs could be blown down and a few power outages may

sensitive vegetation and possibly damage unprotected outdoor

<instruction>Use extra caution when driving, especially if operating a high
profile vehicle. Secure outdoor objects.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
