<headline>Flood Watch issued January 29 at 3:06AM HST until January 29 at 6:00PM HST by NWS Honolulu</headline>
<description>.Additional rainfall is expected from Oahu to the islands in Maui
and Hawaii Counties through Monday. Already saturated ground will
quickly allow additional runoff to form, increasing the threat for
flooding.
...FLOOD WATCH NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...The Big Island.
* WHEN...Through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Flood prone roads and other low lying areas may be
closed due to elevated runoff and overflowing streams. Urban areas
may receive more significant flooding and property damage due to
rapid runoff.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A surface trough will act as a focus for heavy showers and
thunderstorms over the Big Island through the weekend. The
bulk of the rainfall is expected to fall over windward slopes
and coasts, but some heavy showers could spread to leeward
areas, where stream flow could also become elevated.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action
should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.
A Flood Watch means that conditions are favorable for flash
flooding. Flash Flooding is LIFE THREATENING. Do not cross fast
flowing water in your vehicle or on foot.</instruction>
