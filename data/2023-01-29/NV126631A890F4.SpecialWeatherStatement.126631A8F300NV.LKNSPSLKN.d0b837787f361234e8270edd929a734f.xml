<description>...Snow and blowing snow to continue across portions of northern
Elko county through 4 am this morning...
An area of snow showers will be moving across portions of
northern Elko county through the early morning hours. Radar is
showing an area of light snow from Owyhee south to Tuscarora, east
to Jackpot and HD Summit on US Highway 93. State Route 225 will
also be impacted with snow covered and slippery roads. North to
northwest winds 10 to 15 mph with gusts to 25 mph will promote
blowing and drifting snow, which will hamper visibility and
exacerbate the hazardous driving conditions. Snow accumulations of
an additional inch or so will continue until 4am this morning.
Drivers are encouraged to use caution when driving this morning
due to the snow and slick conditions.
