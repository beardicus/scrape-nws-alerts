<description>...MIXED PRECIPITATION EXPECTED UNTIL MONDAY MORNING FOR THE
MATANUSKA VALLEY...
Precipitation is moving north through Cook Inlet this afternoon.
Mixed precipitation including snow, sleet, and freezing
rain/drizzle is being observed for the Western Kenai Peninsula and
Anchorage. This band will continue north into the Matanuska
Valley. Low confidence exists with regards to precipitation type
as the band moves into cooler, but still slightly drier and warmer
air aloft. Locations that are more likely to see a wintry mix
would be from around Willow south through Big Lake and Wasilla.
Any precipitation that falls as liquid will freeze to surfaces
and roads that are near or below freezing. Temperatures will
continue to be cool enough through the morning to impact the
Monday morning commute. Please plan ahead for slippery road
conditions, slow down, and use caution while traveling.</description>
