<headline>Flood Watch issued January 29 at 9:46AM CST  by NWS Houston - Galveston</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM CST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of southeast Texas, including the following
area, Inland Harris.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM CST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Periods of showers and thunderstorms are expected to continue
throughout the morning and into the late afternoon hours as a
cold front slowly moves through Southeast Texas. 2 to 3
inches of rain has already fallen across the northwestern
portion of Harris County this morning. This area is coming
off of seeing over 5 inches of rain from Tuesday`s storms, so
soil moisture has not had a lot of time to recover which
brings about the potential for flooding.

<instruction>A Flood Watch means there is a potential for flooding based on
current forecasts.
You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
