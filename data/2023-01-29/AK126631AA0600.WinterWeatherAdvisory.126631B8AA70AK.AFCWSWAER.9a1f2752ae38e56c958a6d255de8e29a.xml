<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM AKST MONDAY NORTH
OF ANCHOR POINT THROUGH NIKISKI FOR FREEZING RAIN...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation, including freezing rain expected.
Total snow accumulations of up to one inch and ice accumulations
of up to a tenth of an inch.
* WHERE...Western Kenai Peninsula along the Sterling Highway,
north of Anchor Point through Nikiski.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM AKST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Precipitation is expected to move northward
up Cook Inlet this afternoon through tonight. Surface
temperatures are expected to be around freezing or colder,
allowing any liquid precipitation that reaches the ground to
become frozen. The highest accumulation of ice will be closer to
the Cook Inlet coast. Kenai can expect anywhere from a trace to
0.06 inches of ice accumulation. Localized higher amounts are
possible north of Clam Gulch through Nikiski. Lesser amounts are
expected going further inland from Soldotna east and from
Anchor Point to Clam Gulch where temperatures are expected to be
a little warmer. Temperatures are expected to stay cold
overnight and any ice on the roads and surfaces could remain
through the Monday morning commute.</description>
