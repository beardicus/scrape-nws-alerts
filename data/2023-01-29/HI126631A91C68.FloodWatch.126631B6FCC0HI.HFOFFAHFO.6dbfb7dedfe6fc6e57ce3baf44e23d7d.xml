<headline>Flood Watch issued January 29 at 3:06AM HST until January 29 at 6:00PM HST by NWS Honolulu</headline>
<description>.Additional rainfall is expected from Oahu to the islands in Maui
and Hawaii Counties through Monday. Already saturated ground will
quickly allow additional runoff to form, increasing the threat for
flooding.
...FLOOD WATCH NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Maui, Molokai, Lanai, and Kahoolawe.
* WHEN...Through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Flood prone roads and other low lying areas may be
closed due to elevated runoff and overflowing streams. Urban areas
may receive more significant flooding and property damage due to
rapid runoff. Landslides could lead to road closures, especially
along the Hana Highway.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A surface trough will continue to act as a focus for heavy
showers and thunderstorms over Maui County. Flooding has
already affected some areas in Maui County and any additional
rainfall will quickly flood low lying areas.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action
should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.
A Flood Watch means that conditions are favorable for flash
flooding. Flash Flooding is LIFE THREATENING. Do not cross fast
flowing water in your vehicle or on foot.</instruction>
