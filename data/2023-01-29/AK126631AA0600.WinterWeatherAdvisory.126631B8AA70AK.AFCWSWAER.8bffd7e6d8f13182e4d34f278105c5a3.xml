<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 3 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO
6 AM AKST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected, including freezing rain and
drizzle. Total snow accumulations of up to one inch and ice
accumulations of a light glaze to three hundredths of an inch.
* WHERE...Anchorage.
* WHEN...From 3 PM this afternoon to 6 AM AKST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Precipitation is expected to move northward
up Cook Inlet this afternoon through tonight. Surface
temperatures are expected to be around freezing or colder,
allowing any liquid precipitation that reaches the ground to
become frozen. With dry air in place this morning, the onset of
precipitation and total amounts are less certain. A glaze is
expected across Anchorage, however localized areas could see
further additional ice accumulation to about 0.03 inches.
Temperatures are expected to stay cold overnight and any ice on
the roads and surfaces could remain through the Monday morning
commute.</description>
