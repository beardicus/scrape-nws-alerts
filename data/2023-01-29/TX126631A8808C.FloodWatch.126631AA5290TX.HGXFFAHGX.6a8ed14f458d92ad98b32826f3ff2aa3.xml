<headline>Flood Watch issued January 29 at 3:07AM CST  by NWS Houston - Galveston</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM CST THIS MORNING THROUGH THIS
EVENING...
The National Weather Service in Houston/Galveston has issued a
* Flood Watch for a portion of southeast Texas, including the
following areas, Chambers, Northern Liberty, and Southern
Liberty.
* From 9 AM CST this morning through 6 PM CST this evening
* Periods of showers and thunderstorms are expected in and near
the Watch area through this evening. Rainfall rates up to 2
inches per hour are expected with higher rates possible in the
stronger and slower moving storms. Locations within and around
the Watch area have already received ample rainfall from last
Tuesday and soil moisture has not had a lot of time to recover,
making these areas more prone to flooding.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.</description>
<instruction>A Flood Watch means there is a potential for flooding based on
current forecasts.
You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible
Flood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be
prepared to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
