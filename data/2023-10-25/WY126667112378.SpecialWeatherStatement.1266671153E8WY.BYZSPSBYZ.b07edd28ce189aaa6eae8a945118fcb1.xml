<description>...FREEZING DRIZZLE WILL AFFECT SHERIDAN COUNTY...
At 801 AM MDT, freezing drizzle was being reported in Sheridan
county, including the Sheridan Airport. So far road temperatures
remain above freezing and road conditions are reported as wet, with
ice accumulating on elevated surfaces such as vehicles. However,
over the next few hours roads may become slick as surface
temperatures continue to cool down.
Locations impacted include...
Sheridan, Ranchester, Dayton, Big Horn, Clearmont, Leiter, Arvada,
Parkman, Banner, and Story. This includes portions of I-90 in
Sheridan county.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for roads to be icy in spots.  Please use extreme caution,
especially on bridges, overpasses and around curves. Allow plenty of
stopping distance and avoid braking suddenly. Slow down and allow
extra time when traveling.
If conditions worsen, a Winter Weather Advisory may become
necessary. Please monitor local media outlets and the National
Weather Service for further statements.</description>
