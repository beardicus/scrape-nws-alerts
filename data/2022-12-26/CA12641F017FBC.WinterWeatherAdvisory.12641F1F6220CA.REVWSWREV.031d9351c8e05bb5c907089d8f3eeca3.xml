<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 26 at 2:15PM PST until December 28 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM TUESDAY
TO 10 AM PST WEDNESDAY ABOVE 5500 FEET...
* WHAT...Snow expected above 5500 feet. Total snow accumulations
of 1 to 3 inches, except 3 to 8 inches west of Highway 395 and
up to 15 inches above 7000 feet. Generally 1 inch or less is
expected below 5500 feet. Winds could gust as high as 65 at all
elevations on Tuesday, especially outside of the precipitation.
* WHERE...Lassen-Eastern Plumas-Eastern Sierra Counties.
* WHEN...From 10 AM Tuesday to 10 AM PST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute. Strong
winds could cause extensive tree damage.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Very strong to damaging winds will precede
the winter weather advisory. Furthermore, there is relatively
high uncertainty to snow levels during the main moisture push
Monday afternoon through Tuesday morning. Overall, 2 to 10
inches of heavy/wet snow is possible above 7000 feet before snow
levels fall Tuesday afternoon.</description>
<instruction>Even light snowfall causes major travel delays, especially during
periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to
reach your destination. Leave extra space between vehicles since
it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
