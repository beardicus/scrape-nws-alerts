<headline>High Wind Warning issued December 26 at 2:52PM PST until December 27 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 10 PM THIS EVENING TO
10 AM PST TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Southwest winds 25 to 35 mph with gusts up to 65 mph
expected. Gusts between 110 and 130 mph are possible along
exposed ridges. Waves 4 to 6 feet on Lake Tahoe.
* WHERE...Greater Lake Tahoe Area.
* WHEN...From 10 PM Monday to 10 AM PST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Damaging winds will blow down trees and power lines.
Widespread power outages are expected. Travel will be
difficult, especially for high profile vehicles. Boating
conditions will be extremely dangerous on Lake Tahoe as small
vessels could easily capsize.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow will begin to impact the higher
elevations on Tuesday, especially above 7500 feet. This includes
Mt. Rose Highway. Snow coupled with strong gusty winds may
reduce visibility in the mountains. Snow levels will drop
through the afternoon on Tuesday.</description>
<instruction>Now is the time to secure loose outdoor items such as patio
furniture, holiday decorations, and trash cans before winds
increase which could blow these items away. The best thing to do
is prepare ahead of time by making sure you have extra food and
water on hand, flashlights with spare batteries and/or candles in
the event of a power outage. Move boating or other outdoor
recreation plans to a different day with lighter winds.</instruction>
