<description>...LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS POSSIBLE THIS EVENING THROUGH EARLY TUESDAY
MORNING...
A weak area of low pressure will move across the area this
afternoon with light snow showers possible. Scattered snow showers
should start in the southwestern North Carolina mountains around
sunset and spread further south and east during the evening.
Light accumulations are possible, mainly in the far southwestern
North Carolina mountains, across extreme northeast Georgia, and
portions of the South Carolina mountains. Up to a half-inch of
snow is possible in the aforementioned locations. A few scattered
flurries could develop into portions of the Upper Savannah River
Valley and Upstate South Carolina later on this evening as well.
Most of the snow should taper off overnight tonight.
Those traveling should be prepared for a few isolated slick spots
and lower visibility. Use caution and allow for extra time to
reach your destination. Continue monitoring NOAA Weather Radio and
our website for the latest information, forecasts, and warnings.</description>
