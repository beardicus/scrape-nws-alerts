<description>...MODERATE TO HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BRING RISES ON STREAMS AND RIVERS
THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK...
A strong storm will bring moderate to heavy rainfall beginning
tonight and continuing through Tuesday night.  Two to three inches
of rain is expected over the Cascades and one to 2 inches of rain is
anticipated over the Blue Mountains.  This rainfall, combine with
warmer temperatures will lead to higher snow levels and increased
snow melt and runoff.
As a result, many streams and rivers will experience in-bank rises,
but at this time, no flooding is anticipated.  However, if more
rainfall is received than anticipated or, temperatures are warmer
than expected minor flooding of streams and low lying areas could
occur and there could be ponding of water on some ponding of water
on roadways.
Additional precipitation is anticipated Thursday and Friday, but due
to colder temperatures, no additional flooding concerns are
anticipated, due to the precipitation falling as snow in the
mountains.</description>
