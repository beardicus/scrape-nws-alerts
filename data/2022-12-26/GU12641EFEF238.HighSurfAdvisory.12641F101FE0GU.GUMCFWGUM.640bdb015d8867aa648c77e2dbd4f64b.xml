<headline>High Surf Advisory issued December 26 at 3:42PM ChST until December 28 at 4:00AM ChST by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...INDO-PACIFIC MEN-O-WAR EXPECTED THROUGH LATE TUESDAY NIGHT...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM CHST WEDNESDAY...
...HIGH RISK OF RIP CURRENTS THROUGH LATE TUESDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Large breaking waves of 9 to 11 feet, dangerous rip currents
and Indo-Pacific Men-o-War
* WHERE...For the High Surf Advisory and the High Rip Current Risk,
west and north facing reefs of the Marianas. For the Beach Hazard
Statement, all beaches and surf zone.
* WHEN...Until 4 AM ChST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized
beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water. Contact with Indo-Pacific Men-o-War,
alive or dead, can cause extreme pain and may be fatal in some
cases.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A northwest swell is expected to maintain
hazardous surf and a high rip current risk along west and north
facing reefs of the Marianas. Men-o-War have been reported washed
up on various beaches along west, north and east facing reefs. They
are less likely along south facing beaches but may still be found
in the water.</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.
Remain out of the water to avoid hazardous swimming conditions. Even
if men- o-war are not found along the beach, they could still be out
in the water. Avoid making contact with men-o-war that have washed
up on beaches, especially when bubbles can be seen.</instruction>
