<description>...RISES TO CREEKS, STREAMS, AND RIVERS DUE TO INCREASED
SNOWMELT...
Streams, creeks, and rivers will experience significant rises
moving forward into early next week, especially low and mid
elevation watersheds across the forecast area. Waterways will be
running high, fast, cold, and extremely dangerous increasing the
risk of hypothermia and drowning with even brief periods of time
in the water. Keep a safe distance from these waterways as banks
may become unstable, and especially monitor children and pets
closely as they can quickly drown in these elevated flows.
There is a high chance of localized flooding by early next week
in some mid-elevation watersheds, especially across northern Utah.
Many mid-elevation watersheds are expected to increase to near
bankfull conditions through that time.
High pressure building into the area will lead to a notable
warming trend, allowing temperatures to rise 15 to 20 degrees
above normal by early next week. Given record snowpack in our area
mountains, these temperatures will lead to accelerated snowmelt
of low and mid-elevation basins, leading to the high flows
mentioned above.
Continue to monitor conditions closely as the spring snowmelt-
runoff is now beginning in earnest. Stay tuned for the latest
river forecasts, watches, and warnings. Refer to those already
issued for additional information.</description>
