<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of northeast Minnesota and Wisconsin, including
the following counties, in northeast Minnesota, Cook and Lake. In
Wisconsin, Ashland, Bayfield, Douglas, Iron, Price, Sawyer and
Washburn Counties.
* WHEN...Through Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A band of moderate rain will continue to fall over northwest
Wisconsin into Friday night. An additional 0.3 to 0.6 inches
of rain is expected tonight into early Saturday morning over
this area. Lighter rain, but falling over a still deep
snowpack in the Minnesota Arrowhead, could lead to elevated
flows in waterways in the Arrowhead and North Shore as well
through this weekend. Rain switches over to a wintry mix of
rain and snow in these areas by Saturday and lasts into
Sunday, but could still lead to some runoff into waterways
within the Watch area.
- Flood safety information can be found at
www.weather.gov/safety/flood.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
