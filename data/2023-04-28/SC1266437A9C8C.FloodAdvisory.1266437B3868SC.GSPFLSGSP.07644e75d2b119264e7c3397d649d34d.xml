<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 730 AM EDT THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Nuisance flooding caused by excessive rainfall is ongoing.
* WHERE...Central and southern Spartanburg county and most of
Cherokee County, including the cities of Spartanburg, Gaffney and
Blacksburg.
* WHEN...Until 730 AM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to
drainages and streams, including parks, greenways and trails, golf
courses, boat-access areas, farmland, and woodlands.  Nuisance
flooding of poor-drainage areas, including underpasses and

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 331 AM EDT, Doppler radar indicated between 2.5 and 4.5
inches of rain have fallen since Thursday morning. The rain
has tapered off in the advisory area, but most rivers and
streams are still rising due to runoff. Minor flooding is
ongoing or expected to begin shortly in the advisory area.
Some streams and associated tributaries may exceed
bankfull conditions over the next few hours, including
Lawsons Fork Creek and Fairforest Creek near Spartanburg, and
the North, Middle, and South Tyger rivers near Roebuck,
Reidville, Lyman, and Duncan, flooding adjacent low-lying
areas with shallow inundation.  Additionally, common flood-
prone areas in the Spartanburg metro, including railroad
underpasses, may experience ponding and brief closure.
Lawsons Fork Creek near Lake Forest Drive is rising steadily
and has exceeded the Action/Advisory Stage of 12
feet, as is approaching 14 feet. The creek should crest soon
starting to recede early Friday morning.  Nuisance flooding
of adjacent low-lying woodland areas is expected between US
221 and Goldmine Rd at these levels, as well as the Edwin
Griffin Nature Preserve and The Country Club of Spartanburg.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Spartanburg, Gaffney, Greer, Woodruff, Duncan, Lyman,
Pacolet, Cowpens, Wellford, Blacksburg, Roebuck, Pacolet
Mills, Reidville, Croft State Park, Cedar Springs, USC
Upstate, Moore, GSP Airport, Kings Mountain State Park and
Pauline.
