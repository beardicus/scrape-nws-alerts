<headline>Flood Watch issued April 28 at 1:53AM PDT  by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>.Near record high temperatures through Sunday will bring
significant streamflow rises, especially for snow covered terrain
below about 8000 feet. Rises will likely increase daily through the
weekend following a diurnal melt cycle with the highest flows often
in the evenings and overnight.
...FLOOD WATCH FOR SNOWMELT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by snowmelt continues to be possible.
* WHERE...Portions of California and western Nevada, including the
following areas, in California, Greater Lake Tahoe Area,
Lassen-Eastern Plumas-Eastern Sierra Counties, Mono County and
Surprise Valley California. In western Nevada, Greater Lake Tahoe
Area, Greater Reno-Carson City-Minden Area and Mineral and
Southern Lyon Counties.
* WHEN...Through Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...Creeks and streams will be running high and fast with
minor flooding impacts along several mainstem rivers as well. The
water will be extremely cold, quickly causing shock. Low-water
crossings may be flooded and riverbanks may become unstable.
Nuisance flooding may also occur where drainage systems are
impeded by snow or clogged by other debris.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Minor mainstem flooding is currently forecast along the Forks
of the Carson River beginning Saturday night. Minor flooding
is also forecast to begin below the confluence of the Walker
River (Mason - Snyder Lane) on Monday. Mainstem Carson near
Carson City, West Walker, and Susan River should also be
monitored very closely over the next several days.
