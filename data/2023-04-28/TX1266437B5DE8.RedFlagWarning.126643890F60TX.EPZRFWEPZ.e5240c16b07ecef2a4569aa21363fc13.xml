<headline>Red Flag Warning issued April 28 at 7:26AM CDT until April 28 at 9:00PM CDT by NWS El Paso</headline>
<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING FOR
THE LOWLANDS OF SOUTHWEST AND SOUTH CENTRAL NEW MEXICO, THE LOWER
AND MID ELEVATIONS OF THE GILA, AND EXTREME FAR WEST TEXAS...
.A passing storm system will push through southern New Mexico
today bringing breezy to windy conditions with persisting dry
air over areas west of the Rio Grande Valley. Temperatures will
be seasonably warm for the western areas, but cooler for eastern
areas due to a front moving through this morning. North to
northwest winds will be 20-25 MPH with gusts 30-35 MPH. Strongest
winds will be along and east of the Rio Grande Valley. Minimum RH
will be 7- 12 percent across areas west of the advancing front.
Behind the front, cooler temperatures will help to raise relative
humidity above RFW criteria, but shifting winds will remain
strong. Fire weather conditions will improve through the evening
as winds subside and relative humidity rebounds above critical
levels.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO 8 PM MDT
THIS EVENING FOR FOR STRONG WINDS AND DRY CONDITIONS...
* WIND...Northwest winds at 20 to 25 MPH and gusts 30 to 35 MPH.
* HUMIDITY...Minimum relative humidity 7 to 15 percent. 16 to 25
percent for areas along and east of the Rio Grande Valley.
* COLD FRONT AND WIND SHIFTS...An initial cold front will push
into the region from the South Plains this morning. Winds will
turn northerly and northeasterly this morning across the
Sacramento mountains, and the lowlands east of the Rio Grande. A
secondary push will occur around mid day today brining stronger
northeast to east winds in these areas. This second push will
continue west into the afternoon hours.
* IMPACTS...any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly.
Outdoor burning is not recommended. Operational impacts due
to abrupt wind shifts should be considered due to the
approaching and passing cold front.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now, or will shortly. A combination of
strong winds, low relative humidity, and warm temperatures can
contribute to extreme fire behavior.</instruction>
