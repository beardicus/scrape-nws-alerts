<headline>High Surf Warning issued January 14 at 4:24AM ChST until January 14 at 6:00PM ChST by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM CHST THIS EVENING ALONG
NORTH FACING REEFS...
...HIGH RISK OF RIP CURRENTS THROUGH SUNDAY AFTERNOON ALONG
NORTH AND EAST FACING REEFS...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM THIS EVENING TO 6 PM
CHST SUNDAY ALONG NORTH AND EAST FACING REEFS...
* WHAT...Dangerously large breaking waves of 11 to 15 feet and
dangerous rip currents expected along north and east facing
reefs.
* WHERE...Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Warning, until 6 PM ChST Saturday.
For the High Surf Advisory, from 6 PM Saturday to 6 PM ChST
Sunday. For the High Rip Current Risk, through Sunday
afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Breaking waves can sweep people off jetties and
docks, and into dangerous seas. Life-threatening swimming
conditions and significant beach erosion can be expected. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Ritidian buoy measured 11 to 15 feet
today and model projections expect a similar trend tomorrow as
well. Swell is expected to turn more from the east and
gradually subside Saturday afternoon into evening, downgrading
to an advisory and be extended to east-facing reefs when the
warning expires.</description>
<instruction>Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other waterside
infrastructure.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
