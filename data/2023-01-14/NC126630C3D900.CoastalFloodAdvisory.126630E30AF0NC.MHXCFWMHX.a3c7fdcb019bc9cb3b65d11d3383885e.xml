<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM THIS EVENING TO
10 AM EST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Up to 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level
expected in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...Areas along the beaches, Albemarle, Croatan, Roanoke,

* WHEN...From 7 PM this evening to 10 AM EST Monday. Minor
soundside flooding will be possible first, starting tonight,
with the potential for minor flooding shifting to oceanside
locations Sunday night due to long period swell arriving from a
coastal storm offshore.
* IMPACTS...Up to 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in a low threat of property damage. Some roads and low
