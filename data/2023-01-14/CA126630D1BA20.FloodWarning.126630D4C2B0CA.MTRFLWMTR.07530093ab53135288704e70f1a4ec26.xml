rainfall and runoff continues.

for all the water from these storms to work through local drainage
systems in urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...

indicated heavy rain due to thunderstorms. Flooding is
ongoing or expected to begin shortly in the warned area.

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
