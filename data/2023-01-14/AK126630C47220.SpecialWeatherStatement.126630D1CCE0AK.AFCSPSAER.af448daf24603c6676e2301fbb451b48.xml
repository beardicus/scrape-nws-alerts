<description>...A WINTRY MIX OF SNOW, FREEZING RAIN, AND RAIN LIKELY THROUGH
SUNDAY MORNING...
A frontal system will bring snow to areas of the eastern Kenai
Peninsula along the Seward Highway this morning, with several
inches of snow possible along the highway from Portage Valley to
Turnagain Pass. Warmer air aloft will move overhead throughout the
day today, allowing for snow levels to climb to between 800 and
1200 ft by Saturday afternoon. The warmer air will allow snow to
changeover to rain, first for Seward and Whittier, then for
Portage Valley and portions of the Seward Highway that typically
experience warmer temperatures. Snow or mixed rain/snow is
expected to linger from Summit Lake to Turnagain Pass through
Saturday evening. A brief period of freezing rain is possible
through Portage Valley late Saturday morning or early Saturday
afternoon as the warmer air arrives, but prior to the development
of southeasterly surface winds. Once these winds increase, warmer
air at the surface should allow for a transition to all rain.
Rain on top of cold roadway surfaces may lead to icy conditions
and hazardous travel conditions. Rain may also lead to water
ponding on area roadways. Motorists are urged to slow down and use
caution when traveling.
