<headline>Flood Warning issued January 14 at 2:05PM PST until further notice by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM PST THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Urban area and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall continues.
* WHERE...A portion of northern California, including the following
counties, Marin, Napa and Sonoma.
* WHEN...Until 500 PM PST.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring. Streams
continue to rise due to excess runoff from earlier rainfall.
Low-water crossings may be inundated with water and may not be
passable. It will take several hours for all the water from these
storms to work through local drainage systems in urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 202 PM PST, Doppler radar and automated stream gauges
indicate flooding is already occurring and periods of
moderate rain continues in the warned area.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Santa Rosa, Petaluma, Novato, Rohnert Park, Windsor,
Healdsburg, Sonoma, Cloverdale, Sebastopol, Cotati,
Larkfield-Wikiup, Roseland, South Santa Rosa Cdp, Boyes Hot
Springs, Black Point-Green Point, Forestville, Guerneville,
Graton, Occidental and Monte Rio.

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
