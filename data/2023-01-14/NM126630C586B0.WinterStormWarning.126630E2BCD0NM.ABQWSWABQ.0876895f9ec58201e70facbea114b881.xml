* WHERE...Southwest Mountains.
* WHEN...From Midnight tonight to 6 AM MST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will
likely become slick and hazardous. Visibilities may drop below 1/4
mile due to falling and blowing snow. Travel could be very
difficult. Tire chains may be necessary if traveling through
mountain passes. Strong winds could cause extensive damage to
trees and power lines.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency. For the latest road

Persons should delay all travel if possible. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution and be prepared for sudden
changes in visibility. Leave plenty of room between you and the
motorist ahead of you, and allow extra time to reach your
destination. Avoid sudden braking or acceleration, and be especially
cautious on hills or when making turns. Make sure your car is
winterized and in good working order.</instruction>
