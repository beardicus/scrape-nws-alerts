<description>...Forecast flooding changed from Minor to Major severity and
increased in duration for the following rivers in Minnesota...
Red Lake River at Crookston affecting Polk County.
.An ice jam is likely affecting the river levels on Red Lake River
at Crookston MN. An additional increase into major flood stage is
possible as ice moves through the area. Fluctuations of several feet
are possible. Uncertainty exists of rate of rise and fall as ice
moves through, in addition to river levels into mid to late this
week due to forecast chance for precipitation and cooler than
average temperatures.
Historic ice jam crests are as follows..
24 feet in 2010.
20.8 feet in 2011.
22.4 feet in 2013.
21.3 feet in 2014.
