<headline>Flood Warning issued April 17 at 12:18PM CDT until further notice by NWS Bismarck</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING FOR SNOWMELT NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM CDT TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by snowmelt will continue.
* WHERE...Portions of north central North Dakota and the James River
Valley.
* WHEN...Until 100 PM CDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring. Numerous roads
remain closed due to flooding.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1216 PM CDT, Snowpack has been soaking into the ground and
the upper portions of soils are becoming saturated. Areas
that have appreciable snowpack remaining will see additional
runoff in the coming days as the ponding water eventually
makes its way through frozen culverts and into the waterways.
In the Prairie pothole region, ponds and sloughs may see
water rise enough to run over roads. Throughout the warned
area, county and township roads may become covered in water
due to high water and plugged culverts. Mainly rural areas
will be affected, but towns and cities may also experience
localized flooding issues.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
