<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued April 17 at 12:58AM CDT until April 17 at 10:00AM CDT by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Heavy Snow Band Continuing From Western Into Central Wisconsin...
.The heaviest band of snow so far formed overnight, from north-
central Wisconsin into parts of western Wisconsin, or roughly from
Taylor County south into portions of La Crosse and Monroe
Counties. Estimated snowfall rates are nearing 2 inches per hour
with visibilities less than a mile being reported. Webcams are
showing rapid accumulations occurring, with roads becoming snow
covered rapidly after being plowed. In addition, the heavy, wet
snow combined with gusty winds could cause some power outages and
tree damage to occur. This heaviest band expected to remain over
north-central Wisconsin into the morning hours.
Snow reports from Sunday have been highly variable with a wide
range. Amounts of a couple of inches have been common for parts of
southeast Minnesota to as much as 10 inches across parts of
western Wisconsin. As more snow falls overnight, storm totals
could be a foot or more for portions of western Wisconsin. Travel
tonight into Monday morning is expected to be impacted with a
slower than normal morning commute possible.

MORNING...
* WHAT...Snow. Additional snow accumulations of up to two
inches. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.
