late this afternoon into the evening. Precipitation will likely
start off as freezing rain and sleet, and then transition over to

four inches of snow is also possible across these area, and a
Winter Storm Warning is in effect for the combined impacts of ice
and snow. Lesser snow and ice totals to the northwest and
southwest of this swath will still cause minor travel impacts,
where a Winter Weather Advisory is in effect.
