<description>...PATCHY DENSE FOG EARLY THIS MORNING...
Patchy to areas of fog will continue to develop across parts of
south coastal South Carolina and into the Savannah Metro Area this
morning. The fog could become locally dense at time with
visibilities dropping to 1/4 mile or less, mainly near the coast
and up along Charleston Harbor, the Broad River and the Savannah
River. The nature of the fog is such that visibilities will vary
greatly over short distances with the risk for locally dense fog
being the greatest near bodies of water and other low- lying areas
such as marshes, swamps and large ditches. Motorists should
remain alert for these conditions this morning.
Some locations that could see locally dense fog include Isle of
Palms, Mount Pleasant, Downtown Charleston, Daniel Island, Johns
Island, Edisto Island, Beaufort, Hilton Head, Tybee Island,
Wilmington Island, Skidaway Island and parts of the Savannah Metro
Area.</description>
