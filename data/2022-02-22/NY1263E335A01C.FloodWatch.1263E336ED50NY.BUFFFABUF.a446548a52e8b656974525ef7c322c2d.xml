<headline>Flood Watch issued February 22 at 7:47PM EST until February 23 at 4:00AM EST by NWS Buffalo</headline>
<description>.Flows on area creeks and rivers are already running high from
recent rainfall. Additional rainfall and snow melt through tonight
will cause flows to increase and may result in flooding.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH WEDNESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of western New York, including the following
counties, Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Genesee, Livingston,
Monroe, Niagara, Northern Erie, Orleans, Southern Erie and Wyoming.
* WHEN...Through Wednesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Flows are already high on many area creeks and rivers,
and the combination of snow melt from warm weather and rainfall
through tonight will cause water levels to rise again. This will
bring the risk of flooding along some rivers and creeks due to
high flows.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Between a half inch and an inch of rain is expected through
tonight. This combined with warm weather will result in snow
melt, with a primed snow pack in place across the headwaters
for most creeks and rivers in the watch area. This will
result in rises on larger creeks and rivers, and potentially
will cause flooding at some flood prone areas.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
