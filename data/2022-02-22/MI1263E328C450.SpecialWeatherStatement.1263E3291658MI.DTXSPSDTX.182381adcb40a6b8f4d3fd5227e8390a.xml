<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT...
WEATHER...
* Temperatures will continue to hover around the freezing mark
into the early afternoon hours as precipitation continues to
occur over Midland and Bay counties. Much of this precipitation
will fall in the form of freezing rain.
* Freezing rain rates up to 0.02 inch per hour will be possible,
with light icing accumulation possible especially in interior
portions of Midland and Bay counties where temperatures are
most likely to remain just below freezing.
*  In addition to the potential for freezing rain, areas of fog
will be possible into the early afternoon hours, locally dense
at times. Visibility may be restricted below 1/2 mile at times.
IMPACTS...
* Light icing will lead to hazardous conditions on untreated
roads and walking surfaces.
&amp;&amp;
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
* Motorists are urged to use caution and account for hazardous
driving conditions by slowing down and allowing extra time.
* Motorists should also take into account extra travel times and
use low beam headlights due to low visibility in areas of fog.
* Prepare, plan and stay informed. Visit http://go.usa.gov/c7kkP</description>
