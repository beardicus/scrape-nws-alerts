<senderName>NWS El Paso (Southern New Mexico and extreme Western Texas)</senderName>
<headline>Red Flag Warning issued February 22 at 11:50PM CST until February 23 at 8:00PM CST by NWS El Paso</headline>
<description>...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...
.Strong southwest flow ahead of an approaching winter storm to
the north will promote windy conditions across southern New
Mexico and far west Texas Wednesday afternoon. These winds
combined with very dry air and favorable fuel conditions will
promote high fire danger. Fire will spread quickly in areas with
high grass or brush concentrations, with the worst conditions
along the Rio Grande Valley mid-afternoon. Higher moisture and
cooler temperatures will lessen fire threats over the high
mountain terrain.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON TO 7 PM MST
WEDNESDAY FOR STRONG WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR FIRE
WEATHER ZONES 055, 111, AND 112...
* AFFECTED AREA...Fire weather zones 111 and 112 in southwest and
south-central New Mexico. Fire weather zone 055 in far west
Texas.
* WIND...Southwest winds 30 to 40 mph with gusts up to 50 mph.
* HUMIDITY...8 to 15 percent
* HIGHEST THREAT...is located along the Rio Grande Valley
across Sierra, Dona Ana, and Luna Counties.
* IMPACTS...Any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly.
Outdoor burning is not recommended.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now, or will shortly. A combination of
strong winds, low relative humidity, and warm temperatures can
contribute to extreme fire behavior.</instruction>
