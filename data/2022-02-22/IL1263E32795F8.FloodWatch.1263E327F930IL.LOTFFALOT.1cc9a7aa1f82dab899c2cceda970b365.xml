<headline>Flood Watch issued February 22 at 2:46AM CST  by NWS Chicago</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST TODAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by heavy rain showers on frozen ground and
due to river ice is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Illinois and northwest Indiana, including the
following areas, in Illinois, Boone, Cook, De Kalb, DuPage,
Grundy, Kane, Kendall, La Salle, Lake IL, Lee, McHenry, Ogle, Will
and Winnebago Counties. In northwest Indiana, Lake IN and Porter
Counties.
* WHEN...Until Noon CST today.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of some rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Heavy river
ice cover may break up and lead to localized ice jams.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Showers and thunderstorms will move over northern Illinois
and northwest Indiana this morning. Rainfall rates up to one
half inch per hour are possible, with isolated thunderstorms
possibly producing rain rates up to one inch per hour. Soil
frost depths of 8 to near 20 inches, with the deepest frozen
soils near the Wisconsin state line. Frozen soil may limit
infiltration and increase how much rainfall becomes runoff
headed toward streams and rivers. Heavy river ice cover also
remains in place along stretches of the Rock River, Fox
River, and their tributaries. River rises may break up ice
cover and cause localized ice jams.
