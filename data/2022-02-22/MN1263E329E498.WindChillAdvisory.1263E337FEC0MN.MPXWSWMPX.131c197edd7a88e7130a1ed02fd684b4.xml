air will settle in behind the storm system overnight. Wind chills
of 25 to 35 below zero are forecast tonight as the cold air moves
in. The best chance for the colder part of this range will be
over western Minnesota where the winds will remain higher.

WEDNESDAY...

* WHERE...Yellow Medicine County.
* WHEN...For the Winter Weather Advisory, until 9 PM CST this
evening. For the Wind Chill Advisory, until 10 AM CST
