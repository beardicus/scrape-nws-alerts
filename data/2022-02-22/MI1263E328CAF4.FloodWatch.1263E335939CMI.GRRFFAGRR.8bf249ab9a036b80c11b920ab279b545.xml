<headline>Flood Watch issued February 22 at 11:37AM EST  by NWS Grand Rapids</headline>
<description>.An ice jam may cause water to infiltrate the lowlands along the
Grand River.
...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH WEDNESDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by ice jams continues to be possible.
* WHERE...A portion of southwest Michigan, including the following
county, Ottawa.
* WHEN...Through Wednesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Localized flooding of low lying areas and property along
the Grand River will be possible. Rapid water level fluctuations
may occur due to heavy ice cover on the river and possible ice jam
formation.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- As of Monday morning, a significant ice jam that had formed
on the river near the highway 231 bridge, has moved
downstream to near the Connor Bayou area, and is causing
flooding in parts of Robinson Township. As this ice jam
slowly moves downriver over the next few days, additional
flooding is possible, including at some areas along the river
that typically don`t have flooding problems.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
