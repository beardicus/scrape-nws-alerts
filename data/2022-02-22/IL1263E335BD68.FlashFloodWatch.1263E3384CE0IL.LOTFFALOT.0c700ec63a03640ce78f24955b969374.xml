River.
* WHEN...Through Wednesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Localized flooding of low lying areas and property along
the river may occur upstream and downstream of the ice jam. Rapid
water level fluctuations may occur due to heavy ice cover on the
river.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...

break up and is pushing into the Illinois River. If the ice
jam were to break up quickly, flash flooding could occur,
primarily downstream of the Will/Grundy county line and to
the Illinois River.
