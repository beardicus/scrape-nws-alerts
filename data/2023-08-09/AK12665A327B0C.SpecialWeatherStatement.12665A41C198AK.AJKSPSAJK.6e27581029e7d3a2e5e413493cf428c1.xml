<description>...A Strong Storm Moves Through the Panhandle This Weekend...
A gale force low with a significant source of subtropical
moisture will enter the Gulf of Alaska Saturday. This system will
bring moderate to heavy rain and windy conditions to the Panhandle
Saturday and Sunday. Heaviest rainfall is expected through
Saturday afternoon with the central inner channels and southern
Panhandle seeing the greatest accumulations. For those along the
Mendenhall River, the rainy and windy conditions could increase
the risk of trees falling into and around the river from the
already unstable river banks.
Current best estimates suggest that there is a greater than 70
percent chance that the southern Panhandle could see at least 3
inches of rainfall over 48 hours. For the northern and central
gulf coast and central inner channels, there is around a 50
percent chance of at least 2 inches of rain could fall over 48
hours.
Winds will increase through Saturday before diminishing Sunday.
Strongest winds are expected Saturday afternoon through Saturday
evening. 30 to 40 kt marine winds are expected to arrive to outer
coast by late Saturday morning. Through the inner channels, first
estimates suggest marine winds between 20 to 30 kts are likely
through Saturday afternoon. For central and southern Panhandle
communities, wind gusts to 35 mph are likely.</description>
