<description>...A strong thunderstorm will impact portions of central Hall County
through 645 PM CDT...
At 615 PM, storm spotters sighted a possible cold air funnel north
of Wood River in Hall County. Cold air funnels are not associated
with strong thunderstorms but are usually reported within or near
showers or very weak thunderstorms. Cold air funnels form as the
updraft of a shower or very weak thunderstorm stretches very small
pre-existing areas of rotation into funnels, similar to a landspout.
Cold air funnels usually last for only a short period of time and
normally do not come in contact with the ground. They typically pose
no threat to public safety. If they do touch down, it is usually for
a very brief period and the damage is relatively minor.
Locations impacted include...
Wood River and Alda.
This includes Interstate 80 between mile markers 302 and 311.
