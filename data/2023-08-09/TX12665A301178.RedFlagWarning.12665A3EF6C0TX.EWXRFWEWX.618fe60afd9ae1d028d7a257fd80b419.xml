<headline>Red Flag Warning issued August 09 at 1:38AM CDT until August 09 at 11:00PM CDT by NWS Austin-San Antonio</headline>
<description>...Increased Fire Danger Continues Across South Central Texas...
.A combination of critically to extremely dry fuels, breezy
winds, and low afternoon humidity continue to support wildfires
with high resistance to control, per guidance from the Texas A&amp;M
Forest Service. It is also being observed that in this very hot
air mass relatively light prevailing winds are routinely gusting
to more than double the value of the sustained speeds, reaching
between 25 and 35 MPH in the late afternoon and early evening
hours. Based on these observed conditions and impacts, a Red Flag
Warning is in effect from noon until 11 PM today. Elevated to near
critical fire weather conditions are expected for the remainder
of South Central Texas, namely portions of the Coastal Plains,
where a Fire Danger Statement will be in effect.
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO 11 PM CDT THIS
EVENING FOR WIND AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR MUCH OF
SOUTH CENTRAL TEXAS...
The National Weather Service in Austin/San Antonio has issued a
Red Flag Warning for wind and low relative humidity, which is in
effect from noon today to 11 PM CDT this evening.
* WINDS...South 10 to 20 mph with gusts up to 35 mph.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...As low as 22 percent.
* IMPACTS...Any fires that develop can spread rapidly and
exhibit high resistance to control. Any outdoor activity that
could produce flames or sparks is discouraged.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now....or will shortly. A combination of
strong winds...low relative humidity...and warm temperatures can
contribute to extreme fire behavior.</instruction>
