<description>...AIR QUALITY HEALTH ADVISORY FOR WILDFIRE SMOKE FROM 900 AM
WEDNESDAY UNTIL 900 AM THURSDAY...
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has
issued the following...
WHAT...Air Quality Health Advisory for Wildfire Smoke.
WHERE...Archuleta and southern parts of Mineral and Hinsdale
Counties. Locations include, but are not limited to, Piedra and
Arboles.
WHEN...900 AM Wednesday August 09 to 900 AM Thursday August 10
IMPACTS...The Bear Creek, Dry Lake, and Quartz Ridge wildfires
will produce moderate to heavy smoke Wednesday morning for parts
of Archuleta and southern portions of Mineral and Hinsdale
Counties. This smoke will decrease by late Wednesday morning as
atmospheric mixing increases. By Wednesday afternoon, westerly
winds will transport smoke east of the fires. Most of that smoke
will remain aloft and well above ground level, however brief
periods of moderate to heavy smoke will be possible in parts of
the San Luis Valley. By late Wednesday night, moderate to heavy
smoke from the Bear Creek and Dry Lake fires will drain from
Weminuche Creek in southern Hinsdale County southward into the
Piedra area, and could continue down the Piedra River as far south
as Arboles by early Thursday morning. Additionally, the Quartz
Ridge wildfire in eastern Archuleta County could produce moderate
to heavy smoke overnight for locations along East Fork Road
westward to Highway 160 north of Pagosa Springs.
HEALTH INFORMATION...Public Health Recommendations: If smoke is
thick or becomes thick in your neighborhood you may want to remain
indoors. This is especially true for those with heart disease,
respiratory illnesses, the very young, and the elderly. Consider
limiting outdoor activity when moderate to heavy smoke is present.
Consider relocating temporarily if smoke is present indoors and is
making you ill. If visibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in
your neighborhood, smoke has reached levels that are unhealthy.</description>
