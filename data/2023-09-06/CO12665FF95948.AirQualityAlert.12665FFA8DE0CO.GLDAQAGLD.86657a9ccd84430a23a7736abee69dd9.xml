<description>...AIR QUALITY HEALTH ADVISORY FOR WILDFIRE SMOKE FROM 700 AM
WEDNESDAY UNTIL 400 PM WEDNESDAY...
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has
issued the following...
WHAT...Air Quality Health Advisory for Wildfire Smoke.
WHERE...Sedgwick, Logan, Phillips, Yuma, Washington, Kit Carson,
Lincoln, Cheyenne, Kiowa, Bent, Prowers, Baca and Morgan Counties.
Locations include, but are not limited to Julesburg, Sterling,
Holyoke, Wray, Akron, Burlington, Limon, Cheyenne Wells, Eads, Las
Animas, Lamar, Springfield and Fort Morgan.
WHEN...700 AM Wednesday September 06 to 400 PM Wednesday September
06
IMPACTS...Smoke from large wildfires burning in upwind states and
Canada is being transported into Colorado, resulting in heavy
smoke across eastern portions of the state. Moderate to heavy
smoke is possible on Wednesday throughout the advisory area. Smoke
should decrease Wednesday afternoon as shifting winds and
atmospheric mixing decrease smoke concentrations.
HEALTH INFORMATION...Public Health Recommendations: If smoke is
thick or becomes thick in your neighborhood you may want to remain
indoors. This is especially true for those with heart disease,
respiratory illnesses, the very young, and the elderly. Consider
limiting outdoor activity when moderate to heavy smoke is present.
Consider relocating temporarily if smoke is present indoors and is
making you ill. If visibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in
your neighborhood, smoke has reached levels that are unhealthy.</description>
