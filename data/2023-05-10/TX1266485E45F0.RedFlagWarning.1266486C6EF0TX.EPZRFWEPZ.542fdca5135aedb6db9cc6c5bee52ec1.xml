<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FOR WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING
FOR SOUTHWEST AND SOUTH CENTRAL NEW MEXICO AND FAR WEST TEXAS...
.The region continues in an extended period of warm and dry
conditions, as deep southwest flow delivers breezy afternoons. As
such, fuels are continuing to dry. On Wednesday, a Pacific low
will eject across the Four Corners Region, tightening pressure
gradients and inducing surface troughing. This will increase wind
speeds across the area on Wednesday. A windy afternoon and
evening will elevate fire weather conditions to critical. The
probability for new wildfire starts and large growth of any
existing fires will be increased. Winds will decrease for the end
of the week, but RH`s will remain low. Relief is possible by
Saturday as moisture looks to move in from the east to raise
relative humditiy, and bring scattered rain showers.
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO 9 PM MDT THIS
EVENING FOR STRONG WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR FIRE
WEATHER ZONE 055...
The National Weather Service in El Paso Tx/Santa Teresa has
issued a Red Flag Warning, which is in effect from noon today to
9 PM MDT this evening.
* AFFECTED AREA...TEXAS FIRE WEATHER ZONE 055.

mph.

<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now, or will shortly. A combination of
strong winds, low relative humidity, and warm temperatures can
contribute to extreme fire behavior.</instruction>
