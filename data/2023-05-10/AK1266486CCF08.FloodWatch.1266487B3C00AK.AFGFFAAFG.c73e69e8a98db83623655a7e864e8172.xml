<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY
ALONG THE YUKON RIVER AT EAGLE...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam is possible.
* WHERE...Yukon River at Eagle.
* WHEN...From Thursday afternoon through Sunday.
* IMPACTS...The Yukon River may rise above the natural riverbank.
Ice jam flooding has high uncertainty. Impacts could range between
localized high water and severe flooding. Now is the time to take
precautions. Where possible, move items to higher ground and prepare
your community for possible flooding.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Water levels have risen approximately 7 feet since Monday at
Eagle and are continuing to steadily increase at Eagle. The
Yukon at Dawson broke up on Tuesday afternoon and a large ice
jam formed down river Tuesday evening. This jam was holding
on Wednesday, with downstream to approximately 10 miles
upriver from the Fortymile confluence. The Yukon River is
expected to breakup in Eagle between Thursday afternoon and
Sunday. Intact ice is in place in front of Eagle. Breakup
above Eagle has been dynamic with ice jams forming and
releasing, this is expected to continue down river past
Eagle.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor local river conditions and prepare for the
possibility of ice jam flooding. Those living in areas prone to
flooding should be prepared to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
