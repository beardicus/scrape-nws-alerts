<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING NOW IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO 3
PM MST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations up to 3
inches on the plains, with between 5 and 10 inches at and above
pass level. Winds gusting as high as 65 mph.
* WHERE...East Glacier Park Region.
* WHEN...From 2 PM this afternoon to 3 PM MST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Whiteout conditions are expected and will make travel
treacherous and potentially life-threatening. Travel could be very
difficult to impossible and tire chains may be required for some
vehicles. Those in the backcountry should ensure they have
appropriate knowledge and gear and may want to consider alternate
plans. Widespread blowing snow could significantly reduce
visibility.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road conditions can
be obtained by calling 5 1 1 or visiting the MDT Road Report website.
Persons should delay all travel if possible. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution and be prepared for sudden
changes in visibility. Leave plenty of room between you and the
motorist ahead of you, and allow extra time to reach your
destination. Avoid sudden braking or acceleration, and be especially
cautious on hills or when making turns. Make sure your car is
winterized and in good working order.
