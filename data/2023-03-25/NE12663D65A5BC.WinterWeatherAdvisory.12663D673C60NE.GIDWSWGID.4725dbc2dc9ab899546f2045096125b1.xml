<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued March 25 at 10:59PM CDT until March 26 at 9:00AM CDT by NWS Hastings</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM CDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Wet, slushy snow expected. A fairly narrow band of snow
will continue developing northward and eastward overnight, while
gradually ending from west to east. Snow amounts in Nance,
Sherman and Howard counties will likely vary from less than one-
half inch up to at least 2 inches, with localized slightly
higher amounts possible especially in southern Howard County.
Winds will not be overly-strong, with sustained speeds mainly 10
to 20 MPH and gusts to around 25 MPH, mainly from the north.
* WHERE...Nance, Sherman and Howard Counties.
* WHEN...Until 9 AM CDT Sunday, although most areas will likely
see snow end by 7 AM.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions anywhere that
slushy snow accumulates on roads and sidewalks.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Due to the main snow band likely being no
more than 30 miles in width, it must be emphasized that snow
amounts will vary considerably across the Advisory area. While
many places will receive 1 inch or less, isolated pockets of at
least 2 inches inches are possible within the heart of the main
band.</description>
