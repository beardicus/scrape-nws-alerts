<description>...MIXED WINTERY PRECIPITATION WILL CONTINUE TODAY WITH MORNING
DENSE FOG...
Showers are continuing this morning and with temperatures hovering
right around freezing, we are seeing a mix of wintery
precipitation. Throughout the greater Portland and Vancouver
Metro area, central Willamette Valley and the lower Columbia area
along I-5 will see periods of snow, rain/snow mix, snow grains
and even some small hail. While more of a wet snow, spotty
accumulations of up to 1 inch are possible, especially along the
sides of roads and grassy surfaces. Elevations above 500 ft are
most likely to see acccumulating snow. As temperatures warm
through the day, snow will become less likely, though periods of
mixed rain and snow are still possible. For current road
conditions visit www.tripcheck.org or dial 5-1-1.
In addition to this winter precipitation, dense fog is forming in
areas which is leading to reduced visibility to one quarter mile
or less. This fog is not necessarily widespread but may come up
suddenly. Be alert if traveling, wear reflective clothing, and
leave ample space between you and vehicles around you.</description>
