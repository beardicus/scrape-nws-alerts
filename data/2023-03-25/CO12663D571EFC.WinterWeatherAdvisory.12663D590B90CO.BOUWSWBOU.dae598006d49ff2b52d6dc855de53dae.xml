<description>...AREAS OF HEAVY SNOW ON THE NORTHEAST PLAINS...
.An area of snow will move across northeastern Colorado today, with
the snow lingering into tonight in the northeast corner. The
heaviest snow this morning will move from Weld county across Morgan
county. For this afternoon and evening, it will shift to Sterling
and Akron and areas further east and northeast.  The snow will be
heavy at times and will produce snow covered roads and limited
visibilities. In areas west of Sterling and Akron, conditions should
improve this afternoon. Further east there may be some help with
highways from warm temperatures this afternoon, but icy and snow
covered roads will be likely this evening.

gusting as high as 50 mph.

visibility in the heavier showers.</description>
