<description>...At Least Minor Accumulation Of Wet, Slushy Snow Likely This
Evening-Overnight In Counties Along The Nebraska-Kansas Border...
Although the primary, west-to-east oriented band of potentially
heavier snow is expected to focus just north of this area this
evening and overnight, at least minor snow accumulation ranging
from a dusting to perhaps more than 1 inch is possible. For those
areas that do receive snow, it will be of the wet/slushy variety,
and could accumulate on roads if it falls heavily enough.
Given that the main snow band is currently expected to remain
just north of this area, there is not a formal Winter Weather
Advisory in effect at this time. However, trends will be closely
monitored tonight, just in case the main snow band sets up
slightly farther south than currently expected.</description>
