* WHEN...Through Thursday evening.
* IMPACTS...Heavy rainfall could trigger flash flooding of low-lying
areas and debris flows in and near recent burn scars. Residents

should prepare for potential flooding impacts. Other locations

flash flooding. Be ready to act and move to higher ground
immediately should a Flash Flood Warning be issued for your area.
