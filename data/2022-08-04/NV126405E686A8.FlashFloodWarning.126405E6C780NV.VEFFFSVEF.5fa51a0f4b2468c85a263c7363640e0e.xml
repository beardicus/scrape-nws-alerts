At 734 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicates that over the past hour

However, between 0.5 and 1 inch of rain has fallen and runoff from
the storms will still be capable of producing flash flooding in the
warned area.
HAZARD...Life-threatening flash flooding.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Life-threatening flash flooding of low-water crossings,
creeks, normally dry washes and roads.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Panaca and Cathedral Gorge State Park.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
