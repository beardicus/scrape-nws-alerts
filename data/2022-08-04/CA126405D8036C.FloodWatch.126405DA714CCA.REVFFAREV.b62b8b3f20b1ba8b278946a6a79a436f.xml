develop again on Thursday and Friday. The additional heavy rain on
top of what has already fallen this week will continue the threat of
flash flooding, particularly near burn scars, small creeks, and
steep terrain.

FROM LATE THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.

County. In western Nevada, Mineral and Southern Lyon Counties.
This includes the Slink, Mountain View, and Boot burn scars.

through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...Heavy rainfall could trigger flash flooding of low-lying
areas and debris flows in and near recent burn scars. Residents
