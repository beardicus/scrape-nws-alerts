<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to rising rivers, streams, or creeks as river
levels often peak overnight. Please heed local advisories and
closures.</instruction>
