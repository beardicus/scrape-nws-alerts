<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM WEDNESDAY TO 6 AM CST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 4 to 7
inches. Winds could gust as high as 55 mph. Blizzard conditions
will also be possible, with extreme cold wind chills as well.
Wind chills as low as 30 to 40 below will be possible, especially
starting midday Thursday.
* WHERE...Portions of northwest Illinois and east central,
northeast and southeast Iowa.
* WHEN...From 6 PM Wednesday to 6 AM CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute. Gusty
winds could bring down tree branches. The dangerously cold
wind chills as low as 35 below zero could cause frostbite on
exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Uncertainty remains on snowfall totals, but
impacts from the combined effects of the wind and snow are
expected. Thus, blizzard conditions will be possible. This will
also lead to difficulty when gathering accurate measurements of
snow during the event. This will be a long duration event, so
plan appropriately prior to the start. Plan travel around peak
hours of the storm, either before or after impacts.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
The latest road conditions for the state you are calling from can
be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
