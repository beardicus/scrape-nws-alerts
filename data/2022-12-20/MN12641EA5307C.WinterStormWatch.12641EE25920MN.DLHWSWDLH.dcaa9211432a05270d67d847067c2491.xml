<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING...
...WIND CHILL ADVISORY HAS EXPIRED...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions possible. Total snow accumulations
of 3 to 5 inches possible. Winds could gust as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...South Cass, Crow Wing and South Aitkin Counties. This
includes the Tribal Lands of the Mille Lacs Band, East Lake
area.
* WHEN...From Wednesday afternoon through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous

dangerously cold wind chills as low as 40 below zero could
cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A new Wind Chill Advisory will likely be
needed tonight as wind chills drop as low as 35 below zero. Snow
loading on trees from the past storm in combination with the
high winds may cause heavy tree damage resulting in widespread
power outages in cold weather. Blizzard conditions are possible.</description>
