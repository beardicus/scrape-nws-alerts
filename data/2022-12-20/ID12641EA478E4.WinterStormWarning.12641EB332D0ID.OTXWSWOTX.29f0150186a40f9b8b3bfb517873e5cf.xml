<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road conditions for
the state you are calling from can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.
If you must go outside, dress in layers. Several layers of clothes
will keep you warmer than a single heavy coat. Cover exposed skin to
reduce your risk of frostbite or hypothermia. Gloves, a scarf, and a
hat will keep you from losing your body heat.
Wrap pipes with insulation and seal windows to avoid loss of heat
from your home. Keep a slow steady stream of water running from
indoor faucets, and open cabinet doors to allow warm air to
circulate around inside pipes.
Keep pets indoors as much as possible.
Make frequent checks on older family, friends, and neighbors. Ensure
portable heaters are used correctly. Do not use generators or grills
inside.</instruction>
