<headline>Wind Chill Warning issued December 20 at 12:48PM MST until December 23 at 5:00PM MST by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>...EXTREME COLD AND DANGEROUS WIND CHILLS EXPECTED THROUGH
FRIDAY...
...GROUND BLIZZARD CONDITIONS POSSIBLE LATE WEDNESDAY THROUGH
EARLY FRIDAY...
.An Arctic air mass will continue to support dangerously cold
wind chills over western South Dakota and northeastern Wyoming
through the week. The coldest wind chills are expected to occur
Wednesday through Friday, as a quick-moving storm system crosses
the region. This system will also bring a quick shot of snow,
which, combined with strong northwest winds, could lead to
significant blowing of snow. As a result, ground blizzard
conditions will be possible Wednesday through early Friday,
especially over the South Dakota plains.
...WIND CHILL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM MST FRIDAY...
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY MORNING
THROUGH LATE THURSDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...For the Wind Chill Warning, dangerously cold wind
chills. Wind chills as low as 55 below zero. For the Winter
Storm Watch, ground blizzard conditions possible. Total snow
accumulations of up to one inch possible. Winds could gust as
high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...Harding County, Perkins County, Butte County, the
Northern Meade County Plains and Ziebach County. This includes
the Tribal Lands of the Cheyenne River Reservation.
* WHEN...For the Wind Chill Warning, until 5 PM MST Friday. For
the Winter Storm Watch, from Wednesday morning through late
Thursday night.
* IMPACTS...Plan on difficult travel. Widespread blowing snow
could create ground blizzard conditions. The dangerously cold
wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little
as 5 minutes.</description>
<instruction>A Wind Chill Warning means the combination of wind and cold
temperatures will create dangerously low wind chill values. Even
if you are outdoors for just a few minutes, cover all parts of
your body, especially your head, face, and hands.
A Winter Storm Watch for blizzard conditions means falling and
blowing snow with strong winds may produce dangerous whiteout
conditions. Monitor NOAA weather radio, local radio or
television, or the Internet for updates on this potentially
dangerous storm. Take time to prepare for severe winter
conditions before the storm develops.</instruction>
