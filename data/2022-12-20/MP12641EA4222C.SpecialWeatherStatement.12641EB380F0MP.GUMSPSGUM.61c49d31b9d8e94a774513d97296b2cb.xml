<description>...AN UNSETTLED PATTERN EXPECTED FOR THE MARIANAS THROUGH CHRISTMAS
WEEKEND...
A developing wet pattern is expected to affect the Marianas over the
next several days, including Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. A weak
circulation, Invest 94W, located southeast of Eauripik near 2.5N
142E, is expected to move northward toward the Marianas as a shear
line drifts south toward the CNMI. These two systems will interact to
bring increasing convection to the region for the end of the week
into next week, including Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Latest
model guidance varies greatly on expected rainfall, however, they do
agree that the region will see a wet and unsettled pattern into next
week. The current forecast calls for showers to peak across the
region on Friday into Christmas Eve, then slowly diminish through
early next week. Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches, with locally
heavier amounts, are possible. This is not expected to pose a
flooding threat at this time, however, this could change depending on
how the systems develop over the next couple of days. If confidence
in the potential for flooding increases by Wednesday, an Hydrologic
Outlook may be needed.
Gusty winds will continue through Wednesday night, then are expected
to decrease a bit for the remainder of the week. As Invest 94W
approaches the Marianas, gusty winds become a possibility again.
Folks in the Marianas should keep up-to-date with the latest
statements and advisories from the National Weather Service and your
local emergency management offices. Forecast products issued by the
National Weather Service are posted on the WFO Guam web page at
www.weather.gov/gum.</description>
