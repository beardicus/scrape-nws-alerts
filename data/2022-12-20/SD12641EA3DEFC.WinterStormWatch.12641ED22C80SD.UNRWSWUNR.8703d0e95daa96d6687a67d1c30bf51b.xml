<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued December 20 at 1:55AM MST until December 23 at 5:00AM MST by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>...EXTREME COLD EXPECTED THROUGH FRIDAY...
...GROUND BLIZZARD CONDITIONS POSSIBLE WEDNESDAY THROUGH EARLY
FRIDAY...
.An Arctic air mass will continue to support dangerously cold wind
chills over western South Dakota and northeastern Wyoming through
the week. The coldest wind chills are expected to occur Wednesday
through Friday as a quick-moving storm system crosses the region.
This system will also bring a quick shot of snow, which, combined
with strong northwest winds, could lead to significant blowing of
snow. As a result, ground blizzard conditions will be possible
Wednesday through early Friday, especially over the South Dakota
plains.
...WIND CHILL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM MST FRIDAY...
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY MORNING
THROUGH LATE THURSDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...For the Wind Chill Warning, dangerously cold wind chills.
Wind chills as low as 55 below zero. For the Winter Storm Watch,
blizzard conditions possible. Total snow accumulations of up to
two inches possible. Winds could gust as high as 60 mph.
* WHERE...Harding County, Perkins County, Butte County, the
Northern Meade County Plains and Ziebach County. This includes
the Tribal Lands of the Cheyenne River Reservation.
* WHEN...For the Wind Chill Warning, until 5 PM MST Friday. For
the Winter Storm Watch, from Wednesday morning through late
Thursday night.
* IMPACTS...For the Winter Storm Watch, plan on difficult travel.
Widespread blowing snow could lead to ground blizzard
conditions. For the Wind Chill Warning, dangerously cold wind
chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 5
minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The coldest wind chills are expected from
late Wednesday afternoon through Friday morning.</description>
<instruction>A Wind Chill Warning means the combination of wind and cold
temperatures will create dangerously low wind chill values. Even
if you are outdoors for just a few minutes, cover all parts of
your body, especially your head, face, and hands.
A Winter Storm Watch for blizzard conditions means falling and
blowing snow with strong winds may produce dangerous whiteout
conditions. Monitor NOAA weather radio, local radio or
television, or the Internet for updates on this potentially
dangerous storm. Take time to prepare for severe winter
conditions before the storm develops.</instruction>
