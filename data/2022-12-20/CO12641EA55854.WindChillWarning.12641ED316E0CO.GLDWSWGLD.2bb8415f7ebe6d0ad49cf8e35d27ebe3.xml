...WIND CHILL WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 5 PM MST /6 PM CST/
WEDNESDAY TO 11 AM MST /NOON CST/ FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Wind Chill Warning, dangerously cold wind chills
expected. Wind chills as low as 50 below zero. For the Winter
Weather Advisory, snow and blowing snow expected resulting in
low visibilities. Total snow accumulations around 2 inches are
possible. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of east central and northeast Colorado and
northwest and west central Kansas.
* WHEN...For the Wind Chill Warning, from 5 PM MST /6 PM CST/
Wednesday to 11 AM MST /noon CST/ Friday. For the Winter
Weather Advisory, from 11 AM MST /noon CST/ Wednesday to 5 AM
MST /6 AM CST/ Friday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slick road conditions. Blowing snow will
significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions could
impact the morning or evening commute. Gusty winds could bring
down tree branches. The dangerously cold wind chills could cause
frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 5 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...An area of freezing drizzle may develop
along and east of Highway 83 in Kansas late morning through the
afternoon Wednesday. Life threatening cold conditions are
expected for nearly 36 hours along with snow and blowing snow
creating near blizzard conditions Wednesday night. The
combination of these hazards will cause very dangerous travel
conditions Wednesday night, especially if becoming stranded as
road closures are possible.</description>
