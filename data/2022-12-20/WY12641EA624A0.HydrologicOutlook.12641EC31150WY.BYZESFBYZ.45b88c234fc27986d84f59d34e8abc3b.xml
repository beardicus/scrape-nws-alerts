<description>...Rapid ice development on waterways may cause ice jam flooding...
With Arctic cold temperatures in the forecast, expect rivers and
streams across the area to build ice and freeze up. In some locations
the build up of ice could result in ice jam formation and localized
flooding.
Ice normally builds up on rivers and streams gradually and results in
little if any impact. However, when ice accumulates rapidly on
waterways due to the onset of very cold temperatures, there is an
increased threat of ice jam formation.
Ice jams can cause a rapid rise in water levels pushing water and ice
over the banks causing flooding with little warning. Until the
waterways have a chance to stabilize to this newly formed ice, the
threat of ice jam flooding will persist along rivers and streams. The
stabilization process may take a week or two after significant ice
has developed. The good news is that freeze up ice jams are usually
short lived; the bad news is they can occur suddenly and are
unpredictable.
While flooding is not imminent, those living near rivers or streams
should pay close attention to the state of the ice over the next week
or two. Move any equipment or livestock away from low lying areas
adjacent to rivers or streams. Take protective action for any
threatened structures. Be prepared to seek the safety of higher
ground should waters rise. Please report any flooding to local law
enforcement and have them relay the report to the National Weather
Service.</description>
