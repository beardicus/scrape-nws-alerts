expected with areas of blowing snow. Total snow accumulations up
to two inches. Winds gusting as high as 30 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of south central and southeast Montana.
* WHEN...For the Wind Chill Warning, until Noon MST Friday. For the
Winter Weather Advisory, from 10 PM this evening to 6 PM MST
Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Frostbite and hypothermia are possible if precautions
are not taken. Exposed skin may become quickly frostbitten or
frozen. Wind chill values may fall to extremely dangerous levels.

significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions could
impact the Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning commutes. The
dangerously cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin
in as little as 10 minutes.</description>
<instruction>Avoid outside activities if possible. When outside, make sure you
wear appropriate clothing, a hat, and gloves.
Persons are urged to stay indoors until conditions improve. If you
must go outside, dress in layers. Several layers of clothes will
keep you warmer than a single heavy coat. Cover exposed skin to
reduce your risk of frostbite or hypothermia. Gloves, a scarf, and a
hat will keep you from losing your body heat.
Wrap pipes with insulation and seal windows to avoid loss of heat
from your home. Keep a slow steady stream of water running from
indoor faucets, and open cabinet doors to allow warm air to
circulate around inside pipes.
Keep pets indoors as much as possible.
Make frequent checks on older family, friends, and neighbors. Ensure
portable heaters are used correctly. Do not use generators or grills
inside.
Slow down and use caution while traveling. For the latest road
conditions, call 5 1 1.</instruction>
