<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM AKDT THURSDAY FOR
THOMPSON PASS...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions occurring. Visibility reduced to 1/4
mile or less. Total snow accumulations of 10 to 18 inches.
Northeast winds 35 to 50 mph gusting as high as 60 mph.
* WHERE...Thompson Pass.
* WHEN...Until 1 AM AKDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on difficult travel conditions. Widespread
blowing snow will significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The worst conditions are occurring now and
are expected to continue through around to just after midnight.
While the snow is expected to diminish in intensity after
midnight, gusty winds are expected through Thursday morning
which may blow and resuspend the already fallen snow. Expect
gradually improving conditions during the day Thursday as winds
diminish.</description>
<instruction>A Blizzard Warning means severe winter weather conditions are
expected or occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds
and poor visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout
conditions, making travel very hazardous. If you must travel,
have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded, stay
with your vehicle.
For the latest road conditions call 5 1 1 or visit
511.alaska.gov.</instruction>
