<headline>Extreme Fire Danger issued October 12 at 4:29AM CDT  by NWS Sioux Falls</headline>
<description>.DISCUSSION...
Critical fire weather conditions are expected across the forecast
area today and Thursday, thanks to northwest winds gusting as
high as 35 to 50 mph within a very dry air mass. Strongest winds
both days should be toward the James River Valley and south
central South Dakota, with lowest humidity levels also currently
expected through the James River Valley. Those minimum humidity
levels will reach 20-25% this afternoon, falling further to 15-20%
on Thursday afternoon. Farther east into southwest Minnesota,
humidity levels will be slightly higher, but still near to below
critical levels, reaching 25-30% today, and 20-25% on Thursday.
Although humidity levels may not fall below 25% in all locations,
feel the expected strength of the wind gusts and dryness of fuels
warrants a Red Flag Warning for all areas today, and expanded the
headline across all of southwest Minnesota. Have not yet issued
any headlines for Thursday, but with humidity levels expected to
be even lower, and winds similar to today, anticipate that we
will see those headlines issued later today or tonight.
People are urged to exercise extreme care with respect to outdoor
activities that could cause grass fires. Avoid equipment that can
cause sparks near dry grass or brush. Do not toss cigarettes on
the ground. Report new fires quickly to the nearest fire
department or law enforcement office.
...EXTREME FIRE DANGER...
The Grassland Fire Danger Index will reach the extreme category
this afternoon. Extreme weather conditions and very low
moisture content of grasses, and other dry organic material
on the ground, indicate that critical burning conditions exist.
All fires have the potential to become large and spread quickly,
becoming erratic with extreme behavioral characteristics.
No outdoor burning should take place.
OUTLOOK FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON...The Grassland Fire Danger Index
will reach the extreme category.
The grassland fire danger product reflects fire danger for native
grasses. It is not intended for cured agricultural crops, nor
will it reflect conditions in road ditches which have been mowed.</description>
