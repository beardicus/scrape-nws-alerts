<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH 6 AM CDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has expanded the Air
Quality Alert for fine particle pollution. The Air Quality Index
(AQI) is expected to reach the Orange or Unhealthy for Sensitive
Groups category.
* WHERE...Southeast Minnesota.
* WHEN...Through 6 AM CDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease
(including asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults,
may experience health effects.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Smoke from Canadian wildfires has moved into
Minnesota this morning. The smoke will continue slowly moving
south this afternoon and into southeast Minnesota this evening.
In addition, sunny skies, warm temperatures, low humidity, and
light winds will produce an environment for Volatile Organic
Compounds (VOC) and Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) to react in the air
to produce elevated levels of ozone Wednesday afternoon. Ozone
will be elevated across the Twin Cities and Rochester during the
afternoon hours, but will decrease in the evening. Smoke will
gradually clear Thursday morning.

<instruction>The general public should limit prolonged or heavy exertion.
Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including
asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults, should avoid
prolonged or heavy exertion.
Reduce or eliminate activities that contribute to air pollution,
such as outdoor burning, and use of residential wood burning devices.
Reduce vehicle trips and vehicle idling as much as possible.
Keep windows closed overnight to prevent smoke from getting indoors.</instruction>
