<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued June 14 at 2:50AM MDT until June 15 at 9:00PM MDT by NWS Albuquerque</headline>
<description>...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT THURSDAY FOR PORTIONS OF
SOUTHWESTERN AND CENTRAL NEW MEXICO DUE VERY LOW HUMIDITY, STRONG
WINDS, AND AN UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
.An upper level trough approaching from the west will spread
strong west to southwest winds over much of the region Thursday.
The combination of rising temperatures, very low humidity, strong
winds, and an unstable airmass will elevate the risk for critical
fire weather conditions. Any fires that develop over the next few
days will have the potential for significant growth in receptive
fuel beds.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
THURSDAY EVENING...
The National Weather Service in Albuquerque has issued a Fire
Weather Watch...which is in effect from Thursday afternoon
through Thursday evening.
* AREA AND TIMING...East Central Plains (Zone 126) from Thursday
afternoon into the early evening.
* 20 FOOT WINDS...West southwest 20 to 25 mph with gusts up to 35
mph.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...Minimum values of 10 to 15 percent.
* IMPACTS...Any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly.
