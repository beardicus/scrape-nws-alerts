SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Ian has made landfall in southwest Florida at Cayo Costa
this afternoon and will continue to move inland across southwest
Florida the remainder of today. Hazardous conditions extend well away
from the center of the system. The following hazardous conditions can
be expected for South Florida:
* Peak storm surge values of 8 to 12 feet are expected particularly in
surge prone areas between Bonita Beach to Chokoloskee. Peak storm
surge values of 5 to 8 feet are the main concern from Chokoloskee to
East Cape Sable and 2 to 4 feet from East Cape Sable to Card Sound
Road along Florida Bay. The storm surge threat is ongoing , surge will
be slow to subside and may impact the region through late week. This
could lead to significant and life- threatening storm surge flooding
particularly along coastal Collier County.
* Multiple rounds of heavy rainfall associated with rainbands may lead
to flooding across all of South Florida. Additional rainfall will
range 1 to 3 inches locally higher totals possible. Flash- flooding
will continue to be possible.
* Tornadoes embedded in showers and thunderstorms within the outer
rainbands associated with the system have been observed yesterday and
last night. Isolated tornadoes will be possible the remainder of the
evening.
* Hazardous marine, beach, and surf conditions are ongoing.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across
southwest Florida coast. Remain well away from life-threatening
surge having additional devastating impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- Widespread deep inundation, with storm surge flooding greatly
accentuated by powerful battering waves. Structural damage to
buildings, with many washing away. Damage greatly compounded
from considerable floating debris. Locations may be
uninhabitable for an extended period.
- Near-shore escape routes and secondary roads washed out or
severely flooded. Flood control systems and barriers may become
stressed.
- Extreme beach erosion. New shoreline cuts possible.
- Massive damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Numerous small craft broken away from moorings with many lifted
onshore and stranded.
Potential impacts from the main surge event are also now unfolding
across Mainland Monroe. Remain well away from
life-threatening surge having additional significant
to extensive impacts.
Potential impacts from the main surge event are also now unfolding
across coastal Florida Bay. Remain well away from locally
hazardous surge having possible limited impacts.
Elsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact is anticipated.
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
western portions of the interior Glades and Hendry counties. Remain well sheltered from
life-threatening wind having possible extensive
impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some having
window, door, and garage door failures leading to structural
damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed.
Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Locations may be
uninhabitable for weeks.
- Many large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and
roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. Several bridges, causeways, and
access routes impassable.
- Large areas with power and communications outages.
Potential impacts from the main wind event are also now unfolding
across southwest Florida. Remain well sheltered from
dangerous wind having additional limited to
significant impacts.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
South Florida. Remain well guarded against life-threatening flood
waters having possible devastating impacts.
If realized, these impacts include:
- Extreme rainfall flooding may prompt numerous evacuations and
rescues.
- Ditches and canals may overwhelmingly overflow their banks in
many places with deep moving water. Flood control systems and
barriers may become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter numerous structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Numerous places where flood waters may cover escape
routes with streets, parking lots and underpasses submerged.
Driving conditions become very dangerous. Numerous road and
bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
* TORNADOES:
Potential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across South
Florida. Remain well braced against a tornado event having
possible limited impacts. If realized, these impacts
include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, mobile
homes pushed off foundations or overturned, large tree tops and
branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving
vehicles blown off roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Do not enter evacuated areas until officials
have given the all clear to return.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to stay inside and away from windows. Listen for
updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Keep a
battery-powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.
During the peak of the storm be ready to move quickly. Keep your
shoes on and rain gear handy. Boots and athletic shoes offer the best
foot protection if you become unexpectedly exposed to the weather.
If you are prone to flooding or in an area under a storm surge watch
or warning, be prepared for the possibility of a quick and dramatic
rise in water levels.
