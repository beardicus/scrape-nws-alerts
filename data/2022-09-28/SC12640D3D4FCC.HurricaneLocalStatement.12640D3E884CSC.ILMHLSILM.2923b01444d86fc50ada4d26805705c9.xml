Coastal Georgetown, Coastal Horry, and Inland Georgetown
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Central Horry,
Coastal Georgetown, Coastal Horry, and Inland Georgetown
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 620 miles south-southwest of Wilmington NC or about 550

SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
The effects of Hurricane Ian will slowly spread across the
Carolinas later this week. Gusty winds well ahead of the storm will
start on Thursday, possibly reaching Tropical Storm Force. These winds
will increase slightly on Friday. Heavy rain and coastal flooding and
beach erosion are also expected. Rain will taper off on Saturday but
coastal flooding issues may linger.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across Northeast South Carolina. Potential
impacts include:
- Minor to moderate flooding from rainfall may prompt flash flooding.
- Rivers and streams may overflow their banks in isolated locations.
Creeks and ditches will flood and may contain strong
currents.
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible
minor to moderate impacts across Northeast South Carolina.
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
Northeast South Carolina. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes is possible. Unsecured lightweight objects may be
blown about.
- Some large limbs may break from trees. A few shallow rooted or
weak trees may snap or be knocked down. Some fences and roadway
signs damaged.
- A few roads may become impassable due to debris, particularly
within urban or heavily wooded locations. Hazardous driving
conditions are possible, especially for high profile vehicles
on bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages are possible.
Elsewhere across southeast North Carolina and northeast South
Carolina, little to no impact is anticipated.
* SURGE:
Protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across the beaches of Northeast South Carolina and Southeast North
Carolina. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Localized inundation and minor over-wash is possible, mainly
along immediate shorelines and other vulnerable low-lying areas
along the coast. Low spots along waterways and tidal creeks may
also be impacted.
- Some portions of near-shore roads and parking lots may become
covered by surge water. Driving conditions may become hazardous
in places where the surge covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion is possible, mainly in the vulnerable
locations along the ocean front.
- Minor damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers is
possible. A few small craft may break away from moorings if not
properly secured.
- Navigation may be difficult near inlets and waterways, as
navigational aids may be off station or missing.
Elsewhere across southeast North Carolina and northeast South
Carolina, little to no impact is anticipated.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts
across southeast North Carolina and northeast South Carolina.
Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Tornadoes can cause damage to trees, vehicles, boats, and
buildings. Unsecured mobile homes and poorly constructed
structures are particularly vulnerable.
* OTHER COASTAL HAZARDS:
Area beaches will have dangerous rip currents developing late in the week.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Check-in with your emergency points of contact among family, friends,
and workmates. Inform them of your status and well-being. Let them
know how you intend to ride out the storm and when you plan to
check-in again.
Keep cell phones well charged and handy. Also, cell phone chargers
for automobiles can be helpful after the storm. Locate your chargers
and keep them with your cell phone.
Closely monitor NOAA Weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes to
the forecast.
