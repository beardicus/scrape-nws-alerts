<description>...STRONG WINDS LATE THIS EVENING ALONG THE ANCHORAGE HILLSIDE...
A potent, fall-like storm will move towards the area today. Winds
will steadily increase through the day. Sustained winds along the
Hillside and higher elevations should reach 30-40 mph by this
evening. The strongest gusts will be around 55 mph from early
through late evening. For the rest of the Anchorage Bowl, winds
will only be between 10-15 mph out of the north.
Please take time to prepare and secure any loose objects that may
be blown around. Given that many trees still have their leaves
and how wet the ground is after recent rainfall, there is an
outside chance of tree damage. There is still some uncertainty in
exactly how strong the highest winds will be, so interested
parties should continue to monitor the forecast.</description>
