SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
At 1100 AM EDT, the center of Major Hurricane Ian was located about
130 miles north-northwest of Key West, or about 45 miles west-
southwest of Fort Myers. Ian is moving toward the north-northeast near
10 mph. This general motion with a reduction in forward speed is
forecast today, followed by a turn toward the northeast on Thursday. On
the forecast track, the center of Ian is expected to move onshore
in a few hours, move over central Florida tonight and Thursday morning
and emerge over the western Atlantic by late Thursday.
Widespread storm surge flooding originating from the Gulfside up to 4
feet above normal high tide levels is expected from Key West through
Big Pine Key later today. For some islands, the storm surge may
spill from the Gulf side to the oceanside. The peak storm surge levels
likely will occur from around noon through late afternoon. Many
streets will become impassible, with water into ground floor homes and
businesses, especially those in lower elevation areas.
For the Middle and Upper Keys, storm surge flooding of 1 to 3 feet
above normal high tides is possible. The highest storm surge for the
Gulfside and Bayside of the Middle Keys is expected later today during
the afternoon hours, with the storm surge in the Bayside of the Upper
Keys lingering into Thursday through Friday.
Other impacts to the Florida Keys include damaging wind gusts of 50 to
55 mph in isolated squalls, and additional rainfall of one to three
inches, with isolated totals approaching 4 inches through Thursday.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are imminent across the
Lower Keys. If realized, these impacts include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to ground story buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of escape routes and secondary roads become impassable,
especially in usually vulnerable low spots.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across the
Florida Keys. If realized, these impacts include:
- Flood waters can enter some structures if this rain falls during
high tide. Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at low-lying spots and poor drainage areas. Some
streets and parking lots take on moving water as storm drains and
retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions become hazardous.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Residents and visitors who have cars parked on higher ground should
wait until later this afternoon or evening before retrieving their
vehicles.
