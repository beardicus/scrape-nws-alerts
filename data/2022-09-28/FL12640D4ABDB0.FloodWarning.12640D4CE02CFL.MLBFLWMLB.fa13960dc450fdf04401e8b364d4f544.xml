<description>...The National Weather Service in Melbourne FL has issued a Flood
Warning for the following rivers in Florida...
St Johns River Near Above Lake Harney affecting Seminole County.
.As Hurricane Ian moves into east central Florida early this
morning, historic heavy rainfall will continue, leading to quickly
rising levels on the Saint Johns River Above Lake Harney at Geneva.
At this forecast point, the river is currently in Action Stage and
is expected to rise to Minor Flood by early Thursday afternoon,
rising further to Major Flood stage by Saturday morning, potentially
reaching Record Flood Stage early Sunday morning. Interests along
the river should be prepared for major flood impacts. Due to wind
effects and drainage from upstream, the river is forecast to remain
in Major Flood into early next week.

flooding is forecast.
