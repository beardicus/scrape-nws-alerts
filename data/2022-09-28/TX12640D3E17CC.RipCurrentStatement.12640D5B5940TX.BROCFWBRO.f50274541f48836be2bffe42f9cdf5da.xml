<headline>Rip Current Statement issued September 28 at 3:27PM CDT until September 30 at 7:00AM CDT by NWS Brownsville</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING...
...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM CDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents
expected. For the Coastal Flood Statement, isolated minor
coastal flooding of the beaches is expected.
* WHERE...Kenedy Island, Willacy Island and Cameron Island
Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Friday morning.
For the Coastal Flood Statement, until 10 PM CDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Wave run-up may approach the dunes along narrow
beaches. Beach equipment not stowed against or behind the dunes,
such as umbrellas and chairs, could be moved by waves. Vehicles
driving along narrow beaches may experience higher water
levels. Elevated water levels may also occur across the Laguna
Madre and South Bay, and along State Highway 4 west of Boca
Chica State Park. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers
away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A Coastal Flood Advisory may be needed late
Thursday through Thursday night due to the the potential for sea
water reaching or entering the dunes, especially on shallow
beaches, as back swell from Hurricane Ian continues propagating
toward the coast.</description>
<instruction>Do not drive through flooded roadways.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
