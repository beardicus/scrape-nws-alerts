SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Ian is currently moving through the Southeast Gulf of Mexico and
is forecast to continue to strengthen as the system approaches the
southwest coast of Florida today. Regardless of exact landfall location,
hazardous conditions will extend well away from the center of the
system. The following hazardous conditions can be expected for South
Florida:
* Peak storm surge values of 7 to 11 feet are expected particularly in
surge prone areas between Bonita Beach to Chokoloskee. Peak storm
surge values of 4 to 7 feet are the main concern from Chokoloskee to
East Cape Sable and 2 to 4 feet from East Cape Sable to Card Sound
Road along Florida Bay. The storm surge concern will begin today as
Ian continues to approach Southwest Florida. Due to slow motion of the
system, surge will be slow to subside and may impact the region
through late week. This could lead to significant and life-threatening
storm surge flooding particularly along coastal Collier County.
* Multiple rounds of heavy rainfall associated with rainbands may lead
to flooding across all of South Florida. Rainfall totals may range
4 to 8 inches through Thursday with locally higher totals possible.
Flash-flooding will be possible in this environment.
* Tornadoes embedded in showers and thunderstorms within the outer
rainbands associated with the system have been observed yesterday and
last night, and the threat will persist through the day today.
* Hazardous marine and beach conditions are expected. Dangerous surf
conditions are expected along the Gulf coast.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
South Florida. Remain well guarded against life-threatening flood waters
having possible devastating impacts.
If realized, these impacts include:
- Extreme rainfall flooding may prompt numerous evacuations and
rescues.
- Ditches and canals may overwhelmingly overflow their banks in
many places with deep moving water. Flood control systems and
barriers may become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter numerous structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Numerous places where flood waters may cover escape
routes with streets, parking lots and underpasses submerged.
Driving conditions become very dangerous. Numerous road and
bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across
southwest Florida. Remain well away from life-threatening
surge having possible additional devastating impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- Widespread deep inundation, with storm surge flooding greatly
accentuated by powerful battering waves. Structural damage to
buildings, with many washing away. Damage greatly compounded
from considerable floating debris. Locations may be
uninhabitable for an extended period.
- Near-shore escape routes and secondary roads washed out or
severely flooded. Flood control systems and barriers may become
stressed.
- Extreme beach erosion. New shoreline cuts possible.
- Massive damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Numerous small craft broken away from moorings with many lifted
onshore and stranded.
Potential impacts from the main surge event are also now unfolding
across Mainland Monroe. Remain well away from
life-threatening surge having possible significant
to extensive impacts.
Potential impacts from the main surge event are also now unfolding
across coastal Florida Bay. Remain well away from locally
hazardous surge having possible  limited impacts.
Minor coastal flooding may be observed across portions of the east
coast.
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
southwest Florida. Remain well sheltered from life-threatening wind having
possible extensive impacts.
If realized, these impacts include:
- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some having
window, door, and garage door failures leading to structural
damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed.
Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Locations may be
uninhabitable for weeks.
- Many large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and
roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. Several bridges, causeways, and
access routes impassable.
- Large areas with power and communications outages.
Potential impacts from the main wind event are also now unfolding
across Palm Beach. Remain well sheltered from
dangerous wind having possible limited to
significant impacts.
* TORNADOES:
Potential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across South Florida.
Remain well braced against a dangerous tornado event having additional significant impacts.
If realized, these impacts include:
- The occurrence of scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- Several places may experience tornado damage with a few spots
of considerable damage, power loss, and communications failures.
- Locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses, mobile
homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees snapped or
uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed about.
Dangerous projectiles can add to the toll.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Do not enter evacuated areas until officials
have given the all clear to return.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to stay inside and away from windows. Listen for
updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Keep a
battery-powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.
If you are prone to flooding or in an area under a storm surge watch
or warning, be prepared for the possibility of a quick and dramatic
rise in water levels.
If a tornado warning is issued for your area, quickly move to the
safest place within your shelter. Protect your head and body.
