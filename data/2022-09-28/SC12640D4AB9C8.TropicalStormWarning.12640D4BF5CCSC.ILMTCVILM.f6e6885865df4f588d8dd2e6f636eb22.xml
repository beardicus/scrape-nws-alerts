<description>...TROPICAL STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...STORM SURGE WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT...
* LOCATIONS AFFECTED
- Georgetown
- Murrells Inlet
* WIND
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Equivalent Tropical Storm force wind
- Peak Wind Forecast: 35-45 mph with gusts to 55 mph
- Window for Tropical Storm force winds: Friday morning until
early Saturday morning
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for wind 58
to 73 mph
- The wind threat has increased from the previous assessment.
- PLAN: Plan for dangerous wind of equivalent strong tropical
storm force.
- PREPARE: Remaining efforts to protect life and property
should be completed as soon as possible. Prepare for
significant wind damage.
- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant
- Some damage to roofing and siding, along with damage to
porches and awnings. A few buildings experiencing window,
door, and garage door failures. Damage to vulnerable
structures such as carports, sheds and mobile homes is
possible.
- Large limbs will be down with several trees snapped or
uprooted. Several fences and roadway signs may become blown
over. Some roads may become impassable due to large debris
blocking the roadway, especially within urban or heavily
wooded locations. Some bridges, causeways, and elevated
roads may be impacted by high winds making driving on them
hazardous.
- Scattered power and communications outages are possible,
but more prevalent in areas with above ground lines.
- Small craft that are not properly moored may break loose.
* STORM SURGE
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible
- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 2-4 feet
above ground somewhere within surge prone areas
- Window of concern: Friday morning until Friday evening
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm
surge flooding greater than 3 feet above ground
- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the
previous assessment.
- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of
greater than 3 feet above ground.
- PREPARE: Evacuation efforts and flood preparations should
soon be brought to completion before conditions become
unsafe.
- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for
your area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or
needlessly risk lives.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant
- Areas of storm surge inundation enhanced by breaking waves
are possible along the barrier islands. Damage to several
buildings is possible, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore roads may become weakened or washed
out, especially in vulnerable low-lying areas.
- Delivery of drinking water and sewer services may be
interrupted.
- Major beach erosion is possible with heavy surf and
elevated water levels impacting or breaching the dunes.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft will break away from moorings,
especially in unprotected anchorages.
- Navigation may be difficult near inlets and waterways, as
navigational aids may be off station or missing.
* FLOODING RAIN
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:
- Peak Rainfall Amounts: 4-8 inches, with locally higher
amounts
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for major
flooding rain
- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from
the previous assessment.
- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for
major flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues are
likely.
- PREPARE: Strongly consider protective actions, especially
if you are in an area vulnerable to flooding.
- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take
action will likely result in serious injury or loss of life.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive
- Major flooding from rainfall may prompt evacuations and
numerous rescues.
- Rivers and streams may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Creeks and ditches will flood and may
contain strong currents.
- Flood waters may enter many structures, and some may become
uninhabitable. Some road scours or complete road failures
will be possible, along with the potential for sinkholes.
Many streets and parking lots may flood, and may be
impacted by flowing water. Many road and low-lying bridge
closures are possible with some weakened or washed away.
Driving conditions will be dangerous.The delivery of
drinking water and sewer services may be interrupted. Flood
waters may be polluted and contain hazardous materials.
* TORNADO
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:
- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for a few
tornadoes
- The tornado threat has remained nearly steady from the
previous assessment.
- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a
few tornadoes.
- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to
tornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before
hazardous weather arrives.
- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter
quickly.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the
execution of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with
power and communications disruptions.
- Tornadoes can cause damage to trees, vehicles, boats, and
buildings. Unsecured mobile homes and poorly constructed
structures are particularly vulnerable.
