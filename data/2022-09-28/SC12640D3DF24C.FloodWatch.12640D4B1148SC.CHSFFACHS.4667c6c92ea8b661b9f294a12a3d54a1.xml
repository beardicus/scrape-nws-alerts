South Carolina. Rounds of showers and thunderstorms

areas Thursday evening into Saturday morning. Moderate to
heavy rainfall rates during high tide cycles could also
exacerbate flooding at coastal locations, especially on
Friday.

should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.
Be prepared to protect life and property, especially in areas prone
to flooding. If flooding develops, move to higher ground
immediately. If driving, be prepared for flooded roadways and
