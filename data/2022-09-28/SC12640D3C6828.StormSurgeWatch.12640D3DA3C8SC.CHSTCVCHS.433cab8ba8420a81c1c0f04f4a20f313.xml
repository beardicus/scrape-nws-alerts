<description>...TROPICAL STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...STORM SURGE WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT...
* LOCATIONS AFFECTED
- Jasper
- Levy
* WIND
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Below tropical storm force wind
- Peak Wind Forecast: 20-30 mph with gusts to 40 mph
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for wind 39
to 57 mph
- The wind threat has decreased from the previous assessment.
- PLAN: Plan for hazardous wind of equivalent tropical storm
force.
- PREPARE: Efforts to protect property should now be
underway. Prepare for limited wind damage.
- ACT: Act now to complete preparations before the wind
becomes hazardous.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees
are shallow rooted.
- Some roads impassable due to debris, particularly within
urban or heavily wooded locations. Hazardous driving
conditions on bridges and other elevated roadways,
especially for high profile vehicles.
- Isolated to scattered power and communications outages.
* STORM SURGE
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible
- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 2-4 feet
above ground somewhere within surge prone areas
- Window of concern: early Thursday morning until Saturday
evening
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm
surge flooding greater than 3 feet above ground
- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the
previous assessment.
- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of
greater than 3 feet above ground.
- PREPARE: Evacuation efforts and flood preparations should
soon be brought to completion before conditions become
unsafe.
- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for
your area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or
needlessly risk lives.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant
- Areas of inundation of saltwater along immediate shorelines
and in low-lying spots farther inland near rivers and
creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by waves.
Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads
become weakened or washed out, especially in normally
vulnerable low spots.
- Moderate to major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching
dunes. Strong and numerous rip currents.
- Minor to moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and
piers. Several small craft broken away from moorings,
especially in unprotected anchorages. Some navigation aids
possibly displaced well off station, creating difficult
navigation near inlets and waterways.
* FLOODING RAIN
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:
- Peak Rainfall Amounts: 4-8 inches, with locally higher
amounts
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for major
flooding rain
- The flooding rain threat has increased from the previous
assessment.
- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for
major flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues are
likely.
- PREPARE: Strongly consider protective actions, especially
if you are in an area vulnerable to flooding.
- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take
action will likely result in serious injury or loss of life.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive
- Major rainfall flooding could prompt many rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries could rapidly overflow their banks
in multiple locations. Small streams, creeks, canals,
ditches may become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems
and barriers could become stressed.
- Flood waters could enter many structures within multiple
communities; some structures become uninhabitable or are
washed away. Flood waters could cover multiple escape
routes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving
water with underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become
dangerous. Many road and bridge closures with some weakened
or washed out.
- Drinking water and sewer services could be negatively
impacted.
- Hazardous containers and materials could possibly be
present in flood waters.
* TORNADO
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:
- Situation is unfavorable for tornadoes
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Tornadoes not expected
- The tornado threat has decreased from the previous
assessment.
- PLAN: Tornadoes are not expected. Showers and thunderstorms
with gusty winds may still occur.
- PREPARE: Little to no preparations needed to protect
against tornadoes at this time. Keep informed of the latest
tornado situation.
- ACT: Listen for changes in the forecast.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Little to None
- Little to no potential impacts from tornadoes.
