SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
At 1100 AM, Major Hurricane Ian was located over the southeast Gulf of
Mexico, about 170 miles south-southwest of Orlando. Ian`s maximum
sustained winds are 155 mph, making it an Extremely Dangerous High End
Category Four Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Ian
is moving north-northeast around 10 mph, and will move onshore the
southwest Florida coast early this afternoon.
After landfall, Ian will weaken as it continues moving north-northeast
over the Florida peninsula through tonight and into Thursday. Its
track will take it across the interior counties of east central
Florida.
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Indian River, St. Lucie, and
Martin counties and adjacent Atlantic waters. A Hurricane Warning
continues for Lake, Seminole, Orange, Osceola, and Okeechobee counties.
In addition, the Hurricane Warning has been expanded to include
Brevard and Volusia counties and adjacent Atlantic waters.
Ian will approach and then move across the region at a slightly slower
forward speed tonight into Thursday. Significant to extensive wind
impacts are expected from Ian, with the onset of Tropical Storm Force
wind gusts associated with the outer bands of Ian, beginning this
afternoon and continuing through Thursday. Hurricane conditions are
expected with the passage of the center of the storm across portions
of the inland counties. In addition, Hurricane Force Gusts are now
expected across portions of Volusia and Brevard counties. Wind impacts
may linger into late Thursday night across the far northern portions
of east central Florida, especially across Volusia County.
A Flood Watch continues for all of east central Florida through late
Thursday night. Catastrophic flooding impacts are expected to develop
throughout the day, and widespread heavy rainfall is expected to
continue through Thursday night. Storm total rainfall amounts are
forecast to range from 12 to 18 inches with localized amounts greater
than 20 inches occurring over areas north of a line from Kissimmee to
near New Smyrna Beach.
Expect 8 to 15 inches with isolated 18 inch amounts from Melbourne to
Lake Kissimmee, and 4 to 8 inches with isolated 12 inch totals farther
south. This amount of rainfall will cause major flooding for portions
of the area, especially for locations that have already received high
rainfall amounts over the past 7 days. Creeks and rivers that are
already approaching bankfull will overflow, leading to substantial
flooding. Urban locations and low-lying areas are especially
vulnerable with inundation of major roadways and flooding of
structures expected.
An increasingly favorable environment for tornadoes will continue
across east central Florida today through Thursday. A Tornado Watch is
in effect for all east central Florida counties except for Lake and
Volusia County through 5 PM.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
east central Florida. Remain well guarded against life-threatening
flood waters having possible devastating impacts. If realized, these
impacts include:
- Extreme rainfall flooding may prompt numerous evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may overwhelmingly overflow their banks
in many places with deep moving water. Small streams, creeks,
canals, and ditches may become raging rivers. In mountain
areas, deadly runoff may rage down valleys while increasing
susceptibility to rockslides and mudslides. Flood control
systems and barriers may become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter numerous structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Numerous places where flood waters may cover escape
routes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of raging water
with underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become very
dangerous. Numerous road and bridge closures with some weakened
or washed out.
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
east central Florida. Remain well sheltered from life-threatening wind
having extensive impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some having
window, door, and garage door failures leading to structural
damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed.
Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Locations may be
uninhabitable for weeks.
- Many large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and
roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. Several bridges, causeways, and
access routes impassable.
- Large areas with power and communications outages.
* TORNADOES:
Potential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across East
Central Florida. Remain well braced against a dangerous tornado event
having significant impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- The occurrence of scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- Several places may experience tornado damage with a few spots
of considerable damage, power loss, and communications failures.
- Locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses, mobile
homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees snapped or
uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed about.
Dangerous projectiles can add to the toll.
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across
east central Florida. Remain well away from locally hazardous surge
having possible limited impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread
with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where
surge water covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions, including
possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so immediately.
For those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind, falling
trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move, relocate to
a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help keep roadways open
for those under evacuation orders.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
Failure to adequately shelter may result in serious injury or loss of
life. Always heed the advice of local officials and comply with any
orders that are issued. Remember, during the storm 9 1 1 Emergency
Services may not be able to immediately respond if conditions are
unsafe. This should be a big factor in your decision making.
Keep cell phones well charged. Cell phone chargers for automobiles
can be helpful, but be aware of your risk for deadly carbon monoxide
poisoning if your car is left idling in a garage or other poorly
ventilated area.
It is important to remain calm, informed, and focused during an
emergency. Be patient and helpful with those you encounter.
If you are a visitor, be sure to know the name of the city or town in
which you are staying and the name of the county or parish in which
it resides. Listen for these locations in local news updates. Pay
attention for instructions from local authorities.
Rapidly rising flood waters are deadly. If you are in a flood-prone
area, consider moving to higher ground. Never drive through a flooded
roadway. Remember, turn around don`t drown!
If a Tornado Warning is issued for your area, be ready to shelter
quickly, preferably away from windows and in an interior room not
prone to flooding. If driving, scan the roadside for quick shelter
options.
If in a place that is vulnerable to high wind, such as near large
trees, a manufactured home, upper floors of a high-rise building, or
on a boat, consider moving to a safer shelter before the onset of
strong winds or flooding.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
