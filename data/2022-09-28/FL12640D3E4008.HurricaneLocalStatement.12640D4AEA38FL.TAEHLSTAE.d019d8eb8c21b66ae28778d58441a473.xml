NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Coastal Dixie,
Coastal Franklin, Coastal Jefferson, Coastal Taylor, Coastal
Wakulla, and Inland Dixie
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 280 miles southeast of Indian Pass or about 180 miles

SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
As of 5PM EDT, Major Hurricane Ian made landfall as a category 4
hurricane near Cayo Costa around 305 PM EDT. The forecast track has
changed little since the previous advisory. Hurricane Ian is
expected to trek across central Florida tomorrow.
Hurricane Ian`s large wind field keeps the potential for sustained
tropical storm winds across the Gulf of Mexico and southeast Florida
Big Bend. Along the coastal Big Bend and inland Dixie County,
occasional gusts to tropical storm force are possible. Even though
Hurricane Ian is forecast to exit Florida tomorrow, gusty winds will
persist through Friday.
Forecast rainfall amounts continue to trend downwards. East of the
Apalachicola and Flint Rivers amounts range from 0.10 inches to 1.50
inches or less. The higher amounts are expected along the I-75
corridor and down into the far southeast Big Bend.
Tropical Storm Warnings remain in effect along the coast from Indian
Pass to the Suwannee River, including inland Dixie County.
There is currently no storm surge threat due to Hurricane Ian making
landfall in southwestern Florida.
Forecast confidence remains high for the tri-state area. We will
continue provide additional details on Ian over the next several
advisory cycles.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across the
far southeast Florida Big Bend and coastal communities from Indian
Pass to the Suwanee River. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across eastern Florida panhandle, Florida Big Bend,
southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia, little to no impact is
anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
The threat for dangerous rainfall flooding has diminished. Flooding
may still be possible across the I-75 corridor of southwestern Georgia
and the extreme southwest Florida Big Bend. Potential impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, and ditches
overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
Elsewhere across eastern Florida panhandle, Florida Big Bend,
southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia, little to no impact is
anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
If in a place that is vulnerable to high wind, such as near large
trees, a manufactured home, upper floors of a high-rise building, or
on a boat, plan to move to safe shelter.
If you are a visitor, know the name of the county in which you are
located and where it is relative to current watches and warnings. If
staying at a hotel, ask the management staff about their onsite
disaster plan. Listen for evacuation orders, especially pertaining to
area visitors.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes
to the forecast.

warrant.</description>
