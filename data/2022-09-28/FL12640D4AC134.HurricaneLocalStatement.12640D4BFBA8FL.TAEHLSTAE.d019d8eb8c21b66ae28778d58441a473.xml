<description>This product covers eastern Florida panhandle, Florida Big Bend, southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia
** HURRICANE IAN CONTINUING TO TRACK ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA **
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Coastal Dixie,
Coastal Franklin, Coastal Jefferson, Coastal Taylor, Coastal
Wakulla, and Inland Dixie
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 320 miles southeast of Panama City or about 270 miles
southeast of Apalachicola
- 27.5N 81.4W
- Storm Intensity 90 mph
- Movement North-northeast or 30 degrees at 8 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
As of 11PM EDT, Hurricane Ian (now category 1) was moving north-
northeast across south-central Florida near Sebring. The forecast
track continues this motion through tonight before emerging off the
northeast Florida coast Thursday afternoon or evening as a tropical
storm.
Although Ian should continue steadily weakening while crossing central
Florida, the large wind field keeps the potential for tropical storm
force winds (mainly in gusts) across the Gulf of Mexico, coastal
Apalachee Bay, and the southeast Florida Big Bend. As such, Tropical
Storm Warnings remain in effect along the coast from Indian Pass to
the Suwannee River, including inland Dixie County until Friday
morning.
Forecast rainfall amounts have once again decreased with the highest
amounts now around 1 inch along the I-75 corridor and southeast
Florida Big Bend from Ian`s outer rainbands. Less than a half-inch is
forecast roughly along and west of a Dothan to Perry line.
No tornado or storm surge impacts are expected.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across the
far southeast Florida Big Bend and coastal communities from Indian
Pass to the Suwanee River. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across eastern Florida panhandle, Florida Big Bend,
southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia, little to no impact is
anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across the southeast Florida Big Bend and south-central
Georgia. Potential impacts include:
- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter currents.
Small streams, creeks, and ditches may become swollen and
overflow in spots.
- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually
vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding of water
occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become
near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge
closures.
Elsewhere across eastern Florida panhandle, Florida Big Bend,
southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia, little to no impact is
anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Keep cell phones well charged. Cell phone chargers for automobiles
can be helpful, but be aware of your risk for deadly carbon monoxide
poisoning if your car is left idling in a garage or other poorly
ventilated area.
If you are a visitor, be sure to know the name of the city in which
you are staying and the name of the county in which it resides.
Listen for these locations in local news updates. Pay attention for
instructions from local authorities.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.

Service in Tallahassee FL around 5 AM EDT, or sooner if conditions
warrant.</description>
