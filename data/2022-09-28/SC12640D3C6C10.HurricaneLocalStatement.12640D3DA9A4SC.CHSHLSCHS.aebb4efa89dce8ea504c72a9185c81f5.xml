SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Ian will slowly track northward across the eastern Gulf
of Mexico and Florida through Thursday then approach coastal portions
of Georgia and southern South Carolina Friday. Although the storm will
weaken as it moves farther north into Georgia and South Carolina
through the weekend, significant impacts from storm surge inundation,
heavy rain, and tropical storm force winds are likely across the
region along with a few tornadoes. The worst conditions should remain
along the coast. The combination of significant storm surge inundation
and heavy rainfall could produce areas of considerable flooding,
especially Friday. In addition, dangerous marine and surf conditions
as well as significant beach erosion are expected.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Protect against life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across south coastal South Carolina and north coastal Georgia.
Potential impacts in this area include:
- Areas of inundation of saltwater along immediate shorelines and
in low-lying spots farther inland near rivers and creeks, with
storm surge flooding accentuated by waves. Damage to several
buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in normally vulnerable low
spots.
- Moderate to major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching
dunes. Strong and numerous rip currents.
- Minor to moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and
piers. Several small craft broken away from moorings,
especially in unprotected anchorages. Some navigation aids
possibly displaced well off station, creating difficult
navigation near inlets and waterways.
Also, protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across Southeast South Carolina and Southeast Georgia
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across Southeast South Carolina and Southeast Georgia,
especially at the coast. Potential impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding could prompt many rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries could rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple locations. Small streams, creeks, canals, ditches may
become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and barriers
could become stressed.
- Flood waters could enter many structures within multiple
communities; some structures become uninhabitable or are washed
away. Flood waters could cover multiple escape routes. Streets
and parking lots become rivers of moving water with underpasses
submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous. Many road and
bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
- Drinking water and sewer services could be negatively impacted.
- Hazardous containers and materials could possibly be present in
flood waters.
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible
significant impacts across Southeast South Carolina and Southeast
Georgia.
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
Southeast South Carolina and Southeast Georgia. Potential impacts
include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or uprooted,
but with greater numbers in places where trees are shallow
rooted.
- Some roads impassable due to debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded locations. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways, especially for high
profile vehicles.
- Isolated to scattered power and communications outages.
* OTHER COASTAL HAZARDS:
Life-threatening surf conditions, including dangerous rip currents, high
waves, and beach erosion are likely across coastal portions of Southeast
South Carolina and Southeast Georgia.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts
across mainly coastal areas of Southeast South Carolina and Southeast
Georgia. Potential impacts include:
- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency plans.
- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along with
power and communications disruptions.
- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees, vehicles,
boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and other poorly
constructed structures.
Elsewhere across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia,
little to no impact is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions, including
possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so immediately.
For those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind, falling
trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move, relocate to
a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help keep roadways open
for those under evacuation orders.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies
kit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your
home or business.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
near the ocean or a large inland lake, in a low-lying or poor
drainage area, in a valley, or near an already swollen river, plan to
move to safe shelter on higher ground.
Storm surge is the leading killer associated with tropical storms and
hurricanes! Make sure you are in a safe area away from the surge
zone. Even if you are not in a surge-prone area, you could find
yourself cutoff by flood waters during and after the storm. Heed
evacuation orders issued by the local authorities.
Rapidly rising flood waters are deadly. If you are in a flood-prone
area, consider moving to higher ground. Never drive through a flooded
roadway. Remember, turn around don`t drown!
