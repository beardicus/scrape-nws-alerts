<headline>Flood Warning issued September 28 at 11:14AM EDT until further notice by NWS Melbourne</headline>
<description>...Forecast flooding changed from Moderate to Major severity for the
following rivers in Florida...
St Johns River Near Astor affecting Volusia and Lake Counties.
.As Hurricane Ian moves onshore to the southwest Florida coast
today, historic heavy rainfall will spread across Central Florida,
leading to quickly rising levels on the Saint Johns River at Astor.
At this forecast point, the river is currently in Minor Flood Stage
and is expected to rise to Major Flood stage by Thursday evening,
potentially reaching Record Flood Stage early Friday morning.
Interests along the river should be prepared for major flood
impacts, with flood levels greater than observed during Irma in
2017. Due to wind effects and drainage from upstream, the river is
forecast to remain in Major Flood through the weekend.
For the St. Johns River...including Astor...Major flooding is
forecast.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
The next statement will be issued Thursday morning at 1100 AM EDT.
