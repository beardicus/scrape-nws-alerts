SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Extremely dangerous category 4 Hurricane Ian will move ashore this afternoon
on the southwest Florida coast. The hurricane will track north northeast
today and then northeast to north Thursday and Friday. Weakening is
expected after landfall. Ian could be near hurricane strength when
it moves over the Florida East coast Thursday.
On this track, Ian will make a very close approach to the local area
as it moves northward off the coast Thursday through Friday. Extensive
to potentially extreme flash flood is expected over the area, with the
main areas of concern over northeast Florida to coastal southeast
Georgia.
A flood watch is in effect for parts of the area. Increasing rain
chances are expected today and tonight, with more rain and squalls
and embedded thunderstorms occurring. Persistent moderate to heavy
rainfall is expected to develop further Thursday through Friday morning.
Moderate to possible major river flooding expected in northeast FL
later this week, especially for the Sante Fe, St Marys, and Black
Creek Rivers. A storm surge warning is in effect along the coast as well
as the St Johns River with storm surge inundation up to 6 feet along
the coast, 3 to 5 feet for the St Johns River from just west of
Mayport to Julington Creek, and St Johns River south of
Julington of 2 to 4 feet.
A hurricane watch is in effect along the coast of northeast FL and
southeast GA, with tropical storm warnings up for portions of
northeast FL and southeast GA. Tropical storm conditions will be developing
over northeast FL through this evening, and then extending north
into southeast Georgia tonight and Thursday.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
devastating impacts across parts of northeast Florida and north
central Florida. Potential impacts include:
- Extreme rainfall flooding may prompt numerous evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may overwhelmingly overflow their banks
in many places with deep moving water. Small streams, creeks,
canals, and ditches may become raging rivers. Flood control
systems and barriers may become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter numerous structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Numerous places where flood waters may cover escape
routes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of raging water
with underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become very
dangerous. Numerous road and bridge closures with some weakened
or washed out.
Protect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
significant to extensive impacts across Suwannee Valley of northeast
Florida and southeast Georgia.
* SURGE:
Protect against life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across coastal southeast Georgia, coastal northeast Florida,
intracoastal waterway, and the St. Johns River basin. Potential
impacts in this area include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
- If you flooded in Hurricanes Matthew or Irma, you need to take
immediate precautions to protect life and property.
Also, protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across inland Glynn, Nassau, and Camden counties.
* WIND:
Protect against life-threatening wind having possible extensive
impacts across portions of northeast Florida, north central FL, and
southeast Georgia. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some having
window, door, and garage door failures leading to structural
damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed.
Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Locations may be
uninhabitable for weeks.
- Many large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and
roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. Several bridges, causeways, and
access routes impassable.
- Large areas with power and communications outages.
Also, protect against dangerous wind having possible limited to
significant impacts across the rest of the forecast area.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a dangerous tornado event having possible significant
impacts across parts of Flagler county. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of tornadoes can hinder the execution of
emergency plans during tropical events.
- Several places may experience tornado damage with a few spots
of considerable damage, power loss, and communications failures.
- Locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses, mobile
homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees snapped or
uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed about.
Dangerous projectiles can add to the toll.
Elsewhere across coastal northeast Florida, north central FL, and
coastal Southeast Georgia, little to no impact is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
For those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,
falling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move,
relocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help
keep roadways open for those under evacuation orders.
If evacuating, leave with a destination in mind and allow extra time
to get there. Take your emergency supplies kit. Gas up your vehicle
ahead of time.
Let others know where you are going prior to departure. Secure loose
items and pets in the car, and avoid distracted driving.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies
kit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your
home or business.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
If in a place that is vulnerable to high wind, such as near large
trees, a manufactured home, upper floors of a high-rise building, or
on a boat, plan to move to safe shelter.
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
near the ocean or a large inland lake, in a low-lying or poor
drainage area, in a valley, or near an already swollen river, plan to
move to safe shelter on higher ground.
Always heed the advice of local officials and comply with orders that
are issued. Do not needlessly jeopardize your life or the lives of
others.
When securing your property, outside preparations should be concluded
as soon as possible before conditions deteriorate. The onset of
strong gusty winds or flooding can cause certain preparedness
activities to become unsafe.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes
to the forecast.
There is a threat from tornadoes with this storm. Have multiple ways
to receive Tornado Warnings. Be ready to shelter quickly.
