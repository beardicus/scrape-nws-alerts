<description>...STORM SURGE WARNING IN EFFECT...
...HURRICANE WATCH IN EFFECT...
...TROPICAL STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT...
A Hurricane Watch means hurricane-force winds are possible somewhere
within this area within the next 48 hours
A Storm Surge Warning means there is a danger of life-threatening
inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline,
somewhere within this area within the next 36 hours
* LOCATIONS AFFECTED
- Savannah
- Tybee Island
- Ossabaw Island
* WIND
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Equivalent Tropical Storm force wind
- Peak Wind Forecast: 40-50 mph with gusts to 65 mph
- Window for Tropical Storm force winds: Thursday evening
until Friday afternoon
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for wind 58
to 73 mph
- The wind threat has remained nearly steady from the
previous assessment.
- PLAN: Plan for dangerous wind of equivalent strong tropical
storm force.
- PREPARE: Remaining efforts to protect life and property
should be completed as soon as possible. Prepare for
significant wind damage.
- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with
damage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few
buildings experiencing window, door, and garage door
failures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.
Unsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within
urban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges and access
routes impassable.
- Travel by vehicle or on foot increasingly difficult. Danger
of death or injury from falling objects such as trees or
electric wires outside.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more
prevalent in areas with above ground lines, which could
persist for hours or days.
- Some poorly secured small craft could break loose from
their moorings.
* STORM SURGE
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible
- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 3-5 feet
above ground somewhere within surge prone areas
- Window of concern: Thursday morning until Saturday evening
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm
surge flooding greater than 3 feet above ground
- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the
previous assessment.
- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of
greater than 3 feet above ground.
- PREPARE: Evacuation efforts and flood preparations should
soon be brought to completion before conditions become
unsafe.
- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for
your area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or
needlessly risk lives.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant
- Areas of inundation of saltwater along immediate shorelines
and in low-lying spots farther inland near rivers and
creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by waves.
Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads
become weakened or washed out, especially in normally
vulnerable low spots.
- Moderate to major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching
dunes. Strong and numerous rip currents.
- Minor to moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and
piers. Several small craft broken away from moorings,
especially in unprotected anchorages. Some navigation aids
possibly displaced well off station, creating difficult
navigation near inlets and waterways.
* FLOODING RAIN
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:
- Peak Rainfall Amounts: 4-8 inches, with locally higher
amounts
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for major
flooding rain
- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from
the previous assessment.
- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for
major flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues are
likely.
- PREPARE: Strongly consider protective actions, especially
if you are in an area vulnerable to flooding.
- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take
action will likely result in serious injury or loss of life.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive
- Major rainfall flooding could prompt many rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries could rapidly overflow their banks
in multiple locations. Small streams, creeks, canals,
ditches may become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems
and barriers could become stressed.
- Flood waters could enter many structures within multiple
communities; some structures become uninhabitable or are
washed away. Flood waters could cover multiple escape
routes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving
water with underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become
dangerous. Many road and bridge closures with some weakened
or washed out.
- Drinking water and sewer services could be negatively
impacted.
- Hazardous containers and materials could possibly be
present in flood waters.
* TORNADO
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:
- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for a few
tornadoes
- The tornado threat has remained nearly steady from the
previous assessment.
- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a
few tornadoes.
- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to
tornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before
hazardous weather arrives.
- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter
quickly.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited
- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency
plans.
- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along
with power and communications disruptions.
- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees,
vehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and
other poorly constructed structures.
