<headline>Flood Warning issued September 28 at 11:03PM EDT until further notice by NWS Melbourne</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in Florida...
St Johns River Near Astor affecting Volusia and Lake Counties.
.As Hurricane Ian moves into east central Florida early this
morning, historic heavy rainfall will continue, leading to quickly
rising levels on the Saint Johns River at Astor. At this forecast
point, the river has rise to Moderate Flood Stage and is expected to
rise to Major Flood stage by tomorrow afternoon, reaching Record
Flood Stage early Friday morning.
Interests along the river should be prepared for major flood
impacts, with flood levels greater than observed during Irma in

forecast to remain in Major Flood through the weekend.

forecast.
