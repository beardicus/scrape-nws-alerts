SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
* Hurricane Ian has made landfall in southwest Florida at Cayo Costa
this afternoon and will continue to move inland across central Florida
the remainder of tonight. Hazardous conditions extend well away from
the center of the system. The following hazardous conditions can be
expected for South Florida:
* Peak storm surge values of 5 to 8 feet are expected particularly in
surge prone areas between Bonita Beach to Chokoloskee. Peak storm
surge values of 3 to 5 feet are the main concern from Chokoloskee to
East Cape Sable and 1 to 3 feet from East Cape Sable to Card Sound
Road along Florida Bay. The storm surge threat is ongoing, surge will
be slow to subside and may impact the region through late week. This
could lead to significant and life- threatening storm surge flooding
particularly along coastal Collier County.
* Some residual flooding will be possible across portions of Collier,
Glades and Hendry counties due to earlier rainfall.
* Tornadoes embedded in showers and thunderstorms within the outer
rainbands associated with the system have been observed yesterday and
last night. Isolated tornadoes will be possible through Thursday
morning.
* Hazardous marine, beach, and surf conditions are ongoing. *
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across
the Southwestern Florida Gulf Coast. Remain well away from life-threatening
surge having additional extensive impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- Large areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding
accentuated by battering waves. Structural damage to buildings,
with several washing away. Damage compounded by floating
debris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.
- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads
washed out or severely flooded. Flood control systems and
barriers may become stressed.
- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.
- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many
small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages with some lifted onshore and stranded.
Elsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact is anticipated.
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
Western portions of the area. Remain well sheltered from
life-threatening wind having possible extensive
impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some having
window, door, and garage door failures leading to structural
damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed.
Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Locations may be
uninhabitable for weeks.
- Many large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and
roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. Several bridges, causeways, and
access routes impassable.
- Large areas with power and communications outages.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
Northwestern portions of the area. Remain well guarded against dangerous
flood waters having possible significant impacts.
If realized, these impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Ditches and canals may quickly become swollen with swift
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
* TORNADOES:
Potential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across Southeastern Florida. Remain well braced against a tornado event
having possible limited impacts. If realized,
these impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, mobile
homes pushed off foundations or overturned, large tree tops and
branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving
vehicles blown off roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.
Elsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Do not enter evacuated areas until officials
have given the all clear to return.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to stay inside and away from windows. Listen for
updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Keep a
battery-powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.
If you are prone to flooding or in an area under a storm surge watch
or warning, be prepared for the possibility of a quick and dramatic
rise in water levels.
