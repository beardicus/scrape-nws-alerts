<headline>Excessive Heat Watch issued August 30 at 1:29PM PDT until September 05 at 11:00PM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...EXCESSIVE HEAT WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY MORNING THROUGH
MONDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Dangerously hot conditions with temperatures up to
100-105 degrees expected over the holiday weekend with well
above normal overnight low temperatures of 65 to 70. These
temperatures will reach or exceed daily records in many places.
* WHERE...All of western Nevada and northeast California,
including the cities of Reno, Sparks, Carson City, Minden,
Yerington, Fallon, Fernley, Nixon, Lovelock, Hawthorne, Gerlach,
Susanville, and Cedarville.
* WHEN...From Saturday morning through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...Extreme heat will significantly increase the potential
for heat related illnesses, particularly for those without
sufficient cooling or hydration resources, and those working or
participating in outdoor activities.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...While daytime high temperatures will be
near or above records, limited overnight cooling and the
duration of extreme heat will exacerbate heat health impacts
especially for those without air conditioning.</description>
<instruction>Be prepared to drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned
room, stay out of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors.
Young children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances. This is especially true during warm or
hot weather when car interiors can reach lethal temperatures in a
matter of minutes.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when possible.
To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent rest breaks
in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone overcome by heat
should be moved to a cool and shaded location. Heat stroke is an
emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
