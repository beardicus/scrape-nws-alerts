<headline>Coastal Flood Watch issued January 15 at 5:52AM EST until January 17 at 10:00AM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH
MONDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...One to two feet of inundation above ground level
possible in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...New York (Manhattan) County.
* WHEN...From late Sunday night through Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...Widespread moderate flooding of vulnerable areas is
possible near the waterfront and shoreline, including roads,
parking lots, parks, lawns, and homes and businesses with
basements near the waterfront. Several road closures are
possible, and vehicles parked in vulnerable areas near the
waterfront may become flooded. Flooding will also extend
inland from the waterfront along tidal rivers and bays.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The potential for widespread moderate
coastal flooding (2 to 2 1/2 ft above ground level) will
depend on strong easterly winds continuing through the time of
high tide Monday morning. The higher probability at this time
is that winds weaken and shift to the south before high tide,
which would likely keep flooding at widespread minor to
locally moderate flood levels (1 1/2 to 2 ft above ground).
Things could change over the next 60 hours so please monitor
subsequent forecasts through the weekend for the latest
information.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
