<description>...Tonight will be frigid once again, but with less wind than last
night...
Arctic high pressure will bring clear skies, light winds and very
cold temperatures to the area tonight. Winds will be light so wind
chills will not be a factor, however actual temperatures will fall
to near or below zero. In the area from the Capital District south
through the mid-Hudson Valley overnight lows will be mostly zero
to 5 below, although a few normally colder locations could see 10
below. Most of the rest of eastern New York and western New
England will range from 5 to 15 below. The coldest readings will
be found over the Adirondacks, were some locations will be as cold
as minus 20.
The lack of wind will make conditions a bit more tolerable than
last night, however anyone venturing outside should be prepared
for very cold conditions.</description>
