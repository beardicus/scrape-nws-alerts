<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT TONIGHT
TO MIDNIGHT EST SUNDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation expected. Total snow
accumulations of 6 to 12 inches expected over the North
Carolina foothills. 2 to 5 inches of sleet, snow, and ice are
expected from the northeast Georgia and South Carolina
foothills, through western portions of the Charlotte metro
area, into the northwest Piedmont of North Carolina. Ice
accumulation of one quarter to one half inch with light sleet
and snow accumulations are expected across much of the
remainder of the Carolina Piedmont, including much of
Charlotte and vicinity. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of upstate South Carolina, northeast Georgia
and the western Piedmont and foothills of North Carolina.
* WHEN...From midnight tonight to midnight EST Sunday night.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be nearly impossible across the entire
area. At least scattered power outages and tree damage are
likely across the Piedmont due to the ice as well as gusty
winds.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Precipitation will begin this evening and
will gradually change over to a wintry mix across much of the
region by Sunday morning, although mainly snow is expected
across the North Carolina foothills. A mix of all precipitation
types is expected closer to the I-85 corridor, while mostly
freezing rain is forecast for areas southeast of I-85. The
precipitation should taper off Sunday afternoon and evening,
perhaps as a period of light snow. Black ice could be a problem
each morning early next week.</description>
