<description>...TSUNAMI ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR ALL COASTS AND
BAYSHORES...
...TSUNAMI ADVISORY IS IN EFFECT FOR ALL COASTS AND
BAYSHORES...
* UPDATES... Tsunami energy continues to impact the Pacific coast
including the San Francisco bayshore line and Monterey Bay.
Several pulses of rapid water rises and outflows have been
observed and are expected to continue into tonight. We are
currently in low tide so there is limited risk of coastal
flooding. However, the strong currents from the rapid rises and
outflows are still capable of pulling people out to sea.
* LOCAL IMPACTs... For people in the advisory area...A tsunami
capable of producing strong currents that may be hazardous to
swimmers... boats...and coastal structures is expected. Low lying
shallow or channeled areas (such as harbors and marinas) should
expect continued minor to moderate flooding.
* RECOMMENDED ACTIONS...
If you are located in this coastal area...move off the beach
and out of harbors and marinas. Do not go to the coast to
watch the tsunami. Be alert to instructions from your local
emergency officials
* FORECAST TSUNAMI DURATION... No estimate at this time. The
Hawaiian Islands were under a tsunami advisory for approximately
11 hours but a longer duration for our area is possible. Thus,
expect water levels could decrease below tsunami advisory levels
later tonight.
* FORECAST PEAK TSUNAMI WAVE HEIGHTS... Rapid fluctuations of 1 to 2
feet above and below forecast levels every 30 to 60 minutes.
* OBSERVED TSUNAMI WAVE HEIGHTS FROM EARLIER...Rapid fluctuations of
1 to 3 feet above and below forecast levels every 30 to 60
minutes
* PRELIMINARY EARTHQUAKE INFORMATION... A volcanic eruption
occurred at 827 PM PST on Jan 14 2022, centered near the Tonga
Islands.
This product will be updated as new information becomes available.
