<description>...TSUNAMI ADVISORY IS IN EFFECT FOR ALL COASTS AND
BAYSHORES...
.An underwater volcano eruption near Tonga late yesterday has
generated at tsunami. A series of water level surges onto and off of
the coastline and bayshores is ongoing and expected to continue
through the remainder of the day and into the evening. The tsunami
has already resulted in rapid swings of up to 3 feet above to below
forecast tidal level, or roughly 6 feet change within 30 to 60
minute intervals. The arriving water will come in a surge, similar
to a tidal rise, but in a much shorter interval, and not as a
shorter period cresting surf or wave. The surge of water onto and
off of coastline can dislodge coastal objects, knock around buoyed
objects such as boats, and potentially overwhelm individuals on the
coast. Very strong currents and undertow are capable of knocking
over, overwhelming, and then pulling people out into the cold,
restless ocean where hypothermia or drowning are a possibility.
Mariners on embarked vessels already off the coast are advised to
remain away from the coast until the water levels return to normal
fluctuations.
...TSUNAMI ADVISORY IS IN EFFECT FOR ALL COASTS AND
BAYSHORES...
* UPDATES... The tsunami is ongoing and impacting the Pacific coast
and San Francisco bayshore line. Several pulses of rapid rises and
falls have been observed and are expected to continue.
* LOCAL IMPACTs... For people in the advisory area...A tsunami
capable of producing strong currents that may be hazardous to
swimmers... boats...and coastal structures is expected. Low lying
shallow, or channeled areas (such as harbors and shallow water
areas) should expect continued minor to moderate flooding. Several
area harbors have reported moderate flooding and damage and
further flooding is possible.
* RECOMMENDED ACTIONS...
If you are located in this coastal area...move off the beach
and out of harbors and marinas. Do not go to the coast to
watch the tsunami. Be alert to instructions from your local
emergency officials
* FORECAST TSUNAMI DURATION... No estimate at this. The Hawaiian
Islands were under a tsunami advisory for approximately 11 hours
but a longer duration for our area is possible. Thus, expect water
levels could decrease below tsunami advisory levels by this
evening.
* FORECAST PEAK TSUNAMI WAVE HEIGHTS... Rapid fluctuations of 1 to 3
feet above and below forecast levels every 30 to 60 minutes.
* OBSERVED TSUNAMI WAVE HEIGHTS FROM EARLIER...Rapid fluctuations of
1 to 3 feet above and below forecast levels every 30 to 60 minutes
* PRELIMINARY EARTHQUAKE INFORMATION... An volcanic eruption
occurred at 827 PM PST on Jan 14 2022, centered near the Tonga
Islands.
