Willamette Valley, Greater Portland Metro Area and Lower
Columbia.
* WHEN...For the Dense Fog Advisory, until noon PST today. For
the Air Stagnation Advisory, until noon PST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous driving conditions due to low visibility and
highly variable visibility over very short distances. Air
stagnation could result in the development and persistence of
poor air quality.</description>
<instruction>If driving, slow down, use low beam headlights, and leave plenty
of following distance ahead of you. Expect rapid changes in
visibility from nearly unlimited to less than a quarter mile over
very short distances.
People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with high levels of air pollution during
periods of stagnant air.
State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor
burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be
limited as much as possible. According to state air quality
agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants
close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with
your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
