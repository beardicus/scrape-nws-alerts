<instruction>Flooding is occurring or is imminent. Be aware of your surroundings
and do not drive on flooded roads. It is important to know where you
are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become killers
in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or creeks.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Remain alert for flooding even in locations not receiving rain.
Arroyos, streams, and rivers can become raging killer currents in a
matter of minutes, even from distant rainfall.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
