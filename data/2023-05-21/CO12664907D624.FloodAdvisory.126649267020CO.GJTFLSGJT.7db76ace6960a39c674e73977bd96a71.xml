* WHERE...Portions of western Colorado including, Dolores,
Montezuma, San Miguel and Montrose Counties.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 341 PM MDT, reports indicate areas of minor flooding are
ongoing or are expected to redevelop through early to

levels over the next couple days.
- River conditions and hazards may change rapidly. There may be
dangerous unreported hazards, including, but not limited to,
low overhanging bridges, and debris (logs and sticks) that
