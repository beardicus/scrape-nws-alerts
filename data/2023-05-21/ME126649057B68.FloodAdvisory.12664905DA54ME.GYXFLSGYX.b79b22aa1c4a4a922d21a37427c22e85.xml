<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 445 AM EDT EARLY THIS
MORNING...
* WHAT...Urban and poor-drainage flooding caused by excessive
rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of southwest Maine, including the following
counties, Androscoggin, Cumberland and York.
* WHEN...Until 445 AM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
Ponding of water especially in urban areas is occurring.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 157 AM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated moderate to heavy rain. This has likely caused
flooding of urban and other poorly-drained areas. Between 1.5
and 2.5 inches of rain have fallen with localized amounts of
2.5 to 3.0 inches since rain began yesterday afternoon.
- Rainfall is coming to an end early this morning. It will
likely take a few hours for ponding and other high water to
diminish with the potential for lingering impacts around
dawn.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Portland, Lewiston, South Portland, Auburn, Biddeford,
Brunswick, Westbrook, Kittery, Bath and Alfred.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
