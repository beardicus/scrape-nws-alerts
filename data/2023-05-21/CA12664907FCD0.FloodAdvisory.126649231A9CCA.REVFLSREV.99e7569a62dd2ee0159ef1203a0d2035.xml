<headline>Flood Advisory issued May 21 at 3:44PM PDT until further notice by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>.A thunderstorm has developed over the Tamarack burn scar. The
greatest risk for flooding is along Leviathan Mine Road and Spring
Valley areas. However, if you are anywhere near the burn scar, try
to get to higher ground and away from any potential areas that may
slide. An upgrade to a flash flood warning may be warranted if heavy
precipitation continues.
...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM PDT THIS AFTERNOON FOR AREAS
NEAR THE TAMARACK BURN SCAR...
* WHAT...Small stream flooding and possible mud slides caused by
excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Portions of east central California and western Nevada,
including the following counties, in east central California,
Alpine and Mono. In western Nevada, Douglas. Specifically, near
the Tamarack Burn Scar.
* WHEN...Until 500 PM PDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas. Mud
slides and debris flows are also possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 339 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms. This will cause small stream flooding. Between
0.5 and 1 inch of rain has fallen in the last hour.
- Leviathan Road and Spring Valley is the most likely place to
experience minor flooding.
Additional rainfall amounts of 0.5 to 1 inch are expected
over the area. This additional rain will result in minor
flooding.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Monitor Pass and Holbrook Junction.

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
A Flood Advisory for a recent burn area means that flooding and/or
debris flows are possible. Residents living in or immediately
downstream of burn areas should maintain awareness for potential
flooding and debris flows. Monitor conditions and emergency
management communications. If flooding and/or debris flows are
observed, move to a safe area away from the flooding.</instruction>
