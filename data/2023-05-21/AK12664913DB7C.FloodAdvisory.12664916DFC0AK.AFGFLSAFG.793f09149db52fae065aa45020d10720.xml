<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY FOR AN ICE JAM REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 PM AKDT
TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues.
* WHERE...Yukon River near From the Nowitna River downstream to
Nulato.
* WHEN...Until 300 PM AKDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying areas. Water over roads in
low lying areas. Fish camps and cabins in low lying areas could
see minor flooding. Ice could push onshore over low spots in the
river bank.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 411 PM AKDT, The public reported that the ice jam on Yukon
River near the Nowitna River released early Sunday morning,
and is moving downstream. High water and a heavy run of ice
is now moving past Galena, and will get to Koyukuk late this
afternoon or evening, and to Nulato this evening or late
tonight. Minor flooding is expected in most low lying areas
between the Nowitna and Nulato. The large amount of water
backed up behind this jam will take many days to drain so
water levels on the Yukon will remain high for a number of
days.
- The river is starting to crest in Galena. Flooding of low
lying areas and roads is occuring in Galena and some ice has
pushed onshore. Flooding in Galena is expected to be minor,
and no homes in Galena are expected to flood. Low lying areas
all along the Yukon River between the Nowitna River and
Nulato can expect minor flooding, including low lying
sections of Koyukuk and Nulato. Fish camps and cabins in low
lying areas could see minor flooding. Flooding is not
expected in Ruby due to its higher elevation above the river.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Nulato, Koyukuk and Galena.
- For Yukon River at Galena:
At 10:00am Sunday the stage was 122.0 feet.
Flood Stage is 124.0 feet.
- For Yukon River at Ruby:
