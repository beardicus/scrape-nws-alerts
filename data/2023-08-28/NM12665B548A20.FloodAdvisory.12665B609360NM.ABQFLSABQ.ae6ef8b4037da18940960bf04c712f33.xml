<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Do not camp along streams and rivers. Remain alert when hiking in
steep, narrow canyons. Know where you are relative to low spots and
drainages.
Remember, ditches are deadly. A gentle flow of water can become a
raging torrent in a few minutes.</instruction>
