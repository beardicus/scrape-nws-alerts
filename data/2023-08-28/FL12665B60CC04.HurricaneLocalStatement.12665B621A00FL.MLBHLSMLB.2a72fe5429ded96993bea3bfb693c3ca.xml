<description>This product covers East Central Florida
**Tropical Storm Idalia Near Western Cuba Remains Near Hurricane
Strength As It Continues Slowly Northward**
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- The Tropical Storm Watch has been upgraded to a Tropical Storm
Warning for all of Volusia and Brevard counties
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for all of Lake, Orange,
Osceola, Seminole, Volusia and Brevard counties
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 510 miles south-southwest of Leesburg FL
- 22.0N 85.0W
- Storm Intensity 70 mph
- Movement North or 10 degrees at 8 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
The center of Tropical Storm Idalia is located around 10 miles
northwest of the western tip of Cuba late this evening. Idalia
currently has maximum sustained winds of 70 mph and is moving north at
about 8 mph. A continued northward motion is expected tonight and
Tuesday. Idalia is forecast to cross the Florida Gulf coast late on
Wednesday as a major hurricane. Preparations should be ongoing for
local tropical storm conditions by Tuesday night and into Wednesday.
A Tropical Storm Warning remains in effect for Lake, Osceola, Orange
and Seminole counties. A Tropical Storm Warning is now in effect for
Volusia and Brevard counties. For the Atlantic waters, a Tropical
Storm Warning is now in effect north of Sebastian Inlet.
Showers and squalls associated with outer rain bands from Idalia
should reach central Florida on Tuesday, with conditions further
deteriorating Tuesday night and Wednesday as Idalia accelerates
north-northeastward across the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The possibility
of strong to damaging wind gusts in squalls will increase as tropical
storm force winds extend well eastward from the storm`s center. Based
on the current forecast track, Idalia will make its closest pass to
east-central Florida late Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning,
continuing northeastward during the day on Wednesday. Wednesday will
be a windy day even outside of squalls.
While the heaviest rainfall from Idalia is currently forecast to fall
along the Gulf Coast and western Florida Peninsula, gusty squalls will
be capable of torrential downpours, especially Tuesday and Wednesday.
One to two inches of rain from Monday afternoon through Wednesday
night is forecast for coastal areas and Okeechobee County, and two to
four inches is forecast west of I-95 from Brevard and Osceola Counties
northward, with locally higher amounts possible. Locations in closer
proximity to the center of Idalia, generally along and west of
Interstate Four in east-central Florida, may receive higher rainfall
totals.
In addition to strong wind gusts, a threat for tornadoes is forecast
to develop from Tuesday afternoon continuing into Wednesday.
Incoming Atlantic swell from Major Hurricane Franklin combined with
winds from Idalia will lead to high seas, rough surf, an increase in
life-threatening rip currents, and beach erosion during high tides
during Tuesday and Wednesday.
Do not let your guard down. Impacts from Idalia will be felt far from
the center of the storm. Now is the time to ensure your hurricane
supply kit is stocked and your safety plan is in place.
As Idalia becomes better organized through tonight, additional changes
to the current forecast are possible. Any eastward adjustments in the
forecast track would increase the potential for local impacts, so
continue to monitor the latest forecasts from the National Hurricane
Center and National Weather Service in Melbourne, Florida.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Protect against dangerous wind having possible significant impacts
across portions of east central Florida. Potential impacts in this
area include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible
significant impacts across portions of east central Florida.
Potential impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals, and
ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a dangerous tornado event having possible significant
impacts across portions of east central Florida. Potential impacts
include:
- The occurrence of scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- Several places may experience tornado damage with a few spots
of considerable damage, power loss, and communications failures.
- Locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses, mobile
homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees snapped or
uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed about.
Dangerous projectiles can add to the toll.
* SURGE:
Direct surge impacts from Idalia are not currently anticipated at
this time. However, larger swells and surf combined with Hurricane
Franklin will bring a threat for minor coastal flooding and beach
erosion. Locations more vulnerable to coastal flooding and beach
erosion, such as portions of the Volusia and Brevard county coast,
should stay updated on the latest forecasts.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local officials for recommended preparedness actions.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies
kit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your
home or business.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, and tornadoes extend well away from the center of the
storm.
When securing your property, outside preparations should be concluded
as soon as possible before conditions deteriorate. The onset of
strong gusty winds or flooding can cause certain preparedness
activities to become unsafe.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes
to the forecast.
There is a threat from tornadoes with this storm. Have multiple ways
to receive Tornado Warnings. Be ready to shelter quickly.
