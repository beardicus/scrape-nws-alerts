<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued August 28 at 5:36PM EDT until August 30 at 2:00PM EDT by NWS Key West</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 PM EDT WEDNESDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT IS CANCELLED...
* WHAT...Coastal flooding.
* WHERE...Middle Keys.
* WHEN...Until early Wednesday afternoon, but especially during
the morning high tides.
* IMPACTS...Saltwater flooding of low elevation streets and lots
is expected. Some storm drains will overflow, and some
seawalls and docks will be overtopped. Boaters can expect less
clearance under fixed bridges. Motorists should remember that
persistent puddles around the times of high tide are almost
certain to contain a mix of saltwater.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The combination of King tides and strong
southerly breezes, will result in coastal flooding across the
Middle Keys. Peak water levels will reach around 2 feet above
mean high tide, or about a foot higher than Monday morning`s
high tide.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
impassable. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
