<headline>Flood Watch issued August 28 at 5:46PM AKDT until August 29 at 12:00AM AKDT by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...The Upper Kobuk and Noatak Valleys and Upper Koyukuk
Valley from Bettles west.
* WHEN...Through Wednesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff from heavy rain may result in flooding
of smaller rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and
flood-prone locations. At this time, flooding of the mainstem of
the Koyukuk, Noatak and Kobuk Rivers is not expected, but those
rivers will see sharp rises this week with water overbank in some
low lying locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Between 2 to 4 inches of rain has fallen over the Upper
Noatak Valley, Kobuk Valley, and the Koyukuk Valley from the
Dalton Highway west. Another 0.5 inches of rain is expected
over these same areas through early Tuesday. Streams and
smaller rivers in these basins are already running high, and
the additional rain could push them overbank over the next
several days. Flooding of low lying areas is possible through
Wednesday.

Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
