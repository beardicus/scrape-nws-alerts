SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Idalia remains just of the Yucatan Coast tonight. Idalia
is forecast to move to the north and then northeast into the eastern
Gulf of Mexico. The storm is currently forecast to impact the
southwestern waters of the Florida Keys tomorrow night and spread
northeast and east and spread to the Gulf waters through Wednesday.
Other impacts to the Florida Keys will continue overnight into
Wednesday, including damaging wind gusts of 50 to 55 mph, with the
strongest winds in the Lower Keys, additional rainfall of 1 to 3
inches, and the potential for isolated tornadoes.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across the
Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* SURGE:
Storm surge of 1 to 2 feet are expected across the Lower Keys.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across the Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.
- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually
vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding of water
occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become
near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge
closures.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
Always heed the advice of local officials and comply with orders that
are issued.
