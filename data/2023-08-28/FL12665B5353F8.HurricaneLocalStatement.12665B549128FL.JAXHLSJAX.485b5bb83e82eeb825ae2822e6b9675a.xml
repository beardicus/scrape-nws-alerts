SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Idalia is forecast to track northward into the
southeast Gulf of Mexico tonight. Idalia is forecast to strengthen
to Hurricane intensity this evening, and rapid strengthening is possible
as the Idalia accelerates north-northeastward towards the Florida Big Bend
or Nature Coasts on Tuesday afternoon and night. Idalia is expected to
make landfall at Category 3 hurricane strength Wednesday morning, and the
hurricane should then turn northeastward as it accelerates across our area on
Wednesday.
Local impacts from Idalia will begin on Tuesday afternoon and evening,
as spiral rain bands begin to overspread our region from southwest to
northeast. Heavy rainfall will then continue through the day
Wednesday. Tornadoes will be possible across the area on Tuesday night
and Wednesday, with higher chances along and to the east and southeast
of the Idalia`s center. Sustained tropical storm force winds will begin
to be felt across north central Florida and the Suwannee Valley during
the overnight or predawn hours on Wednesday, with conditions deteriorating
quickly towards sunrise, when hurricane force wind gusts will be
possible. Sustained tropical storm force winds and occasional
hurricane force wind gusts are possible. The core of the storm is forecast
to move offshore Wednesday evening. Storm surge potential will increase on
Wednesday, especially along the southeast Georgia coast, where life
threatening inundation of greater than 3 feet above ground level is
possible.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for life-threatening wind having possible devastating impacts
across along and west of I-75 in bortheast Florida. Potential impacts in this area
include:
- Structural damage to sturdy buildings, some with complete roof
and wall failures. Complete destruction of mobile homes. Damage
greatly accentuated by large airborne projectiles. Locations
may be uninhabitable for weeks or months.
- Numerous large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and
roadway signs blown over.
- Many roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. Many bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Widespread power and communications outages.
Also, prepare for life-threatening wind having possible significant
to extensive impacts across the rest of northeast Florida and southeast Georgia.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a dangerous tornado event having possible significant
impacts across northeast Florida. Potential impacts
include:
- The occurrence of scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- Several places may experience tornado damage with a few spots
of considerable damage, power loss, and communications failures.
- Locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses, mobile
homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees snapped or
uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed about.
Dangerous projectiles can add to the toll.
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across southeast Georgia.
* SURGE:
Prepare for life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across coastal southeast Georgia. Potential impacts in
this area include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
Also, prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across coastal northeast Florida and the St. Johns River.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across northeast Florida and southeast Georgia. Potential
impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may
become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and barriers may
become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.
Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with
underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.
Many road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions, including
possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so immediately.
For those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind, falling trees,
and flooding at your location. If you decide to move, relocate to a safer
location nearby. If you do not relocate, help keep roadways open for those
under evacuation
orders.
If evacuating, leave with a destination in mind and allow extra time to get
there. Take your emergency supplies kit. Gas up your vehicle ahead of time.
Let others know where you are going prior to departure. Secure loose items
and pets in the car, and avoid distracted driving.
If evacuating, follow designated evacuation routes. Seek traffic information
on roadway signs, the radio, and from official sources.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies
kit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your
home or business.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
If in a place that is vulnerable to high wind, such as near large
trees, a manufactured home, upper floors of a high-rise building, or
on a boat, plan to move to safe shelter.
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
near the ocean or a large inland lake, in a low-lying or poor
drainage area, plan to move to safe shelter on higher ground.
Always heed the advice of local officials and comply with orders that
are issued. Do not needlessly jeopardize your life or the lives of
others.
When securing your property, outside preparations should be concluded
as soon as possible before conditions deteriorate. The onset of
strong gusty winds or flooding can cause certain preparedness
activities to become unsafe.
Be sure to let friends and family members know of your intentions for
weathering the storm and your whereabouts. Have someone located away
from the threatened area serve as your point of contact. Share vital
contact information with others. Keep cell phones handy and charged.
Check on those who may not be fully aware of the situation or who are
unable to make personal preparations.
If you are a visitor, know the name of the county in which
you are located and where it is relative to current watches and
warnings. If staying at a hotel, ask the management staff about their
onsite disaster plan. Listen for evacuation orders, especially
pertaining to area visitors.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes
to the forecast.
There is a threat from tornadoes with this storm. Have multiple ways
to receive Tornado Warnings. Be ready to shelter quickly.
