<instruction>If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.
Torrential rainfall is also occurring with these storms and may lead
to localized flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flooded
roadways.
The rain may intensify or persist, so be certain to monitor local
radio stations and available television stations for additional
information and possible warnings from the National Weather Service.
Excessive runoff from heavy rainfall will cause elevated levels on
small creeks and streams, and ponding of water in urban areas,
highways, streets and underpasses, as well as other poor drainage
areas and low lying spots. In hilly terrain there are hundreds of
low water crossings which are potentially dangerous in heavy rain.
Do not attempt to travel across flooded roads. Find alternate routes
or move to higher ground.. The water depth may be too great to allow
your car to cross safely. It takes only a few inches of swiftly
flowing water to carry vehicles away.</instruction>
