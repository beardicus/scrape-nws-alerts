<headline>Rip Current Statement issued August 28 at 8:06PM EDT until August 29 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM EDT TUESDAY
THROUGH TUESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Dangerous rip currents expected.
* WHERE...Southwest Suffolk and Southeast Suffolk Counties.
* WHEN...From 6 AM EDT Tuesday through Tuesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Life-threatening rip currents are likely for all
people entering the surf zone. Anyone visiting the beaches
should stay out of the surf. Rip currents can sweep even the
best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The high rip current risk will continue
through Thursday due to a long period swell from distant
Hurricane Franklin.</description>
<instruction>If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
