SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Idalia is forecast to track northward into the
southeast Gulf of Mexico on Monday night. Idalia is forecast to
strengthen to Hurricane intensity on Monday afternoon, and rapid
strengthening is expected as the Idalia accelerates north-
northeastward towards the Florida Big Bend or Nature Coasts on
Tuesday afternoon and night. Idalia is expected to make landfall at
Category 3 hurricane strength early on Wednesday morning, and the
hurricane should then turn northeastward as it accelerates across
our area on Wednesday. Idalia could maintain hurricane intensity as it
reaches the Atlantic waters adjacent to Camden and Glynn Counties in
coastal southeast Georgia on Wednesday afternoon or evening.
Local impacts from Idalia will begin on Tuesday afternoon and
evening, as spiral rain bands begin to overspread our region from
southwest to northeast. Heavy rainfall will then continue through
the day Wednesday. Tornadoes will be possible across the area on
Tuesday night and Wednesday, with higher chances along and east of
the Idalia`s eye. Sustained tropical storm force winds will begin to
be felt across north central Florida and the Suwannee Valley during
the overnight or predawn hours on Wednesday, with conditions
deteriorating quickly towards sunrise, when hurricane force wind
gusts will be possible. Sustained tropical storm force winds and
occasional hurricane force wind gusts The core of the hurricane
force winds are forecast to move offshore of coastal southeast
Georgia by early Wednesday evening. Storm surge potential will
increase on Wednesday, especially along the southeast Georgia coast,
where life threatening inundation of greater than 3 feet above
ground level is possible.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for life-threatening wind having possible extensive impacts
across portions of north central Florida and the Suwannee Valley of
north Florida.
Potential impacts in this area include:
- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some having
window, door, and garage door failures leading to structural
damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed.
Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Locations may be
uninhabitable for weeks.
- Many large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and
roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. Several bridges, causeways, and
access routes impassable.
- Large areas with power and communications outages.
Also, prepare for dangerous wind having possible significant impacts across
southeast Georgia and the rest of northeast Florida.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across southeast Georgia, northeast and north central
Florida.
Potential impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may
become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and barriers may
become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.
Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with
underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.
Many road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
Prepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant
impacts across southeast Georgia, northeast and north central Florida.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a dangerous tornado event having possible significant
impacts across north central Florida and the Suwannee Valley of
north Florida.
Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- Several places may experience tornado damage with a few spots
of considerable damage, power loss, and communications failures.
- Locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses, mobile
homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees snapped or
uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed about.
Dangerous projectiles can add to the toll.
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
portions of southeast Georgia and northeast Florida.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
For those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,
falling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move,
relocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help keep
roadways open for those under evacuation orders.
If evacuating, leave with a destination in mind and allow extra time
to get there. Take your emergency supplies kit. Gas up your vehicle
ahead of time.
Let others know where you are going prior to departure. Secure loose
items and pets in the car, and avoid distracted driving.
If evacuating, follow designated evacuation routes. Seek traffic
information on roadway signs, the radio, and from official sources.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies
kit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your
home or business.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
If in a place that is vulnerable to high wind, such as near large
trees, a manufactured home, upper floors of a high-rise building, or
on a boat, plan to move to safe shelter.
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
near the ocean or a large inland lake, in a low-lying or poor
drainage area, in a valley, or near an already swollen river, plan to
move to safe shelter on higher ground.
Always heed the advice of local officials and comply with orders that
are issued. Do not needlessly jeopardize your life or the lives of
others.
When securing your property, outside preparations should be concluded
as soon as possible before conditions deteriorate. The onset of
strong gusty winds or flooding can cause certain preparedness
activities to become unsafe.
Be sure to let friends and family members know of your intentions for
weathering the storm and your whereabouts. Have someone located away
from the threatened area serve as your point of contact. Share vital
contact information with others. Keep cell phones handy and charged.
Check on those who may not be fully aware of the situation or who are
unable to make personal preparations.
If you are a visitor, know the name of the county or parish in which
you are located and where it is relative to current watches and
warnings. If staying at a hotel, ask the management staff about their
onsite disaster plan. Listen for evacuation orders, especially
pertaining to area visitors.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes
to the forecast.
There is a threat from tornadoes with this storm. Have multiple ways
to receive Tornado Warnings. Be ready to shelter quickly.
