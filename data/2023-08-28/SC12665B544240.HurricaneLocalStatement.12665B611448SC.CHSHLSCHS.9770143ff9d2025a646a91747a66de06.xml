SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Idalia is expected to track into the southeast Gulf
of Mexico while strengthening to Hurricane intensity this evening.
Further strengthening is possible as Idalia moves north-northeastward
toward the Florida Big Bend on Tuesday and Tuesday night, making
landfall as a major Hurricane Wednesday morning. Idalia will then turn
northeastward and accelerate across southeast Georgia and southeast
South Carolina Wednesday afternoon through Wednesday night.
Local impacts from Idalia will begin Wednesday morning as heavy
rainfall begins to overspread southeast Georgia and southeast South
Carolina from southwest to northeast. Heavy rainfall will then
continue through Wednesday night across the region with 4 to 8 inches
of rainfall forecast. Sustained tropical storm force winds of 40 to
50 mph will begin to be felt across the southeast Georgia coast on
Wednesday morning with conditions deteriorating Wednesday afternoon
where occasional hurricane force wind gusts are possible along the
southeast Georgia coast. Sustained tropical storm force winds will
develop along the southeast South Carolina coast Wednesday afternoon
and persist through Wednesday night. Tornadoes will be possible across
the area Wednesday afternoon and Wednesday night, particularly along
the coast and waterspouts across the coastal waters. Finally, there is
the potential for storm surge Wednesday afternoon through Wednesday
night along the southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina coasts,
where inundation up to 4 feet above ground level is possible.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across southeast South Carolina and southeast
Georgia. Potential impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding could prompt many rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries could rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple locations. Small streams, creeks, canals, ditches may
become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and barriers
could become stressed.
- Flood waters could enter many structures within multiple
communities; some structures become uninhabitable or are washed
away. Flood waters could cover multiple escape routes. Streets
and parking lots become rivers of moving water with underpasses
submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous. Many road and
bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
- Drinking water and sewer services could be negatively impacted.
- Hazardous containers and materials could possibly be present in
flood waters.
* SURGE:
Prepare for life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across coastal areas of southeast Georgia and southeast South
Carolina. Potential impacts in these areas include:
- Areas of inundation of saltwater along immediate shorelines and
in low-lying spots farther inland near rivers and creeks, with
storm surge flooding accentuated by waves. Damage to several
buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in normally vulnerable low
spots.
- Moderate to major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching
dunes. Strong and numerous rip currents.
- Minor to moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and
piers. Several small craft broken away from moorings,
especially in unprotected anchorages. Some navigation aids
possibly displaced well off station, creating difficult
navigation near inlets and waterways.
Elsewhere across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia,
little to no impact is anticipated.
* WIND:
Prepare for life-threatening wind having possible extensive impacts
across southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina, particularly
along the coast. Potential impacts in these areas include:
- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some window,
door, and garage door failures leading to structural damage.
Mobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed. Damage
accentuated by airborne projectiles. Some locations may be
uninhabitable for weeks.
- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne
projectiles outside.
- Large trees snapped or uprooted.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and access routes
impassable.
- Large areas with power and communications outages, which could
persist for days.
- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia. Potential impacts
include:
- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency plans.
- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along with
power and communications disruptions.
- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees, vehicles,
boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and other poorly
constructed structures.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
WATCH/WARNING PHASE - Listen to local official for recommended
preparedness actions, including possible evacuation. If ordered to
evacuate, do so immediately.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies
kit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your
home or business.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
