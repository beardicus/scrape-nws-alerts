...TROPICAL STORM IDALIA CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN AS IT MOVES SLOWLY
NORTHWARD IN THE FAR NORTHWESTERN CARIBBEAN SEA...
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Monroe Lower Keys
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 380 miles southwest of Key West FL
- 20.1N 85.2W
- Storm Intensity 65 mph
- Movement North or 360 degrees at 7 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Idalia continues to steadily gather strength as it
has begun to move slowly northward toward the Yucatan Channel. There
has been no changes in watches and warnings, with a Tropical Storm
Warning remaining in effect for Dry Tortugas and a Tropical Storm
Watch in effect for the Lower Florida Keys. Idalia is expected to
accelerate northward later today and north northeastward through
tomorrow. Idalia is expected to remain well west of the Florida Keys as
it passes to our north. However, Idalia is expected to be a large
system and is expected to affect the Keys. Expect winds to gradually
strengthen over the next 24 to 36 hours, peaking Tuesday afternoon.
The strongest impacts will be experienced across the western portion of
the forecast area. Tropical Storm-force wind gusts will be possible
particularly in the Lower Keys. This along with spring tides may result
in coastal flooding of 1 to 2 feet. In addition, rainfall of 1 to 3
inches, with locally higher amounts, and isolated tornadoes will be
possible. Conditions are expected to gradually improve Tuesday night
into Wednesday.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across the
Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* SURGE:
Prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited impacts
across the Lower Keys. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of roads and parking lots inundated by surge water.
Driving conditions dangerous in places where surge water covers
the road.
- Moderate beach erosion.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
Elsewhere across the Florida Keys, little to no impact is anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across the Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.
- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually
vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding of water
occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become
near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge
closures.
* TORNADOES:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time across the Florida
Keys.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as in
a low-lying or poor drainage area, plan to move to safe shelter on
higher ground.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news outlets
for official storm information. Listen for possible changes to the
forecast.
