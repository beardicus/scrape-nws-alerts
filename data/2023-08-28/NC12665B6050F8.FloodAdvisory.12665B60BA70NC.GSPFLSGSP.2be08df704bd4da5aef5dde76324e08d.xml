developed over east-central Iredell County between

inches of rainfall over portions of Iredell County and may
impact the Statesville metro area as well over the next hour.
This rainfall will cause significant rises on small streams
with some streams exceeding bankfull.  Nuisance to Minor
flooding associated with these storms is imminent from
Hiddenite to Scotts to Statesville and Cool Springs with new
areas of flooding possible over the next 1-2 hours.
The current areas of greatest concern currently across
eastern Alexander County near and east of Hiddenite,
including near Sharpe Mill Rd, Cheatham Ford Rd, Damascus
Church Rd, and Pisgah Church Rd.  Expect new areas of
flooding to develop further east into Iredell County through
10pm.
- Additional rainfall of 1-2 inches is possible over the next
60-90 minutes.  A Flash Flood Warning may be needed if
ongoing storms do not dissipate quickly enough  Please stay
