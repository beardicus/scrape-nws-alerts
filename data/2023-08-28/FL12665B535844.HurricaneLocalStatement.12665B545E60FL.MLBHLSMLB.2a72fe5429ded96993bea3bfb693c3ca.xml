SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
The center of Tropical Storm Idalia is located around 70 miles
south of the tip of western Cuba late this morning. A continued
northward motion expected today and Tuesday. Idalia remains forecast
to approach the Florida Gulf coast late Tuesday and
early Wednesday as a major hurricane. Preparations should be ongoing
for local tropical storm conditions by Tuesday night and into
Wednesday.
A Tropical Storm Warning is now in effect for Lake county. A Tropical
Storm watch is now in effect for Seminole, Orange, Volusia, Osceola
and Brevard Counties. For the Atlantic waters, a Tropical Storm Watch
is now in effect north of Sebastian Inlet.
Showers and squalls associated with outer rain bands from Idalia
should begin to reach central Florida by Tuesday morning, with
conditions further deteriorating during Tuesday as Idalia accelerates
north-northeastward across the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The possibility
of strong to damaging wind gusts in squalls will increase as tropical
storm force winds extend well eastward from the storm`s center,
potentially reaching interior portions of east-central Florida Tuesday
night into Wednesday morning. Based on the current forecast track,
Idalia will make its closest pass to east-central Florida late Tuesday
night and early Wednesday morning, continuing northeastward during the
day on Wednesday.
While the heaviest rainfall from Idalia is currently forecast to fall
along the Gulf Coast and western Florida Peninsula, gusty squalls will
be capable of torrential downpours, especially Tuesday and Wednesday.
One to two inches of rain from Monday afternoon through Wednesday
night is forecast for coastal areas and Okeechobee County, and two to
four inches is forecast west of I-95 from Brevard and Osceola Counties
northward, with locally higher amounts possible. Locations in closer
proximity to the center of Idalia, generally along and west of
Interstate Four in east-central Florida, may receive higher rainfall
totals.
In addition to strong wind gusts, a threat for tornadoes is forecast
to develop from Tuesday afternoon continuing into Wednesday.
Incoming Atlantic swell from Major Hurricane Franklin combined with
winds from Idalia will lead to high seas, rough surf, an increase in
life-threatening rip currents, and beach erosion during high tides
during Tuesday and Wednesday.
Do not let your guard down. Impacts from Idalia will be felt far from
the center of the storm. Now is the time to ensure your hurricane
supply kit is stocked and your safety plan is in place.
As Idalia becomes better organized through tonight, additional changes
to the current forecast are possible. Any eastward adjustments in the
forecast track would increase the potential for local impacts, so
continue to monitor the latest forecasts from the National Hurricane
Center and National Weather Service in Melbourne, Florida.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for dangerous wind having possible significant impacts across
. Portions of east central Florida. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
* SURGE: Direct surge impacts from Idalia are not currently
anticipated at this time. However, larger swells and surf combined
with Hurricane Franklin will bring a threat for minor coastal
flooding and beach erosion. Locations more vulnerable to coastal
flooding and beach erosion, such as portions of the Volusia and
Brevard county coast, should stay updated on the latest forecasts.
* FLOODING RAIN: Prepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant
impacts across portions of east central FLorida. Potential impacts
include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals, and
ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
* TORNADOES: Prepare for a dangerous tornado event having possible significant
impacts across east central Florida. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- Several places may experience tornado damage with a few spots
of considerable damage, power loss, and communications failures.
- Locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses, mobile
homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees snapped or
uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed about.
Dangerous projectiles can add to the toll.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS: Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so immediately.
For those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,
falling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move,
relocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help keep
roadways open.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION: Now is the time to check your emergency
plan and emergency supplies kit and take necessary actions to protect your
family and secure your home or business.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
When securing your property, outside preparations should be concluded
as soon as possible before conditions deteriorate. The onset of
strong gusty winds or flooding can cause certain preparedness
activities to become unsafe.
Check on those who may not be fully aware of the situation or who are
unable to make personal preparations.
If you are a visitor, know the name of the county or parish in which
you are located and where it is relative to current watches and
warnings. If staying at a hotel, ask the management staff about their
onsite disaster plan. Listen for evacuation orders, especially
pertaining to area visitors.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes
to the forecast.
There is a threat from tornadoes with this storm. Have multiple ways
to receive Tornado Warnings. Be ready to shelter quickly.
NEXT UPDATE

The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather
Service in Melbourne FL around 6 PM EDT, or sooner if conditions
warrant.</description>
