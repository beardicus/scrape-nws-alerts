<headline>High Surf Advisory issued August 28 at 8:40PM EDT until August 30 at 8:00AM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM TUESDAY TO 8 AM
EDT WEDNESDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM EDT TUESDAY
THROUGH TUESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 6 to
9 feet expected in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards
Statement, dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Hatteras Island beaches, and Core Banks beaches.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, from 6 AM Tuesday to 8 AM
EDT Wednesday. For the Beach Hazards Statement, from 8 AM EDT
Tuesday through Tuesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Localized ocean overwash will be
possible between Oregon Inlet and Cape Lookout, and may impact
portions of NC-12 during times of high tide. Rip currents can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most likely time for strong rip
currents to occur is a couple hours either side of low tide,
which will occur around 6 PM Monday.</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
