**TROPICAL STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR THE LOWER KEYS**
NEW INFORMATION

* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Monroe Lower Keys
* STORM INFORMATION:

SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Idalia continues to strengthen near the western tip
of Cuba. There have been no changes to the watches and warnings,
with a Tropical Storm Warning in effect for the Dry Tortugas and a
Tropical Storm Watch in effect for the Lower Keys. Idalia will
continue to the north overnight, then accelerate to the north to
northeast on Tuesday and Wednesday. The confidence in the track
forecast is quite high for the next 24 hours as it treks northward,
followed by some uncertainty regarding when the system will turn
northeastward towards Florida`s the Big Bend region. At its closest
point of approach, the center of Idalia will pass well to the west
of the Florida Keys during the day on Tuesday. Winds will continue
to strengthen gradually over the next 12 to 24 hours, peaking
Tuesday afternoon. Tropical Storm-force wind gusts will be possible,
particularly along and west of the Lower Keys, and during
occasional thundery squalls. The persistent southerly winds, along
with King tides, may result in coastal flooding of 2 feet above normal
high tides. In addition, rainfall of 1 to 3 inches, with locally higher
amounts, and a tornado or two cannot be ruled out. Conditions are
expected to gradually improve Tuesday night into Wednesday, although
strong southerly breezes will persist through much of the day on
Wednesday.
No evacuations are in place.  Monroe County and City of Key West
report facilities and services will remain open. Medical services
and The Key West International Airport will remain open. For further

POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across the
Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes is possible. Unsecured lightweight objects blown
about.
- Some large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* SURGE:
Prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited impacts
across the Florida Keys. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of roads and parking lots inundated by surge water.
Driving conditions dangerous in places where surge water covers
the road.
- Moderate beach erosion.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers are possible. A few small craft may break away from
moorings.
Elsewhere across the Florida Keys, little to no impact is anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across the Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- Localized rainfall flooding possible, mainly on secondary
roadways.
- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually
vulnerable spots.
* TORNADOES:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time across the Florida
Keys.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
If you are exceptionally vulnerable to wind or water hazards from
tropical systems, consider voluntary evacuation, especially if being
officially recommended. Relocate to a predetermined shelter or safe
destination.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging wind
gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the center of
the storm.
When securing your property, outside preparations should be concluded
as soon as possible before conditions deteriorate. The onset of strong
gusty winds or flooding can cause certain preparedness activities to
become unsafe.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news outlets
for official storm information. Listen for possible changes to the
forecast.
