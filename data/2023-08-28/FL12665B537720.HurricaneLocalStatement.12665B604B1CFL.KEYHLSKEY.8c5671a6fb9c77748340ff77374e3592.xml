**TROPICAL STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR THE LOWER KEYS**
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Monroe Lower Keys
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 340 miles southwest of Key West FL
- 20.8N 85.2W
- Storm Intensity 65 mph
- Movement North or 360 degrees at 8 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Idalia continues to strengthen just southwest of the
western tip of Cuba. Air Force and NOAA reconnaissance aircraft will
sample the storm environment through early afternoon, which will
provide valuable information on Idalia`s structure and intensity.
There have been no changes to the watches and warnings, with a
Tropical Storm Warning in effect for the Dry Tortugas and a Tropical
Storm Watch in effect for the Lower Keys. Idalia will continue to the
north today and tonight, then accelerate to the north to northeast on
Tuesday and Wednesday. The confidence in the track forecast is high for
the next 24 to 36-hours, followed by more spread and lower confidence
in the track as Idalia nears the Gulf Coast. Idalia will pass well to
the west of the Florida Keys Tuesday morning and Tuesday afternoon.
In fact, based on the latest National Hurricane Center forecast,
Idalia will pass more than 100 NM west of the Dry Tortugas. We expect
winds to strengthen gradually over the next 24-hours, peaking Tuesday
afternoon. Tropical Storm- force wind gusts will be likely,
particularly in the Lower Keys and during occasional, thundery squalls.
The persistent southerly winds, along with King tides, may result in
coastal flooding up to 2 feet above normal high tides. In addition,
rainfall of 1 to 3 inches, with locally higher amounts, and a tornado
or two cannot be ruled out. Conditions are expected to gradually
improve Tuesday night into Wednesday, although strong southerly breezes
will persist for much of Wednesday.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across the
Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Isolated power and communications outages.
* SURGE:
Prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited impacts
across the Lower Keys. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of roads and parking lots inundated by surge water.
Driving conditions dangerous in places where surge water covers
the road.
- Moderate beach erosion.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
Elsewhere across the Florida Keys, little to no impact is anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across the Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.
- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually
vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding of water
occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become
near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge
closures.
* TORNADOES:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time across the Florida
Keys.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
WATCH/WARNING PHASE - If you are exceptionally vulnerable to wind or
water hazards from tropical systems, consider voluntary evacuation,
especially if being officially recommended. Relocate to a safe
destination.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging wind
gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the center of
the storm.
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
in a low-lying or poor drainage area, plan to move to safe shelter on
higher ground.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes
to the forecast.
