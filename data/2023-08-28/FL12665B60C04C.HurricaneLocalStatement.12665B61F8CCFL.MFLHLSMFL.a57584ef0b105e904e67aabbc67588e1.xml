**Tropical Storm Idalia Continues to Strengthen**
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning and Storm Surge Watch are in effect
for Coastal Collier County
- A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Inland Collier County
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 400 miles southwest of Miami FL or about 350 miles
southwest of Naples FL
- 22.0N 85.0W
- Storm Intensity 70 mph
- Movement North or 10 degrees at 8 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Idalia continues to strengthen in the Yucatan
Channel this evening. The storm is forecast to move into the southeast
Gulf of Mexico overnight into Tuesday. Idalia is forecast to keep
strengthening over the eastern Gulf as it moves closer to the west
coast of Florida.
The following are the primary hazards of concern with Idalia:
* Coastal Flooding/Surge - Higher than usual tides due to the
combination of surge from Idalia and the full moon could lead to
coastal flooding of 2 to 4 feet in coastal Collier county and 1 to
3 feet along the coast of mainland Monroe County. Other vulnerable
coastal areas of southern Florida could also experience minor coastal
flooding, especially around the times of high tide.
* Rainfall - The majority of the rainfall associated with the system
is forecast to fall through Wednesday. The greatest risk for flash
flooding will be near the Gulf coast. Storm total rain amounts of 2 to
3 inches with localized higher amounts. The highest amounts are
anticipated along the Gulf coast.
* Wind - Increasingly gusty winds are forecast Tuesday through
Thursday, particularly along the Gulf coast and adjacent coastal
waters. A reasonable worst case scenario would have tropical storm
force winds across Collier County between Tuesday morning and
Wednesday. Areas of the East Coast and Atlantic waters could also see
gusty winds up to 35 mph during the same time frame.
* Tornadoes - A low-end tornado threat is possible through early
Thursday as banding from the system moves ashore. The focus for
tornadic activity could be in the western half of southern Florida.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
Southwest Florida. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact is anticipated.
* SURGE:
Protect against life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across coastal Collier County. Potential impacts in
this area include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
Also, protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across coastal portions of Mainland Monroe County.
Elsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact is anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible
significant impacts across Southwest Florida. Potential
impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Ditches and canals may quickly become swollen with swift
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
Protect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across the rest of South Florida.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts
across South Florida. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, mobile
homes pushed off foundations or overturned, large tree tops and
branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving
vehicles blown off roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.
Elsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions, including
possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so immediately.
For those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind, falling
trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move, relocate to
a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help keep roadways open
for those under evacuation orders.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
Keep cell phones well charged. Cell phone chargers for automobiles
can be helpful, but be aware of your risk for deadly carbon monoxide
poisoning if your car is left idling in a garage or other poorly
ventilated area.
If you are a visitor, be sure to know the name of the city or town in
which you are staying and the name of the county or parish in which
it resides. Listen for these locations in local news updates. Pay
attention for instructions from local authorities.
Storm surge is the leading killer associated with tropical storms and
hurricanes! Make sure you are in a safe area away from the surge
zone. Even if you are not in a surge-prone area, you could find
yourself cutoff by flood waters during and after the storm. Heed
evacuation orders issued by the local authorities.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
