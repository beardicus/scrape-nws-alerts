dangers of flooding.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.

enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.
