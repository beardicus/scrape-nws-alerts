<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 28 at 11:29PM EDT until August 29 at 3:00AM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 AM EDT TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...A portion of piedmont North Carolina, including the
following counties, Davie and Rowan.
* WHEN...Until 300 AM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks, greenways,
boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and parking lots.
Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.  A few flood-
prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1118 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicates that the heavy rain
responsible for rapid rises on area streams, including Fourth
Creek, Beaverdam Branch, and Third Creek, has ended.  Storm-
total rainfall of 2-3 inches of rain fell in less than 2
hours this evening, resulting in nuisance flooding in low-
lying areas adjacent to streams across the Advisory area.
Light to moderate rainfall will persist over the next hour
before gradually dissipating.  However, it will take at least
a couple more hours for area streams to crest and a few more
hours for larger streams, including Fourth Creek, to fall
back below bankfull.  Therefore, a nuisance flood threat will
persist into the overnight hours.  Please stay away from all
area streams and avoid any flooded roadways, which can be
very difficult to see at night.
Areas under the greatest threat for continued flooding
include near Mt Vernon Rd, Hart Rd, Cool Springs Rd, Carlson
Rd, S River Church Rd, and Powell Rd.
- Additional heavy rainfall is possible later tonight.  Given
saturated soils, any new periods of heavy rainfall may cause
new flood concerns to develop quickly.  Please stay weather
aware and be prepared to seek higher ground if you are in an
area vulnerable to flooding.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Cooleemee, Cleveland and Woodleaf.

<instruction>Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.</instruction>
