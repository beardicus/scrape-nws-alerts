County**
NEW INFORMATION

* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Storm Surge Watch and Tropical Storm Watch are in effect for
Coastal Collier County
- A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Inland Collier County
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 500 miles southwest of Miami FL or about 470 miles

SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Idalia is forecast to move into the southeast Gulf of
Mexico later today and into Tuesday. Idalia is forecast to gain strength
over the eastern Gulf as it moves closer to Florida.
The following are the primary hazards of concern with Ten/Idalia:
* Coastal Flooding/Surge - Higher than usual tides due to the
combination of surge from Idalia and the full moon could lead to minor
coastal flooding in vulnerable, low-lying coastal areas.
* Rainfall - The majority of the rainfall associated with the system
is forecast to fall from this afternoon through Wednesday. The greatest
risk for flash flooding will be near the Gulf coast. Storm total rain
amounts of 2-3 inches with localized higher amounts. The highest
amounts are anticipated along the Gulf coast.
* Wind - Increasingly gusty winds are forecast Tuesday through
Thursday, particularly along the Gulf coast and adjacent coastal
waters.
* Tornadoes - A low-end tornado threat is possible through early
Thursday as banding from the system moves ashore.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Prepare for life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across coastal Collier County. Potential impacts in this area
include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
Also, prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across coastal mainland Monroe county.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across South Florida. Potential impacts include:
- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.
- Ditches and canals may quickly rise with swift currents.
- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually
vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding of water
occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become
near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge
closures.
* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
areas of South Florida west of Lake Okeechobee. Potential impacts in
this area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Some large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact is anticipated.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
South Florida. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, mobile
homes pushed off foundations or overturned, large tree tops and
branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving
vehicles blown off roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.
Elsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies
kit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your
home or business.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
Always heed the advice of local officials and comply with orders that
are issued. Do not needlessly jeopardize your life or the lives of
others.
