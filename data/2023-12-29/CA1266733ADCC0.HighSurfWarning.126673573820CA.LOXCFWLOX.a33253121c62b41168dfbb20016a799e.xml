<headline>High Surf Warning issued December 29 at 12:16PM PST until December 30 at 10:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST SATURDAY...
...HIGH SURF WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, significant coastal
flooding expected. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking
waves of 10 to 15 feet with local sets to 18 feet along with
dangerous rip currents. Local sets 15 to 20 feet will be likely
across west-facing beaches near Point Conception.
* WHERE...Santa Barbara County Southwestern Coast and Santa
Barbara County Southeastern Coast.
* WHEN...Until 10 PM PST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Significant flooding of sea water is likely over
vulnerable low-lying coastal areas around the time of high tide.
Damage to coastal roadways and structures is possible. Powerful
waves and strong rip currents will pose an exceptional risk of
ocean drowning and possible damage to coastal structures like
piers and jetties. Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash
people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near
shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Each morning through Saturday, residual
high tides of 6.0 to 6.5 feet will enhance the coastal
flooding risk.</description>
<instruction>Stay off of beaches and coastal walkways, roads, and structures.
Do NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other water side
infrastructure.</instruction>
