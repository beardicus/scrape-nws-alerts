<senderName>NWS Monterey (The San Francisco area)</senderName>
<headline>Flood Watch issued January 04 at 9:11PM PST  by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>.A potent storm system associated atmospheric river will continue to
impact the region through early Thursday, bringing substantial
rainfall to the San Francisco Bay Area and Central Coast on top of
already saturated soils. Showers and isolated thunderstorms will
then bring periods of heavy rain to the region as well on Thursday.
As a result, rapid rises will occur along area creeks, streams, and
rivers.  Several streams and creeks will likely exceed bankfull. In
addition strong gusty winds will continue bring down branches and
trees, which may cause localized damming of water ways.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Entire San Francisco Bay Area and Central Coast including:
Sonoma, Napa, Marin, Contra Costa, Alameda, San Francisco, San
Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, San Benito, and Monterey counties.
* WHEN...Through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water crossings may be
flooded. Storm drains and ditches may become clogged with debris.
Extensive street flooding and flooding of creeks and rivers are
possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
