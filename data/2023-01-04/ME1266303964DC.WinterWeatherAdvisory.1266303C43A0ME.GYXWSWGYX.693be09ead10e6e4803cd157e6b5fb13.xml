<description>...WINTRY PRECIPITATION TO MAKE FOR SLIPPERY TRAVEL LATE TONIGHT
AND THURSDAY...
.Low pressure will move south of New England later today and
tonight. It will initially start as rain except for in the mountains
where snow and sleet is likely. Cooler air works southward across
the region tonight and tomorrow changing the precipitation to a mix
of light snow (confined mainly to the north), sleet, and freezing
rain which should continue through at least Thursday morning
allowing for slippery travel. Freezing drizzle is likely at times
afterward with light snow occasionally mixing in. Further south,
temperatures will take longer to cool however freezing drizzle and
some freezing rain will be possible at times through the daylight
hours of Thursday.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM EST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow and sleet
accumulations up to one inch and ice accumulations up to one tenth
of an inch.
* WHERE...In Maine, Southern Oxford County. In New Hampshire,
Northern Carroll, Northern Grafton, and Southern Coos Counties.
* WHEN...Until 5 PM EST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...A period of mixed precipitation is expected tonight into
Thursday with air temperatures falling below freezing after
midnight. Expect slippery road conditions and avoid travel if
possible. A slippery Thursday morning commute is expected with
slippery conditions perhaps continuing into the afternoon and
evening commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Precipitation will be less intense during the
day Thursday however freezing drizzle may still produce hazardous
driving conditions, especially on untreated roads.</description>
