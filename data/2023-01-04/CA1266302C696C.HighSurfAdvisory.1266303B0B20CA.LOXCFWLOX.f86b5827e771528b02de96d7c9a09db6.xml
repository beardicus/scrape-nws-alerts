<headline>High Surf Advisory issued January 04 at 10:11AM PST until January 05 at 6:00AM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM PST THURSDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM THURSDAY TO
1 PM PST FRIDAY...
...HIGH SURF WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM THURSDAY TO
10 AM PST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking
waves of 16 to 22 feet with dangerous rip currents. For the
High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 8 to 12 feet with
dangerous rip currents. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor
coastal flooding expected.
* WHERE...San Luis Obispo County Beaches and Santa Barbara
County Central Coast Beaches.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Warning, from 6 AM Thursday to 10 AM
PST Friday. For the High Surf Advisory, until 6 AM PST
Thursday. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 4 AM Thursday
to 1 PM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely, around the time of
high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as
parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to
roads or structures is NOT expected. Powerful waves and strong
rip currents will pose an exceptional risk of ocean drowning
and beach erosion. Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash
people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near
shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The best chance for coastal flooding is
during high tide. Tides peak Thursday morning and Friday
morning at 6.2 feet around 8:30 AM. Rip currents will become
strong as the tides begin to peak.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other water side
infrastructure.</instruction>
