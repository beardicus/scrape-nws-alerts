<headline>Flood Advisory issued January 04 at 10:53PM PST until January 05 at 12:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 730 AM PST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Urban and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Ventura County.
* WHEN...Until 730 AM PST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
Rises in small streams and normally dry arroyos. Water is expected
over area roadways including Highways 23, 33, 101, 126, and 150.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1045 PM PST, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated moderate to heavy rainfall across Santa Barbara
County and entering Ventura County from the west. The
moderate to heavy rainfall overspreading the county will
cause urban and small stream flooding and flooding of low-
lying areas across the advisory area.  Peak rainfall rates of
0.3 to 0.6 inches per hour will be common in the advisory
area, with up to around one inch per hour possible for south
facing mountain slopes. The long duration of these rainfall
rates will increase impacts across the region.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Oxnard, Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley, Ventura, Camarillo,
Fillmore, Ojai, Chatsworth, Moorpark, Santa Paula, Lockwood
Valley, and Westlake Village.

<instruction>Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
