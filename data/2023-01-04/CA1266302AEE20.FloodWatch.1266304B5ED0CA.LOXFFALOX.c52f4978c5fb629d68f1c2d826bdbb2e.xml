<headline>Flood Watch issued January 04 at 12:40AM PST until January 06 at 1:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH
THURSDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible within
the entire Watch area, with the greatest threat near and below the
Alisal burn scar and in urban areas.
* WHERE...San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties, including the
Alisal burn scar in southern Santa Barbara County.
* WHEN...From this afternoon through Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Significant flash flooding and debris flows are
possible, especially in and below the Alisal burn scar. Excessive
runoff may result in flooding of creeks, streams, and urban areas.
While the risk of main stem river flooding is low, water flowing
through normally dry rivers and washes may be a threat to some
homeless communities.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- An atmospheric river pushing through the region Wednesday
evening into Thursday morning will support periods of heavy
rainfall with rates up to around an inch per hour, prompting
concern for flooding and flash flooding across the region.
Rainfall totals of 2-4 inches will be common with 4-8 inches
expected in the mountains, highest across the Santa Lucia
mountains and Santa Ynez mountains east into south facing
interior Santa Barbara mountains.

to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
