<headline>Flood Advisory issued January 04 at 6:43PM EST  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM EST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Nuisance flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of piedmont North Carolina, including the
following county, Cabarrus.
* WHEN...Until 900 AM EST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
including woodlands, farmland, low-water crossings, parks,
greenways, golf courses, campgrounds, and boat-access areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 637 PM EST, The Rocky River from Harrisburg to Georgeville
to Midland is out of its banks and causing nuisance flooding
of adjacent low-lying areas following heavy rainfall from
earlier Wednesday.  The river is currently at 14.7 feet and
is rising slowly.  At these levels, the Rocky River is
flooding woodland and farmland near the river and backwater
effects may be causing lowland flooding along adjacent
tributaries, including along Back Creek near Pharr Mill Rd.
The Rocky River is expected to crest between 15.0 and 15.5
feet later tonight and gradually recede into Thursday
morning, falling below the Action/Advisory Stage of 12.0 feet
by later Thursday morning.  Therefore, a Flood Advisory for
nuisance lowland flooding will remain in effect until the
Rocky River falls below bankfull levels.
- Some locations that may experience flooding are low-lying
areas adjacent to the Rocky River from Harrisburg...to
Georgeville...to Midland.</description>
<instruction>Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.</instruction>
