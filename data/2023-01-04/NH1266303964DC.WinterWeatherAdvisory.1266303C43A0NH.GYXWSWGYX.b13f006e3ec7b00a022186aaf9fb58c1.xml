<description>...WINTRY PRECIPITATION TO MAKE FOR SLIPPERY TRAVEL LATE TONIGHT
AND THURSDAY...
.Low pressure will move south of New England later today and
tonight. It will initially start as rain except for in the mountains
where snow and sleet is likely. Cooler air works southward across
the region tonight and tomorrow changing the precipitation to a mix
of light snow (confined mainly to the north), sleet, and freezing
rain which should continue through at least Thursday morning
allowing for slippery travel. Freezing drizzle is likely at times
afterward with light snow occasionally mixing in. Further south,
temperatures will take longer to cool however freezing drizzle and
some freezing rain will be possible at times through the daylight
hours of Thursday.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM TO 5 PM EST
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Freezing rain and freezing drizzle are expected. Total ice
accumulations around a light glaze.

conditions. The hazardous conditions could impact the Thursday
morning and evening commutes.
