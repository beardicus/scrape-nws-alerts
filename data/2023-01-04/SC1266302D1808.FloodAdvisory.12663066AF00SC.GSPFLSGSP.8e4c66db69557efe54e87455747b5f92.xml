- At 548 PM EST, Lawsons Fork Creek remains above bankfull and
is flooding adjacent, low-lying areas from US 221 to Goldmine
Rd near the Pacolet River confluence, including portions of
the Country Club of Spartanburg and the Glendale Shoals
Preserve.  The stream is cresting near 13.5 feet and will

will take several hours for Lawsons Fork Creek to fall back
below the Action/Advisory Stage of 12.0 feet.  Therefore, the
Flood Advisory will remain in effect through this evening
until the stream recedes back within its banks.
