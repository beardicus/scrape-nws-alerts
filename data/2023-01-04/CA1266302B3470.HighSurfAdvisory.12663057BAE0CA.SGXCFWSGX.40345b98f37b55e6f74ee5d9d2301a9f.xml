<headline>High Surf Advisory issued January 04 at 2:20AM PST until January 06 at 6:00PM PST by NWS SanDiego</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON THURSDAY TO
6 PM PST FRIDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON THURSDAY TO
6 PM PST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding
expected. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of
8 to 13 feet.
* WHERE...Orange County Coastal Areas.
* WHEN...From noon Thursday to 6 PM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Dangerous swimming and
surfing conditions and localized beach erosion.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A westerly swell of 10 to 13 feet and a
period of 16 to 18 seconds from 270 degrees will produce very
high surf. The surf will steadily increase late Thursday to
around 8 feet, then increase to as high as 13 feet early Friday
morning. The limiting factor will be the southwest versus west
orientation of the coastline. This should be a short-lived event
as the swell will subside rapidly late Friday and Friday night.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.</instruction>
