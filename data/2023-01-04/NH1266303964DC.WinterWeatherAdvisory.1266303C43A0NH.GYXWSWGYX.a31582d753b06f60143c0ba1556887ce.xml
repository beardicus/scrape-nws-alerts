<description>...WINTRY PRECIPITATION TO MAKE FOR SLIPPERY TRAVEL LATE TONIGHT
AND THURSDAY...
.Low pressure will move south of New England later today and
tonight. It will initially start as rain except for in the mountains
where snow and sleet is likely. Cooler air works southward across
the region tonight and tomorrow changing the precipitation to a mix
of light snow (confined mainly to the north), sleet, and freezing
rain which should continue through at least Thursday morning
allowing for slippery travel. Freezing drizzle is likely at times
afterward with light snow occasionally mixing in. Further south,
temperatures will take longer to cool however freezing drizzle and
some freezing rain will be possible at times through the daylight
hours of Thursday.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM EST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation. Total snow and sleet accumulations
between 2 and 4 inches and ice accumulations around a light glaze.
* WHERE...In Maine, Southern Somerset, Northern Franklin, Northern
Oxford, and Southern Franklin Counties. In New Hampshire, Northern
Coos County.
* WHEN...Until 5 PM EST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...A period of mixed precipitation is expected tonight and
tomorrow. Expect slippery road conditions and avoid travel if
possible. Even light snowfall amounts can accumulate on roads and
cause dangerous driving conditions due to snow covered roads. The
hazardous conditions will impact the Thursday morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Precipitation will be less intense during the
day Thursday however freezing drizzle may still produce hazardous
driving conditions, especially on untreated roads.</description>
