<description>...CREEKS STILL RUNNING HIGH AND SOME ROADS REMAIN CLOSED...
Creeks and streams continue to run high, with some roads still
closed across the area due to high water. Additional rainfall
today, while not as heavy as that of yesterday, could lead to
some continued high water issues across the area given the
already saturated conditions.
Never attempt to drive through a flooded roadway. Please continue
to heed any road closures posted by local authorities.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which
are potentially dangerous during and after heavy rain. Do not
attempt to travel across flooded roads. Find alternate routes.
The water depth may be too great to allow your car to cross
safely. It is especially hard to tell the depth of the water at
night. It takes only a few inches of swiftly flowing water to
carry vehicles away.</description>
