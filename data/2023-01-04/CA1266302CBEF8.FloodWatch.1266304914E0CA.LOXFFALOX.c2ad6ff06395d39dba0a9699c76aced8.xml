<headline>Flood Watch issued January 04 at 12:30PM PST until January 05 at 10:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM PST THIS AFTERNOON
THROUGH THURSDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible within
the entire Watch area. Areas of most concern include the Alisal
burn scar, urban roads and freeways, and in creeks and streams.
* WHERE...All of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties,
including the Alisal burn scar.
* WHEN...From 4 PM PST this afternoon through Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Significant flash flooding is possible anywhere. This
includes mud and debris flows in and below the Alisal burn scar.
Urban areas should expect significant flooding of some roads and
freeways, with major delays or closures. Excessive runoff will
result in flooding of creeks and streams. While the risk of main
stem river flooding is low, water flowing through normally dry
rivers and washes will threaten homeless encampments.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A strong atmospheric river storm will bring periods of
widespread heavy rainfall with rates up to around an inch per
hour. Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches will be common over
urban areas, with 4 to 8 inches expected in the mountains and
foothills, especially over the Santa Lucia and Santa Ynez
ranges. Isolated amounts of 10 inches are possible.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding, including the
Alisal burn scar, should be prepared to take action should flooding
develop or evacuations are ordered.</instruction>
