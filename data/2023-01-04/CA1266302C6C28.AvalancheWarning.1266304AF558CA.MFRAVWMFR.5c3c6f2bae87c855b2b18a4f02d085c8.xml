<description>...AVALANCHE WARNING IN EFFECT FROM NOW THROUGH 9 AM PST SUNDAY...
THE USDA FOREST SERVICE MOUNT SHASTA AVALANCHE CENTER HAS ISSUED
AN AVALANCHE WARNING FOR THE MOUNT SHASTA AREA OF NORTHERN
CALIFORNIA....EFFECTIVE FROM NOW THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING.
A SERIES OF STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEMS WITH CONECTIONS TO THE
SUBTROPICS WILL MAINTAIN ATMOSPHERIC RIVER CONDITIONS AND IMPACT
THE REGION FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK. HEAVY, WIDESPREAD
PRECIPITAITON AND STRONG WINDS ARE EXPECTED OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL
DAYS. STRONG WINDS ARE LIKELY NEAR AND ABOVE TREELINE DURING THE
HEAVIEST SNOWFALL.
ADDITIONALLY...WEAK LAYERS EXIST IN THE SNOWPACK. THIS WEAKNESS...
COMBINED WITH HEAVY SNOWFALL AND WIND LOADING...WILL INCREASE THE
AVALANCHE DANGER THIS WEEK. THESE CONDITIONS WILL CREATE HIGH
AVALANCHE DANGER IN THE BACK COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY ABOVE 7000 FEET,
WHERE BOTH NATURAL AND HUMAN-TRIGGERED AVALANCHES ARE LIKELY.
CONCERNS WILL CONTINUE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS AS SNOWFALL AND
WINDS CONTINUE TO STRESS SLOPES.
STAY OFF AND AWAY FROM SLOPES STEEPER THAN 30 DEGREES.
PEOPLE WITHOUT BACK COUNTRY AVALANCHE SKILLS ARE ADVISED TO STAY
OUT OF THE BACK COUNTRY...ESPECIALLY ABOVE 7000 FEET.
THIS STATEMENT DOES NOT INCLUDE SKI AREAS AND HIGHWAYS WHERE
AVALANCHE MITIGATION IS NORMALLY DONE.
