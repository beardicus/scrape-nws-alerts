<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued January 04 at 2:20AM PST until January 06 at 6:00PM PST by NWS SanDiego</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON THURSDAY TO 6 PM
PST FRIDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON THURSDAY TO
6 PM PST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking
waves of 10 to 16 feet. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor
coastal flooding expected.
* WHERE...San Diego County Coastal Areas.
* WHEN...From noon Thursday to 6 PM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Breaking waves can sweep
people off jetties and docks, and into dangerous seas. Life-
threatening swimming conditions and significant beach erosion
can be expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A westerly swell of 10 to 13 feet and a
period of 16 to 18 seconds from 270 degrees will produce very
high surf. The surf will steadily increase late Thursday to
around 10 feet, then increase to as high as 16 feet early Friday
morning. This should be a short-lived event as the surf will
subside rapidly late Friday and Friday night.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other waterside
infrastructure.</instruction>
