<description>...WINTRY PRECIPITATION TO MAKE FOR SLIPPERY TRAVEL TONIGHT
AND THURSDAY...
.Low pressure will move south of New England later today and
tonight. It will initially start as rain except for in the mountains
where snow and sleet is likely with some freezing rain possible.
Eventually colder air works southward across the entire region
tonight changing the precipitation to a mix of light snow, sleet,
and freezing rain which should continue through at least Thursday
morning allowing for slippery travel.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM THIS EVENING
TO NOON EST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow and sleet
accumulations up to 3 inches and ice accumulations around one
tenth of an inch.
* WHERE...Portions of south central and western Maine. Portions of
northern New Hampshire.
* WHEN...From 7 PM this evening to Noon EST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...A mixture of snow and sleet is then expected tonight. A
mixture of snow, sleet, and freezing rain is expected on Thursday.
Expect slippery road conditions and avoid travel if possible. Even
light snowfall amounts can accumulate on roads and cause dangerous
driving conditions due to snow covered roads. The hazardous
conditions will impact the Thursday morning commute.</description>
