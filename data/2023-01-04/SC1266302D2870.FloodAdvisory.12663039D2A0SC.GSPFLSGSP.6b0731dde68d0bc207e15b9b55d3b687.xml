* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 600 PM EST, Eighteenmile Creek near Pendleton remains
above Action/Advisory Stage and is causing nuisance flooding
of adjacent low-lying areas including near Bishop Branch Rd
and Central Rd.  The creek is currently at 11.23 feet and is
cresting.  The creek is expected to fall below the
Action/Advisory Stage of 11.0 feet later tonight.  The Flood
Advisory will therefore remain in effect until the stream
recedes back below Action/Advisory Stage.  Please continue to
avoid flooded roadways and stay away from elevated streams.

include...Pendleton.</description>
