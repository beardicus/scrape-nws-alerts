the advisory area. Rainfall rates between 0.33 and 0.50 inch
per hour are possible with this band of rainfall. Local
rainfall rates up to 1 inch per hour could occur, especially
along the south facing slopes of the Santa Ynez Range.

<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas only if it is safe to do so.
The rain will likely trigger shallow mud and debris flows, minor
rock falls, and flooding capable of localized damage, especially in
steep terrain in and near burn scars.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding. Do not drive on flooded roads. Please report
observed flooding to local emergency services or law enforcement and
request they pass this information to the National Weather Service
when you can do so safely.</instruction>
