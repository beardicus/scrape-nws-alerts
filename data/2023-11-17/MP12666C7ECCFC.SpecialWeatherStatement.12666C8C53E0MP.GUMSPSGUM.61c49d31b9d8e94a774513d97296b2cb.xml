<description>...TROPICAL DISTURBANCE TO PASS NEAR GUAM THIS WEEKEND...
A tropical disturbance, Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) Invest
98W, is centered near 7N152E. Latest model guidance continues to show
this circulation developing slowly over the next few days as it
approaches the Marianas. Models are in fairly good agreement that the
system will move through to the south of Guam, though this is
subject to change as the circulation develops. There is a possibility
that this disturbance could become a tropical depression by the time
it passes near Guam late Saturday, but latest trends have been
indicating a slightly lower potential that depends heavily on the
storm forward speed towards the much more favorable wind shear
environment near the region. This system is expected to bring
increased showers and thunderstorms to the Marianas, especially Guam
and Rota, over the weekend, with wet conditions likely Saturday into
Sunday morning. Current rainfall estimates are for 2 to 4 inches of
rain to fall between Saturday and late Sunday night.
As Invest 98W strengthens and approaches the Marianas, increasing
winds, hazardous seas, numerous heavy showers and isolated
thunderstorms are expected. Locally heavy showers leading to
urban/small stream flooding. Flash flooding is also possible
Saturday into Sunday, albeit support for such potential is decreasing
in the recent model cycles. Marine conditions are also expected to
become hazardous, with wind gusts as high as 35 knots, and seas of 9
to 11 feet possible during closest passage to Guam in the Saturday
thru Sunday time frame.
Residents of the Marianas should monitor these changing conditions
over the next few days and watch for any updates to the forecast.
