<description>...LOCALLY DENSE FOG AND PATCHY FROST DURING THE COMMUTE THIS
MORNING...
Shallow dense fog has developed along much of the Lower Columbia,
Cowlitz, and Willamette Rivers early this morning, reducing
visibility to as low as a few hundred feet in some locations. The
dense fog is impacting portions of the Interstate 5 corridor in
southwest Washington, the Vancouver metro area, as well as much
of North and Northeast Portland. Fog is less widespread elsewhere
in the Portland metro area.
In addition to the fog, temperatures near freezing are leading to
locally frosty roads across the greater Portland and Vancouver
metro area, especially where it has remained clear.
Drivers involved in this morning`s commute should be prepared for
locally slick roads and rapid changes in visibility. Fog and
frost will diminish within a couple hours after sunrise.</description>
