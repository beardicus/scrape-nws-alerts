<description>...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Up to one half foot of inundation above ground level
expected in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline
during late afternoon and this evening high tide cycle.
* WHERE...Northwest Suffolk, Northeast Suffolk and Southeast
Suffolk Counties.
* WHEN...From 4 PM EDT this afternoon through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Some water on low lying roads and property.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Some water on low lying roads and
property. Along the oceanfront, large breaking waves and
elevated water levels will result in significant beach erosion
and flooding. Areas of dune base erosion are likely, with low
threat of localized washovers. Along the north facing
shorelines of eastern Long Island, including Orient Point,
breaking waves of 2 to 3 ft may cause minor beach erosion and
flooding issues around the time of the later afternoon and
evening high tide.</description>
