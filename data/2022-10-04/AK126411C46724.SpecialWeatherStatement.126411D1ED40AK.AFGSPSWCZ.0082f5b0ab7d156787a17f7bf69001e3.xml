<description>...Strong Storm Moving to the Eastern Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea
Wednesday Through Friday...
A strong storm is developing in the Sea of Ohkotsk and will move
to Chukotsk Peninsula Wednesday, and to Wrangel Island by
Thursday morning. The storm will continue northeast into the
Arctic Ocean on Friday.
Strong southerly to southwesterly winds are expected to accompany
this storm moving into the Eastern Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea
Wednesday afternoon and evening with the weather front moving to
the coast early Thursday morning. Behind the front winds will turn
more westerly.
This storm will bring potential for high surf and erosion to
south and west facing shores from the Bering Strait to Norton
Sound Wednesday night through Friday. In addition, elevated water
levels bring potential for minor coastal flooding to low lying
areas in Northern Norton Sound, and to Deering on the northern
Seward Peninsula.
There is a higher threat of coastal flooding and significant
erosion from the Bering Strait north to Utqiagvik and Coastal
Flood Watches have been issued for this area.
