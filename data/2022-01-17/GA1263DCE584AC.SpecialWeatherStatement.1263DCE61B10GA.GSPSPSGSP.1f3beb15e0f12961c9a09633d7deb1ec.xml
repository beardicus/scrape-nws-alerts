<description>...AREAS OF BLACK ICE CAUSING TREACHEROUS ROAD CONDITIONS
THIS MORNING...
A winter storm affected much of the region with ice, snow, and
sleet Saturday night and Sunday. Roads became wet and slushy in
many areas as temperatures warmed Sunday afternoon, but many of
those roads are likely to become icy again this morning.
Slippery, treacherous road conditions will likely persist through
this morning. Although some melting is expected today as
temperatures warm above freezing under abundant sunshine, some
secondary or shaded roads may remain treacherous through the day.
Transportation agencies are advising the public to stay off roads
this morning unless absolutely necessary. Any motorists that do
venture out are urged to use extreme caution. If a road looks wet,
it likely is covered in a thin sheet of ice.</description>
