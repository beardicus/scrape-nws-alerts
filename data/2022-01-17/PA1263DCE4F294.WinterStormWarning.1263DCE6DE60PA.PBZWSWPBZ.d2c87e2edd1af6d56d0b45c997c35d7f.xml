your vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road conditions for

Persons should delay all travel if possible until Monday afternoon
at the earliest. If travel is absolutely necessary, drive with
extreme caution and be prepared for sudden changes in visibility.

allow extra time to reach your destination. Avoid sudden braking or
acceleration, and be especially cautious on hills or when making
turns. Make sure your car is winterized and in good working order.</instruction>
