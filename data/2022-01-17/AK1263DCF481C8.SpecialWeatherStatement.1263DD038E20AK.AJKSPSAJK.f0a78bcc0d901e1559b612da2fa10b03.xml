<description>...SNOW CHANGING TO RAIN, POSSIBLY HEAVY, WITH RISING SNOW LEVELS
LATE WEEK...
Signals continue to point to a possible atmospheric river event
late this week into the weekend including warming temperatures,
rising snow levels, and the potential for accumulating snow
changing to heavy rain. Winter Storm Watches are in effect for a
period of accumulating snow Wednesday morning through Thursday
morning before the main storm arrives. A short break is possible
Thursday evening before heavy precipitation starts Friday morning.
At sea level, the precipitation may start as a mix of snow and
rain before quickly changing to all rain, heavy at times. Snow
will hang on longer for the Haines and Klondike highways and at
higher elevations, with heavy snow possible near the Canadian
border of the Klondike highway. Rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches
are possible from Friday through Sunday. Snowfall amounts of
around 6 inches are possible out the Haines highway and up to 18
inches at White Pass with lower amounts at lower elevations. Snow
levels are forecast to rise to around 2,500 feet which could lead
to a melting mountain snowpack and introduce some nuisance
flooding concerns. Rain over deep snow on top of structures and
rooftops could challenge load limits. Please stay tuned to the
forecast as it is refined through the week.</description>
