<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 17 at 4:03AM EST until January 17 at 1:00PM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM EST THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...A brief period of heavy snow expected. Total snow
accumulations of 4 to 6 inches expected. Winds gusting as high
as 50 mph.
* WHERE...In New Hampshire, Interior Rockingham County. In
Maine, Coastal Cumberland and Coastal York Counties.
* WHEN...Until 1 PM EST this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Roads will become snow covered and slippery. Intense
snowfall rates will make for worse driving conditions than
usual, and a switch to rain will make remaining snow covered
roads even more slippery. Strong winds may cause power outages.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Heavy snowfall rates are anticipated,
with rates of 1 to 3 inches per hour expected at times. The
snow is then expected to change to rain during the late
morning and early afternoon. Clogged storm drains may lead to
ponding of water on roadways once precipitation changes to
rain. Cold and windy conditions return Monday night and
Tuesday with low wind chill values developing.</description>
