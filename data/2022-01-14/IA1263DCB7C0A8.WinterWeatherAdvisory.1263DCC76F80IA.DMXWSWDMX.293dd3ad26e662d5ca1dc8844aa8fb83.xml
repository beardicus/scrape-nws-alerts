<description>...Winter Storm to Impact the Area Today through Early Saturday
Morning...
.A winter storm will impact much of central Iowa today into early
Saturday, bringing with it moderate to heavy snowfall. Travel
impacts are expected to be significant at times, especially
during afternoon school departures and the evening commute.
Widespread amounts of 6 to 10 inches of snow is expected across
the warning area with locally higher amounts possible. Winds will
be out of the east to northeast and will increase to 15 to 25 mph
with a few gusts over 30 mph tonight. The winds, combined with
snow, will yield very low visibilities at times and produce
pockets of blowing and drifting snow, particularly in open, rural
areas.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM THIS
MORNING TO 6 AM CST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 3 to 6
inches.
* WHERE...Portions of western and southwest Iowa.
* WHEN...From 11 AM Friday to 6 AM CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slick road conditions. Patchy blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions
could impact the evening commute.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
