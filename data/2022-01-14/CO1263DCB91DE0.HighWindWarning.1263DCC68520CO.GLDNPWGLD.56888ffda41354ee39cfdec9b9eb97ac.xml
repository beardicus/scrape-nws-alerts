<headline>High Wind Warning issued January 14 at 11:16AM MST until January 14 at 11:00PM MST by NWS Goodland</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM MST /MIDNIGHT
CST/ THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...North winds 30 to 45 mph with gusts up to 60 mph.
* WHERE...Along and south of Interstate 70 in eastern Colorado
and northwest Kansas.
* WHEN...Until 11 PM MST /midnight CST/ this evening.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous travel conditions are anticipated to be
the primary impact, especially on west to east routes such as
Interstate 70, where cross winds will be strongest. High
profile vehicles will see the worst impacts.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...At 1102 AM MST, the National Weather
Service in Goodland measured a north wind sustained at 44 mph
gusting to 58 mph.</description>
<instruction>Wind of this magnitude may down trees, power lines, and damage
property. If you must drive, watch for objects blowing across the
roadway and into your path. Keep a safe distance from cars in
adjacent lanes as strong gusts could suddenly push a vehicle
outside its lane of travel. Take extra care in high-profile
vehicles such as a truck, van, or SUV, or when towing a trailer,
as these are more prone to be pushed or even flipped by high
winds.
High dust concentrations can aggravate asthma and cause respiratory
problems, especially in children, the elderly, or those with pre-
existing respiratory conditions. The Kansas Department of Health
and Environment recommends taking preventative measures such as
staying indoors or wearing protective breathing masks, if outside.</instruction>
