<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 14 at 4:41AM EST until January 17 at 8:00AM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY EVENING
THROUGH MONDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation possible. Total snow
accumulations of 6 to 10 inches are expected across the mountain
valleys and extreme northeast Georgia, with 8 to 12 inches along
and near the Blue Ridge Escarpment, and 12 to 20 inches at
elevations above 4000 feet. Ice accumulations of up to one tenth
of an inch are also possible.
* WHERE...The mountains of the Carolinas and northeast Georgia.
* WHEN...From Saturday evening through Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Precipitation may begin as early as
Saturday afternoon across parts of the mountains, eventually
falling as mostly snow and increasing in coverage and intensity
late Saturday night. The precipitation may briefly change to
sleet and freezing rain before tapering off Sunday afternoon and
evening in most areas, although snow showers are expected to
linger along the Tennessee border into Monday morning.
Widespread black ice should be expected Monday morning, and may
be a concern into the middle of the week. Later guidance may
change snow amounts and will determine when a Warning is issued.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Watch means there is a potential for significant
snow, sleet, or ice accumulations that may impact travel.
