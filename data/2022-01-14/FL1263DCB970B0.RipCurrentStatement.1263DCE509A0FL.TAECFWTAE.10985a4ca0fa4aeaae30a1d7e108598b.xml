<headline>Rip Current Statement issued January 14 at 3:28PM EST until January 17 at 1:00AM EST by NWS Tallahassee</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE SUNDAY
NIGHT...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM SATURDAY TO 7 PM EST
SUNDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, minor to moderate coastal
flooding expected with water levels 1 to 2 feet above normally
dry ground west of St Teresa and 2 to 4 feet above normally dry
ground from St Teresa to the Ochlockonee River. For the High
Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Coastal Franklin County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, from 7 PM Saturday to 7 PM
EST Sunday. Highest water levels are expected around the high
tide early Sunday morning around 1 AM. For the High Rip Current
Risk, through late Sunday night.
* IMPACTS...Water levels are anticipated to be highest from Saint
Teresa to Alligator Point. In these areas, several roads along
the coast will flood, particularly Alligator Point Road.
Structures not elevated on Bald Point or Alligator Point will be
prone to flooding. Minor flooding is expected in Apalachicola
where Water Street and other low lying areas will flood. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property along
the coast. If travel is required, do not drive around barricades
or through water of unknown depth.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
