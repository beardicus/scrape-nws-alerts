<headline>Coastal Flood Watch issued January 14 at 4:14PM EST until January 17 at 1:00PM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH
MONDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Two to three feet of inundation above ground level
possible in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...Northeast Suffolk, Southwest Suffolk, Southeast
Suffolk and Southern Nassau Counties.
* WHEN...During the times of high tides late Sunday night through
Monday afternoon.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Widespread moderate to locally major
flooding of vulnerable areas is possible near the waterfront and
shoreline, including roads, parking lots, parks, lawns, and
homes and businesses with basements near the waterfront.
Numerous road closures are possible, and vehicles parked in
vulnerable areas near the waterfront may become flooded.
Flooding will also extend inland from the waterfront along tidal
rivers and bays.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...Large breaking waves will result in
significant beach erosion and flooding. Areas of dune erosion
and localized washovers are possible, resulting in some flooding
of roadways and vulnerable structures behind protective dunes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The potential for major coastal flooding (3
ft above ground) is for the most vulnerable areas of southern
Nassau County and along Peconic Bay and river front. This
potential will depend on strong easterly winds continuing
through the time of high tide Monday morning. The higher
probability at this time is that winds weaken and shift to the
south before high tide, which would likely keep flooding at
moderate flood levels (2 to 2 1/2 ft above ground).</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
