<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EST
SATURDAY...
...WIND CHILL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM EST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Dangerously cold wind chills and blowing snow expected.
Wind chills as low as 45 below zero expected. Winds gusting as
high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Northwest Aroostook, Northeast Aroostook, Northern
Penobscot and Southeast Aroostook Counties.
* WHEN...For the Wind Chill Warning, from 10 PM this evening to
1 PM EST Saturday. For the Winter Weather Advisory, until 7 PM
EST Saturday.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas
of blowing snow will significantly reduce visibility and cause
hazardous travel. The dangerously cold wind chills could cause
frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.</description>
<instruction>A Wind Chill Warning means the combination of very cold air and
the wind will create dangerously low wind chill values. Frostbite
can occur quickly and even hypothermia or death if precautions
are not taken.
A Winter Weather Advisory means blowing snow will cause primarily
travel difficulties. Expect snow covered roads and limited
visibilities, and use caution while driving.
The latest road conditions for Maine can be obtained by going to
