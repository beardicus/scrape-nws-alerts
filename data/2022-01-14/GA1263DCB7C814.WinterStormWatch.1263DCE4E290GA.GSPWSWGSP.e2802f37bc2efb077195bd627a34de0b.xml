<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 14 at 4:41AM EST until January 17 at 12:00AM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE SATURDAY NIGHT
THROUGH SUNDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation possible. Total snow
accumulations of 6 to 12 inches expected over the North Carolina
foothills. 2 to 5 inches of sleet, snow, and ice are expected
from the northeast Georgia and South Carolina foothills, through
western portions of the Charlotte metro area, into the northwest
Piedmont of North Carolina. Ice accumulation of one quarter to
one half inch with light sleet and snow accumulations are
expected across much of the remainder of the Carolina Piedmont,
including much of Charlotte and vicinity.
* WHERE...Portions of upstate South Carolina, northeast Georgia
and the western Piedmont and foothills of North Carolina.
* WHEN...From late Saturday night through Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be nearly impossible across the entire
area. At least scattered power outages and tree damage are
likely across the Piedmont due to the ice as well as gusty
winds.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Precipitation will begin Saturday evening
and will gradually change over to a wintry mix across much of
the region Sunday morning, although mainly snow is expected
across the North Carolina foothills. A mix of all precipitation
types is expected closer to the I-85 corridor, while mostly
freezing rain is forecast for areas southeast of I-85. The
precipitation should taper off Sunday afternoon and evening,
perhaps as a period of light snow. Black ice could be a problem
each morning early next week. Later guidance may affect
precipitation types and amounts, and when a Warning would be
issued.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Watch means there is a potential for significant
