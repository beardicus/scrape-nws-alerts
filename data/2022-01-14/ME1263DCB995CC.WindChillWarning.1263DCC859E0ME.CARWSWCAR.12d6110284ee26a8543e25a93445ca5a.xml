<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EST SATURDAY...
...WIND CHILL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 10 PM THIS EVENING

* WHAT...Dangerously cold wind chills and blowing snow expected.
Wind chills as low as 45 below zero expected. Winds gusting as
high as 40 mph.

Penobscot and Southeast Aroostook Counties.
* WHEN...For the Wind Chill Warning, from 10 PM this evening to
1 PM EST Saturday. For the Winter Weather Advisory, until 7 PM

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of

<instruction>A Wind Chill Warning means the combination of very cold air and
the wind will create dangerously low wind chill values. Frostbite
can occur quickly and even hypothermia or death if precautions
are not taken.
A Winter Weather Advisory means blowing snow will cause primarily
travel difficulties. Expect snow covered roads and limited
visibilities, and use caution while driving.
