<headline>Coastal Flood Watch issued January 14 at 4:14PM EST until January 17 at 1:00PM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH
MONDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Two to three feet of inundation above ground level
possible in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...In Connecticut, Southern Fairfield, Southern New
Haven, Southern Middlesex and Southern New London Counties. In
New York, Southern Westchester, Bronx, Northwest Suffolk,
Northern Queens and Northern Nassau Counties.
* WHEN...From late Sunday night through Monday afternoon.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Widespread moderate flooding of
vulnerable areas is possible near the waterfront and shoreline,
including roads, parking lots, parks, lawns, and homes and
businesses with basements near the waterfront. Several road
closures are possible, and vehicles parked in vulnerable areas
near the waterfront may become flooded. Flooding will also
extend inland from the waterfront along tidal rivers and bays.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...Breaking waves of 4 to 6 ft will result in
beach erosion, wave splashover onto shoreline streets and
properties, and minor damage possible to shorefront structures.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...There is potential for locally major
flooding (3 ft above ground level) for southern Westchester and
coastal southwestern Connecticut if strong easterly winds and
high waves continue through the time of high tide Monday
morning. The higher probability at this time is that winds
weaken and shift to the south before high tide, which would
reduce wave action and likely keep flooding at moderate flood
levels (2 to 2 1/2 ft above ground).</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
