<description>...AIR QUALITY ADVISORY FOR SMOG IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM PDT
THURSDAY...
The Southwest Clean Air Agency and the Oregon Department of
Environmental Quality has issued an Air Quality Advisory due to
elevated levels of ozone pollution, or smog. The advisory covers
the Portland-Vancouver metro area to the Salem area. The advisory is
in effect until 6 AM Thursday.
Air quality agencies expect pollution to reach levels that could be
unhealthy for sensitive groups, including children, pregnant people,
older adults, and people with heart disease or respiratory
conditions. Health officials recommend that people limit outdoor
activity when pollution levels are high.
The agencies urge residents to protect their health and limit activities
that cause pollution. Recommendations include:
- Limit driving by using public transit, carpooling or other
alternative transportation.
- Avoid unnecessary engine idling.
- Refuel vehicles during cooler evening hours.
- Postpone yard work that uses gas-powered equipment.
- Postpone painting and aerosol spray projects.
Smog irritates the eyes, nose and lungs, and contributes to breathing
problems. Consult your health care provider if these symptoms
worsen.
Ozone forms when hot temperatures and low winds combine with
pollution from cars, gas-powered engines and chemicals in paints and
aerosols. These air pollutants react with sunlight and heat to
produce ozone and haze.
Ozone pollution increases throughout the day with exposure to sunlight,
so pollution levels tend to be highest during afternoons and early
evenings. Air quality monitors may show good air quality in the
morning, then quickly jump to unhealthy levels later in the day.

Quality Index or by downloading the free OregonAIR app on a
