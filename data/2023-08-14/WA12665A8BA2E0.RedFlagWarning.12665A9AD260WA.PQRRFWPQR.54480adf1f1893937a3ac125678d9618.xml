<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM PDT TUESDAY FOR DRY AND
UNSTABLE CONDITIONS FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONES 605, 607, AND 660...
The National Weather Service in Portland has issued a Red Flag
Warning for wind and low relative humidity, which is in effect
until 11 PM PDT Tuesday.
* AFFECTED AREA...In Oregon, Fire Weather Zone 605 North Oregon
Cascade Foothills and Fire Weather Zone 607 Mt. Hood National
Forest West of Cascade Crest. In Washington, Fire Weather Zone
660 Extreme South Washington Cascades and Foothills.
* WINDS...East 5 to 10 mph, mainly on ridges. Winds will become
north to northwest 5 to 10 mph in the afternoon.
* INSTABILITY...High haines (values of 5 to 6) indicated rather
unstable air mass, such that strong vertical motion could
promote plume dominated fire growth, with enhanced burning on
any new fire starts.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...18 to 25 percent.
* IMPACTS...Conditions may be favorable for rapid fire spread
which may threaten life and property. Use extra caution with
potential ignition sources, especially in grassy areas.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now, or will shortly. A combination of the
above conditions can contribute to extreme fire behavior.</instruction>
