<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 AM PDT THURSDAY...
Oregon Department of Environmental Quality has issued an Air
Pollution Advisory...in effect until 2 AM PDT Thursday.
Air quality agencies expect pollution to reach levels that could be
unhealthy for sensitive groups, including children, pregnant people,
older adults, and people with heart disease or respiratory
conditions. Health officials recommend that people limit outdoor
activity when pollution levels are high.
The agencies urge residents to protect their health and limit
activities that cause pollution.
Recommendations include:
Limit driving by using public transit, carpooling or other
alternative transportations.
Avoid unnecessary engine idling.
Refuel vehicles during cooler evening hours.
Postpone yard work that use gas-powered equipment.
Postpone painting and aerosol spray projects.
Smog irritates the eyes, nose, and lungs, and contributes to
breathing problems. Consult your health care provider if these
symptoms worsen.
Ozone forms when hot temperatures and low winds combine with
pollution from cars, gas-powered engines and chemicals in paints and
aerosols. These air pollutants react with sunlight and heat to
produce ozone and haze.
Ozone pollution increases throughout the day with exposure to
sunlight, so pollution levels tend to be highest during afternoons
and early evenings. Air quality monitors may show good air quality
in the morning, the quickly jump to unhealthy levels later in the
day.
