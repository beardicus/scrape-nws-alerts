<description>...HOT...DRY...WINDY...AND UNSTABLE CONDITIONS TODAY FOLLOWED BY
ISOLATED TO SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS EXPECTED THIS WEEK...
.A very hot and dry air mass will produce low afternoon
humidities, and when combined with afternoon and evening winds,
critical fire weather conditions are expected for valleys west of the
Cascades. Dry and unstable conditions could lead to rapid fire
growth at the Flat Fire or any other active fires in the area.
Additionally, monsoonal/tropical moisture will bring isolated to
scattered thunderstorms through week.
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM TO 11 PM PDT TUESDAY FOR
ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONES 623 AND
624...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
WEDNESDAY EVENING ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE
WEATHER ZONES 623 AND 624...
The National Weather Service in Medford has issued a Red Flag
Warning, which is in effect from 2 PM to 11 PM PDT Tuesday. A Fire
Weather Watch has also been issued and is in effect from
Wednesday afternoon through Wednesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Any fires that develop have a high probability of
spreading rapidly. Abundant lightning can also ignite new fires
and strain fire fighting resources.
* AFFECTED AREA...For the warning...the northern portions of Fire
weather zones 623 and 624. For the watch...portions of Fire
weather zones 623 and 624.
* THUNDERSTORMS...Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are expected

wet cores are still likely.

<instruction>Avoid tossing burning cigarettes on the ground, parking hot
vehicles on dry vegetation, and using equipment that can cause
sparks. Follow all fire restrictions. Find links to restrictions
at weather.gov/medford/wildfire. One less spark, one less
wildfire.
Gather your fire evacuation kit now and familiarize yourself with
your evacuation plan. Collect essentials you don`t want to lose
and prioritize your checklist. Visit ready.gov/kit for more
information.
A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now or will shortly. These conditions
promote rapid spread of fire which may become life threatening.
Evacuate if ordered to, or if a fire threatens.
A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are possible during the valid watch time. These conditions could
promote the rapid spread of wildfires which could become life-
threatening. Check weather.gov/medford for forecast updates and a
possible upgrade of the this watch to a Red Flag Warning.</instruction>
