<description>...Mendenhall Lake Has Crested And Is On Its Way Down...
Mendenhall Lake crested during the overnight time frame below
bankful, reaching a height of just under 8 ft. The lake has begun
dropping again. The latest webcam image from Suicide Basin
indicates that the basin is still rising. This tells us that the
most likely reason for the rising lake level is due to runoff from
heavy rainfall as well as increased upper elevation ice melt.
With limited data to work with, the lake level is expected to
continue falling through the day on Monday, before a system
moving into the panhandle will bring more rain to Juneau. This
system will be weaker than the system likely responsible for the
recent rise in the lake`s level. Continue to monitor
www.weather.gov/juneau for any additional updates.</description>
