<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued August 14 at 1:39PM PDT until August 16 at 11:00PM PDT by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...HOT...DRY...WINDY...AND UNSTABLE CONDITIONS TODAY FOLLOWED BY
ISOLATED TO SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS EXPECTED THIS WEEK...
.A very hot and dry air mass will produce low afternoon
humidities, and when combined with afternoon and evening winds,
critical fire weather conditions are expected for valleys west of the
Cascades. Dry and unstable conditions could lead to rapid fire
growth at the Flat Fire or any other active fires in the area.
Additionally, monsoonal/tropical moisture will bring isolated to
scattered thunderstorms through week.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
WEDNESDAY EVENING FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE
WEATHER ZONES 280, 281, 284, AND 621...
The National Weather Service in Medford has issued a Fire Weather
Watch, which is in effect from Wednesday afternoon through
Wednesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Any fires that develop have a high probability of
spreading rapidly. Abundant lightning can also ignite new fires
and strain fire fighting resources.
* AFFECTED AREA...In California...portions of Fire weather zones
280...281...and 284. In Oregon...the eastern portions of Fire
weather zone 621.
* THUNDERSTORMS...Isolated thunderstorms are expected Tuesday.
Scattered thunderstorms will be possible over a broader area on
Wednesday. Storms will be a hybrid of wet/dry on Tuesday and
trend wetter on Wednesday, but lightning strikes outside of the
wet cores are still likely.
* OUTFLOW WINDS...Gusts 30 to 40 mph.
* DETAILED URL...View the hazard area in detail at

<instruction>If you have not packed your evacuation kit yet, now is the time
to do so. This includes items like important documents and
essentials you cannot live without. Fill your vehicle`s fuel
tank. Visit ready.gov/kit for more information.
Plan now to avoid using equipment that could cause sparks during
the period when critical weather conditions are possible. Visit
weather.gov/medford/wildfire for links to fire restrictions in
your area.
A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are possible during the valid watch time. These conditions could
promote the rapid spread of wildfires which could become life-
threatening. Check weather.gov/medford for forecast updates and a
possible upgrade of the this watch to a Red Flag Warning.</instruction>
