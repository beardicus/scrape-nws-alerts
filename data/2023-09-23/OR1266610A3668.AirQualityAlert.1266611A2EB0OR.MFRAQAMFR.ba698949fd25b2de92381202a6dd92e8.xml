<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT PDT SUNDAY NIGHT...
Oregon Department of Environmental Quality has issued an Air
Pollution Advisory...in effect until midnight PDT Sunday night.
Wildfires burning in the region combined with forecast conditions
will cause air quality levels to fluctuate and could be at unhealthy
levels.
The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality issued an air quality
advisory for western Curry County near Port Orford due to smoke from
the Anvil fires. This has been expanded to include Jackson and
Josephine Counties due to smoke from fires in northern California.
DEQ also expects intermittent smoke for other areas of southern
Oregon, including central Douglas County, southern Coos, and Klamath
counties.
Smoke levels can change rapidly depending on weather. Smoke can
irritate the eyes and lungs and worsen some medical conditions.
People most at risk include infants and young children, people with
heart or lung disease, older adults and pregnant people.
Keep windows and doors closed. If itâ€™s too hot, run air conditioning
on recirculate or consider moving to a cooler location. Avoid
strenuous outdoor activity. Use high- efficiency particulate air
(HEPA) filters in indoor ventilation systems or portable air
purifiers. Be aware of smoke in your area and avoid places with the
highest levels. When air quality improves to moderate or healthy,
open windows and doors to air out homes and businesses. If you have a
breathing plan for a medical condition, be sure to follow it and
keep any needed medications refilled.
