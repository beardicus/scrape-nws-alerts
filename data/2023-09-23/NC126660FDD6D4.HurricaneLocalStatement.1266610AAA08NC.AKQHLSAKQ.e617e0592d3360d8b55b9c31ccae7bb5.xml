SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Ophelia continues to track northward near the Virginia
North Carolina border early this evening. Ophelia will weaken as it
continues to track northward across eastern Virginia tonight before
becoming extratropical by Sunday morning.
Impacts from Ophelia will continue, which include:
* Dangerous marine and high surf - Dangerous marine conditions are
expected to continue due to the strong winds and high seas. Seas will
remain elevated into Sunday. A high risk for rip currents will
continue through the remainder of the weekend.
* Heavy Rain - heavy downpours will continue to cause localized
flooding of roads and low-lying areas, especially across central and
eastern Virginia.
* Winds - Tropical Storm force wind gusts will continue to impact
northeast North Carolina, east-central Virginia and the lower eastern
shore through late this evening or tonight. These strong winds will
have the potential to cause areas of downed trees and power outages.
* Coastal Flooding - Areas of moderate to major coastal flooding are
expected during the high tide cycle this evening.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
CENTRAL AND EASTERN VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST NORTH CAROLINA...AND THE
LOWER MARYLAND EASTERN SHORE. Remain well sheltered from hazardous
wind having limited impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, especially if soils are saturated. Some roadway signs
will sustain damage.
- A few roads will be impassable from debris. Hazardous driving
conditions on bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across
EASTERN VIRGINIA. Remain well away from life- threatening surge having
significant impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Severe storm surge flooding will likely cause inundation of
numerous roads and buildings, resulting in a threat to life and
property. Flooding will likely extend inland from the
waterfront and shoreline flooding homes, businesses and
isolating some neighborhoods. Large breaking waves will result
in additional damage near the shoreline.
- Numerous roads flooded or washed out.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching some dunes.
- Severe damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers is
expected. Small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected marinas and docks.
Potential impacts from the main surge event are also now unfolding
across NORTHEAST NORTH CAROLINA...EASTERN VIRGINIA...AND THE MARYLAND
EASTERN SHORE. Remain well away from locally hazardous surge having
limited impacts.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
CENTRAL AND EASTERN VIRGINIA. Remain well guarded against life-
threatening flood waters having extensive impacts. If realized, these
impacts include:
- Evacuations and rescues likely due to flooding from heavy
rainfall
- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Small streams, creeks, and ditches may become
dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and barriers may become
overwhelmed.
- Flood waters enter structures within multiple communities, with
some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed away. Some
escape routes inundated by flood waters. Streets, parking lots
and underpasses could be submerged, with driving conditions
quickly becoming dangerous. Numerous road and bridge closures
are expected with some becoming weakened or washed out.
* TORNADOES:
Potential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across THE LOWER
MARYLAND EASTERN SHORE. Remain well braced against a tornado event
having limited impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- A few tornadoes are expected. As a result, execution of
emergency plans could be hindered in affected areas.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Roofs peeled off some buildings. A few chimneys toppled and
mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned. Large tree
tops and branches snapped off, with some trees knocked over. A
few vehicles blown off roads.
Elsewhere across CENTRAL AND EASTERN VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST NORTH
CAROLINA...AND THE LOWER MARYLAND EASTERN SHORE, little to no impact
is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Do not enter evacuated areas until officials have given the all clear
to return.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to stay inside and away from windows. Listen for
updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Keep a battery-
powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.
Keep your cell phone charged and in power-saving mode. If you lose
power, use it sparingly and mainly for personal emergencies and
check-ins.
Do not be a thrill seeker or risk your life for senseless photos or
videos.
If you are prone to flooding or in an area under a storm surge watch
or warning, be prepared for the possibility of a quick and dramatic
rise in water levels.
