NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Calvert and St. Marys
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 150 miles south of Washington DC or about 180 miles
south-southwest of Baltimore MD
- 36.8N 77.3W
- Storm Intensity 40 mph
- Movement North or 360 degrees at 12 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Ophelia will move north-northeast up the I-95 corridor
through Sunday.
Storm surge is expected to be the main threat to our area, especially
along the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay and the tidal Potomac
River where inundation of 1 to 3 feet is expected. In particular, St.
Mary`s County could see significant impacts from surge where 2 to
3 feet of inundation is likely. The highest water levels will be
around high tides through early Sunday morning.
Widespread additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches are expected,
with localized amounts up to 4 inches possible. This may result in
isolated instances of flooding, especially for low-lying and flood
prone areas. The heaviest rain is most likely to occur through early
Sunday morning.
Tropical storm force wind gusts, likely between 40 and 55 mph, are
expected over southern Maryland and the nearby waters south of North
Beach MD along the Chesapeake Bay, and southeast of Cobb Island MD
along the tidal Potomac River. The strongest winds will persist
through this evening. Gusty winds and a saturated ground will likely
cause downed trees and power outages, especially along the immediate
western shoreline of the Chesapeake Bay.
While the severe weather threat is low, a brief tornado or two cannot
out be ruled out across southern Maryland through this evening.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Potential significant impacts from the main surge event are unfolding
along the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay and tidal Potomac River.
If realized, these impacts include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread
with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where
surge water covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are unfolding. If realized,
these impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals,
arroyos, and ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
southern Maryland. Remain well guarded against locally hazardous flood
waters having possible elevated impacts.
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are unfolding. If realized,
these impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* TORNADOES:
Potential impacts from tornadoes are unfolding. If realized, these
impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned, large
tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees knocked
over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats pulled
from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
For those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,
falling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move,
relocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help keep
roadways open for those under evacuation orders.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to stay inside and away from windows. Listen for
updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Keep a battery-
powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.
Keep your cell phone charged and in power-saving mode. If you lose
power, use it sparingly and mainly for personal emergencies and
check-ins.
