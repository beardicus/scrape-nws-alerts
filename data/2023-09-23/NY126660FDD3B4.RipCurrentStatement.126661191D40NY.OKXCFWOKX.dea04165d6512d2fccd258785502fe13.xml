<headline>Rip Current Statement issued September 23 at 5:17PM EDT until September 24 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT SUNDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY HAS EXPIRED...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 6
to 9 feet in the surf zone. For the High Rip Current Risk,
dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Southern Queens and Southern Nassau Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT Sunday. For
the High Rip Current Risk, through Sunday evening.
* BEACH EROSION AND FLOODING IMPACTS...Large breaking waves of 5
to 10 ft will cause beach flooding and erosion, with scattered
areas of dune erosion during the time of high tide. The
potential for localized overwashes is low at this time,
relegated to the most compromised dune areas.
* SWIMMING IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions.
Life- threatening rip currents are likely for all people entering
the surf zone. Anyone visiting the beaches should stay out of the
surf. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore
into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Additional rounds of minor coastal
flooding are possible Sunday into early next week, particularly
during the afternoon high tide.</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
