<description>...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT SUNDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Statement, reports of minor to
localized moderate flooding at the Riverhead tidal gauge
this evening indicate 1 to 2 of inundation above ground level.
High tide has passed and water levels will slowly subside the
next couple of hours. This will result in mainly minor flooding
in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline. For the
High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 6 to 10 feet in the
surf zone. For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Southeast Suffolk County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Statement, until 10 PM EDT this
evening. For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT Sunday.
For the High Rip Current Risk, through Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...Some water on low lying roads and property.
Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach
erosion. Life- threatening rip currents are likely for all
people entering the surf zone. Anyone visiting the beaches
should stay out of the surf. Rip currents can sweep even the
best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* BEACH EROSION AND FLOODING IMPACTS...Large breaking waves of 6
to 10 ft will cause beach flooding and erosion, with scattered
areas of dune erosion during the time of high tide. The
potential for localized overwashes is low at this time,
limited to the most compromised dune areas.
* SWIMMING IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents are likely for all people
entering the surf zone. Anyone visiting the beaches should
stay out of the surf. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Additional rounds of minor coastal
flooding are possible Sunday into early next week, particularly
during the afternoon/evening high tide.</description>
<instruction>Do not drive through flooded roadways.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
