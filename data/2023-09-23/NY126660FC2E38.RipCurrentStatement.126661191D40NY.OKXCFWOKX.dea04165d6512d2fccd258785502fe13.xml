<headline>Rip Current Statement issued September 23 at 6:38AM EDT until September 24 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT SUNDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM TO 5 PM EDT
THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 5 to 10
feet expected in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood
Advisory, up to one half foot of inundation above ground level
expected in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...Southern Queens and Southern Nassau Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT Sunday. For
the High Rip Current Risk, through Sunday evening. For the
Coastal Flood Advisory, from 1 PM to 5 PM EDT this afternoon.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Minor flooding is expected in
vulnerable locations near the waterfront and shoreline. As
much as 1 ft of inundation above ground level, which will
cause shallow flooding on some roads and low lying property
including parking lots, parks, lawns and homes/businesses with
basements near the waterfront.
* BEACH EROSION AND FLOODING IMPACTS...Large breaking waves of 5
to 10 ft will cause beach flooding and erosion, with scattered
areas of dune erosion during the time of high tide. The
potential for localized overwashes is low at this time,
relegated to the most compromised dune areas.
* SWIMMING IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions
and localized beach erosion. Life- threatening rip currents
are likely for all people entering the surf zone. Anyone
visiting the beaches should stay out of the surf. Rip currents
can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper
water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Additional rounds of minor coastal
flooding are possible Sunday into early next week, particularly
during the afternoon high tide.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
