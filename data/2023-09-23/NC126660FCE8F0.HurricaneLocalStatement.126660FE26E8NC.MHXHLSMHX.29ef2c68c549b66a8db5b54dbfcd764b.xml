SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Ophelia made landfall near Emerald Isle, NC earlier
this morning. Moderate to locally significant impacts will continue
across eastern North Carolina, with the greatest impacts along the
coast.
Along the coast, life threatening storm surge with inundation 2 to 4
feet above ground level is expected today. Additionally, up to 3 to
5 feet of storm surge is possible across the lower Pamlico and Neuse
Rivers through late morning. There remains potential for at least
minor overwash also along the Outer Banks through the weekend.
Finally, we continue to monitor the potential for rapid water level
rises across the soundside Outer Banks today and into tonight when
the winds shift.
Tropical storm force winds will continue this morning, slowly
improving late this afternoon and evening. These strong winds will
have the potential to cause areas of tree damage and power outages.
Heavy rain will bring additional rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches,
with isolated amounts up to 6 inches, with the axis of heavier rain
shifting more. This will bring the threat of localized flash
flooding especially in low-lying, urban, and poor drainage areas.
Dangerous marine conditions will continue for all coastal waters,
sounds and rivers, with strong winds and dangerous seas. This will
create treacherous conditions for mariners. Localized ocean overwash
is expected along the coast due to high surf. Stronger and more
frequent rip currents will also exist along area beaches through the
weekend.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across
coastal North Carolina north of Surf City. Remain well away from
life-threatening surge having additional significant impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
Elsewhere across Eastern North Carolina, little to no impact is
anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
eastern North Carolina. Remain well guarded against life-threatening
flood waters having possible extensive impacts. If realized, these
impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may
become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and barriers may
become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.
Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with
underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.
Many road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
Greenville. Remain well guarded against dangerous
flood waters having additional significant impacts.
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
eastern North Carolina. Remain well sheltered from dangerous wind
having possible significant impacts. If realized, these impacts
include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
Potential impacts from the main wind event are also now unfolding
across the Outer Banks. Remain well sheltered from
hazardous wind having possible limited impacts.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Keep your cell phone charged and in power-saving mode. If you lose
power, use it sparingly and mainly for personal emergencies and
check-ins.
If you are prone to flooding or in an area under a storm surge watch
or warning, be prepared for the possibility of a quick and dramatic
rise in water levels.
