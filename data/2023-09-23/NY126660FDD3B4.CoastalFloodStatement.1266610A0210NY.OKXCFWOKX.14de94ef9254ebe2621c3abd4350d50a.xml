<headline>Coastal Flood Statement issued September 23 at 5:17PM EDT until September 23 at 9:00PM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT SUNDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 6
to 11 feet in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Statement,
up to one half foot of inundation above ground level in
vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline. For the
High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Southwest Suffolk and Southeast Suffolk Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT Sunday. For
the Coastal Flood Statement, until 9 PM EDT this evening. For
the High Rip Current Risk, through Sunday evening.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Brief minor flooding of the most
vulnerable locations near the waterfront and shoreline during
the time of high tide.
* BEACH EROSION AND FLOODING IMPACTS...Large breaking waves of 6
to 10 ft will cause beach flooding and erosion, with scattered
areas of dune erosion during the time of high tide. The
potential for localized overwashes is low at this time,
relegated to the most compromised dune areas.
* SWIMMING IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions
and localized beach erosion. Life- threatening rip currents
are likely for all people entering the surf zone. Anyone
visiting the beaches should stay out of the surf. Rip currents
can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper
water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Additional rounds of minor coastal
flooding are possible Sunday into early next week, particularly
during the afternoon high tide.</description>
<instruction>Do not drive through flooded roadways.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
