SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Ophelia will make landfall shortly along the coast of
North Carolina early this morning, and then lift north across eastern
North Carolina and eastern Virginia later this morning into early
Sunday.
Regardless of the exact track, Ophelia is expected to bring a myriad
of hazards to our area through early Sunday. These impacts include:
* Dangerous marine and high surf - Dangerous marine conditions are
expected late tonight into Saturday due to the strong winds and high
seas. Seas of 12 to 16 feet are expected today and remain elevated
into Sunday. Large breaking waves of 6 to 10 ft will result in
dangerous surf conditions and a high risk for rip currents.
* Heavy Rain - heavy downpours could cause localized minor flooding
of roads and low-lying areas, especially across northeast north
Carolina, eastern and central Virginia, and the lower eastern
shore of Maryland and Virginia.
* Winds - Tropical Storm force winds will continue to impact northeast
North Carolina, east-central Virginia and the lower eastern shore
through this evening. These strong winds will have the potential to
cause areas of downed trees and power outages.
* Coastal Flooding - Areas of moderate to major coastal flooding are
possible during high tide cycles through this evening.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
EASTERN VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST NORTH CAROLINA...AND THE LOWER MARYLAND
EASTERN SHORE. Remain well sheltered from hazardous wind having
limited impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, especially if soils are saturated. Some roadway signs
will sustain damage.
- A few roads will be impassable from debris. Hazardous driving
conditions on bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across
coastal northeast North Carolina and eastern Virginia. Remain well
away from life-threatening surge having significant impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- Severe storm surge flooding will likely cause inundation of
numerous roads and buildings, resulting in a threat to life and
property. Flooding will likely extend inland from the
waterfront and shoreline flooding homes, businesses and
isolating some neighborhoods. Large breaking waves will result
in additional damage near the shoreline.
- Numerous roads flooded or washed out.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching some dunes.
- Severe damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers is
expected. Small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected marinas and docks.
Potential impacts from the main surge event are also now unfolding
across EASTERN VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST NORTH CAROLINA...AND THE LOWER
MARYLAND EASTERN SHORE. Remain well away from locally hazardous surge.
Elsewhere across CENTRAL AND EASTERN VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST NORTH
CAROLINA...AND THE LOWER MARYLAND EASTERN SHORE, little to no impact
is anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
central and eastern Virginia, northeast North Carolina and the lower
eastern shore of Maryland and Virginia. Remain well guarded against
life-threatening flood waters having extensive impacts. If realized,
these impacts include:
- Evacuations and rescues likely due to flooding from heavy
rainfall
- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Small streams, creeks, and ditches may become
dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and barriers may become
overwhelmed.
- Flood waters enter structures within multiple communities, with
some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed away. Some
escape routes inundated by flood waters. Streets, parking lots
and underpasses could be submerged, with driving conditions
quickly becoming dangerous. Numerous road and bridge closures
are expected with some becoming weakened or washed out.
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
CENTRAL AND EASTERN VIRGINIA. Remain well guarded against dangerous
flood waters having possible significant impacts.
* TORNADOES:
Potential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across CENTRAL AND
EASTERN VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST NORTH CAROLINA...AND THE LOWER MARYLAND
EASTERN SHORE. Remain well braced against a tornado event having
possible limited impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- A few tornadoes are expected. As a result, execution of
emergency plans could be hindered in affected areas.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Roofs peeled off some buildings. A few chimneys toppled and
mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned. Large tree
tops and branches snapped off, with some trees knocked over. A
few vehicles blown off roads.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Do not enter evacuated areas until officials have given the all clear
to return.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to stay inside and away from windows. Listen for
updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Keep a battery-
powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.
Keep your cell phone charged and in power-saving mode. If you lose
power, use it sparingly and mainly for personal emergencies and
check-ins.
Do not be a thrill seeker or risk your life for senseless photos or
videos.
If you are prone to flooding or in an area under a storm surge watch
or warning, be prepared for the possibility of a quick and dramatic
rise in water levels.
