SITUATION OVERVIEW

Tidal flooding and flooding from heavy rain remain threats through
Sunday. Please consult Flood and Coastal Flood alerts for more
information.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Potential significant impacts from the main surge event are ongoing
along the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay and tidal Potomac River.
If realized, these impacts include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread
with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where
surge water covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Additional impacts from flooding rain are still a concern. Remain well
guarded against locally hazardous flood waters having further impacts
of elevated potential.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
Allow extra time for emergency vehicles to reach you as they navigate
road hazards.
When clearing out fallen trees, be careful with chainsaws and axes.
Always wear protective gear and keep others at a safe distance.
Leaning trees and those which have fallen on roofs or power lines can
be especially dangerous. If you are not in good health or unsure
about what you are doing, have someone with tree cutting experience
do the job. Never cut trees without a partner.
If using a generator, avoid carbon monoxide poisoning by following
instructions provided by the manufacturer. Operate your generator in
a well-ventilated space outside of your living area and away from
open doors and windows.
Be alert for any lingering wind gusts which could take down weakened
trees and/or power lines.
Be alert for potential flooding from rising rivers and streams which
may have yet to crest. Remain informed of the latest river forecasts
and heed any flood watches and warnings.
