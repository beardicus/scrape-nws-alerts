SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Ophelia made landfall near Emerald Isle, North Carolina
earlier this morning. All flooding rain and storm surge threats have
ceased across the area. Gusty winds will continue into this afternoon,
but are now below tropical storm force. Dangerous surf and an elevated
risk of rip currents will continue, particularly north of Cape Fear.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time across southeast
North Carolina and northeast South Carolina.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
If your home or shelter was damaged, be alert to the smell of natural
gas leaks and cautious around exposed electrical wiring, broken glass,
jagged metal and wood, and protruding nails and screws.
Check to see if everyone in your group is OK. Administer first aid to
those who are injured. Call 9 1 1 for any serious injuries. Remember,
it may be more difficult for emergency responders to arrive quickly
in the time period immediately following the storm.
When clearing out fallen trees, be careful with chain saws and axes.
Always wear protective gear and keep others at a safe distance. Use
these tools according to operating manuals and safety instruction.
Leaning trees and those which have fallen on roof tops can be
especially challenging. If you are not in good health or unsure about
what you are doing, have someone else with tree cutting experience do
the job. Never cut trees without a partner.
