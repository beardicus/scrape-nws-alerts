<headline>High Surf Advisory issued September 23 at 5:13AM EDT until September 24 at 4:00AM EDT by NWS Philadelphia - Mount Holly</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM EDT SUNDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO
8 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of up to 10
feet expected in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Warning,
one to three feet of inundation above ground level expected in
low- lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...Delaware Beaches.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Sunday evening.
For the High Surf Advisory, until 4 AM EDT Sunday. For the
Coastal Flood Warning, from noon today to 8 PM EDT this
evening.
* IMPACTS...At this level, widespread roadway flooding occurs in
coastal and bayside communities and along inland tidal
waterways. Many roads become impassable. Some damage to
vulnerable structures may begin to occur. Dangerous swimming
and surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...With the long duration of onshore winds
expected, the back bays may struggle to drain during low tide.
This could result in minor to moderate coastal flooding
lingering after high tide. Additionally, minor flooding is
possible again with the Sunday afternoon high tide.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
