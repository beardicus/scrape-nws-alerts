SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Ophelia is now lifting into southern Virginia, and it
will move slowly northeastward into the Delmarva region on Sunday. The
threat of tropical storm winds across central NC has ended. Only minor
flooding rain impacts are possible this evening in the northeast
Piedmont and northern Coastal Plain as some light to moderate rain
persists and flooding lingers from heavy rain that fell earlier. All
rain will lift north of the region tonight.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Additional impacts from flooding rain are still a concern across the
northeast Piedmont and northern Coastal Plain. Remain well guarded
against locally hazardous flood waters having further impacts of
limited potential.
Elsewhere across central North Carolina, little to no impact is
anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
When clearing out fallen trees, be careful with chainsaws and axes.
Always wear protective gear and keep others at a safe distance. Leaning
trees and those which have fallen on roofs or power lines can be
especially dangerous. If you are not in good health or unsure about
what you are doing, have someone with tree cutting experience do the
job. Never cut trees without a partner.
Be alert for potential flooding from rising rivers and streams which
may have yet to crest. Remain informed of the latest river forecasts
and heed any flood watches and warnings.
Be alert for flooded roads which could be compromised or littered
with debris. Avoid travel until water levels subside and roads have
been cleared. Do not drive through places where flood waters cover
the road. Turn around, don`t drown!
