<headline>Flood Watch issued June 10 at 8:42AM AKDT  by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Rivers draining the southeastern Brooks Range. This
includes the middle fork of the Koyukuk River.
* WHEN...Through Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...Runoff from rainfall and remaining snowmelt has caused
rivers draining the southeastern Brooks Range to rise to near
bankfull in many locations, with water over bank in some low lying
areas. Minor flooding is occurring on Slate Creek at Coldfoot.
Water is approaching the road into the community of Wiseman. Water
levels will continue to rise into the weekend, possibly causing
minor flooding in some locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The high water will cover gravel bars and push water up into
the brush line. An increased amount of debris will flow down
rivers.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
