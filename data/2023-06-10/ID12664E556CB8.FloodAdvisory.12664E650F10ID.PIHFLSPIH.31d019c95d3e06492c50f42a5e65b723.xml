<description>...The National Weather Service in Pocatello has issued a Flood
Advisory for the following rivers in Idaho...

.Heavy, recent rainfall combined with high mountain snow have caused
high inflows into the Mackay reservoir, which is prompting high
releases downstream of the reservoir.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov/pocatello.

NOTICE...
