        <headline>Air Quality Alert issued March 27 at 4:31PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg SC</headline>
        <description>The South Carolina Department of Environmental Services in Columbia
SC has issued an Air Quality Alert for Fine Particulates for the
Greenville mountains of South Carolina, until midnight EDT tonight.
An Air Quality Alert means that fine particulate concentrations within
the specified areas may approach or exceed unhealthy standards due to
local wildfire smoke, mainly along and north of SC Hwy 11.

High pressure drifting east off the Southeast U.S. coast will continue
to dominate the region through Friday, minimizing smoke dispersion from
the Table Rock wildfire in Pickens County and the Persimmon Ridge wildfire
in Greenville County. Stable conditions and light westerly winds overnight
and early Friday morning along the mountains of South Carolina will enhance
the appearance of smoke in the mountainous areas of Greenville County.
Increasing southwesterly winds during the late morning and latter half
of Friday will continue to disperse and transport the smoke into the
mountainous portion of Greenville County, as well as into North Carolina.

SCDES recommends that individuals with respiratory health issues limit
time spent outdoors and/or move all activities indoors to avoid the smoke
or fine particulates. Keep windows and doors closed. Run an air conditioner
if you have one but keep the fresh-air intake closed and the filter clean
to prevent outdoor smoke and fine particulates from getting inside. Please
note that locations closest to the wildfire activity are more likely to
experience smoke at any given time. Anytime you see or smell smoke, take
necessary precautions.
