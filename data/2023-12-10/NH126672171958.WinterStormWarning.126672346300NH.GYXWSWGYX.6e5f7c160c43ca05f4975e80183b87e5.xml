<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued December 10 at 3:06AM EST until December 11 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM TONIGHT AND MONDAY...
.Rain will transition to heavy wet snow after midnight tonight and
continue through much of Monday. Snowfall rates of between 1-2&quot;/hr
are possible during the Monday morning commute, making travel very
difficult. Power outages are possible due to the expected heavy
nature of the snow.
...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM TO 7 PM EST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation expected. Total snow
accumulations between 4 and 12 inches, sleet accumulations up to
one tenth of an inch, and ice accumulations around a light glaze.
Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Northern Coos County.
* WHEN...From 1 AM to 7 PM EST Monday.
* IMPACTS...A snowstorm will bring plowable snow to the region with
a period of moderate travel impacts expected. Periods of moderate
snow and low visibility will be the biggest hazards. Heavy wet
snow will cause weighted tree limbs of conifers and leafed trees,
leading to snapped branches and downed trees. Power outages are
possible. Significant snowfall and periods of heavy snowfall rates
will combine with low visibility to create very dangerous driving
conditions. The hazardous conditions could impact the Monday
morning and evening commutes.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road conditions can
be obtained by going to newengland511.org
Do not touch downed lines and report any power outages to your
electric company. Travel is highly discouraged due to slick roadways
and the possibility of downed trees and power lines.</instruction>
