<headline>Flood Watch issued December 10 at 3:23PM AKST until December 13 at 9:00AM AKST by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...The following areas, Prince of Wales, Southern Inner
Channels, Central Inner Channels and Eastern Gulf Coast. This
includes the cities of Gustavus, Hoonah, Tenakee Springs, Elfin
Cove, Pelican, Sitka, Angoon, Juneau, Petersburg, Kake, Port
Alexander, Craig, Klawock, Hydaburg, Coffman Cove, Thorne Bay,
Wrangell, Ketchikan, And Metlakatla.
* WHEN...From late Monday night through Wednesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, other low-lying areas and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Historically, we
note possible isolated landslides can occur from similar
atmospheric conditions in areas of steep terrain. Annual return
intervals continue to show a 10 to 25 year returns for Tuesday
into Wednesday.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A series of warm fronts will approach the area for the start
of the week bringing more rain to the panhandle. These warm
fronts will bring moisture from an atmospheric river to the
area while also warming temperatures and raising snow levels.
With the rain and warming temperatures, snow melt is expected
across the panhandle for lower elevation basins which will
add to the significant rain falling across the panhandle.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.
Stay tuned to further developments by listening to your local radio,
television, or NOAA Weather Radio for further information.</instruction>
