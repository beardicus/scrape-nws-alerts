<headline>Blizzard Warning issued December 10 at 4:13PM AKST until December 11 at 5:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 AM AKST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions and heavy snow. Visibility reduced to
one quarter mile. Additional snow accumulations of 3 to 9
inches, with local amounts up to 12 inches possible. Highest
snow amounts over interior Bristol Bay, including Koliganek and
New Stuyahok. Northerly winds gusting 35 to 45 mph.
* WHERE...Bristol Bay.
* WHEN...Until 5 AM AKST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be difficult. Blowing snow and heavy
snow will produce white-out conditions at times.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Dillingham is located along the west of the
heaviest snow, which will lead to snowfall amounts on the lower
end of the range, with additional accumulations around 3 inches.
However, blizzard conditions are likely to continue to be
observed there, despite the lower snowfall rates. Snow spreads
north to Iliamna this evening. Snowfall rates and winds will
diminish Monday morning, allowing visibility to improve.</description>
<instruction>A Blizzard Warning means severe winter weather conditions are
expected or occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds
and poor visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout
conditions, making travel very hazardous. If you must travel,
have a winter survival kit with you.If you get stranded, stay
with your vehicle.</instruction>
