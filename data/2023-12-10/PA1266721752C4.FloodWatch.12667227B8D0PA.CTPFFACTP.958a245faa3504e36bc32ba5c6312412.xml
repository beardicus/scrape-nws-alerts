<headline>Flood Watch issued December 10 at 4:53AM EST until December 11 at 12:00PM EST by NWS State College</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM EST THIS AFTERNOON
THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of central Pennsylvania, including the following
county, Schuylkill.
* WHEN...From 1 PM EST this afternoon through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- With generally dry soil conditions and near to below average
streamflows over east-central Pennsylvania, rainfall will be
largely beneficial in nature. However, with isolated rainfall
totals up to 2.5 inches expected, there may be some localized
flooding. The threat of flash flooding is low given modest
rainfall rates less than 1 inch per hour, but isolated urban,
poor drainage, and small stream flooding is possible.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
