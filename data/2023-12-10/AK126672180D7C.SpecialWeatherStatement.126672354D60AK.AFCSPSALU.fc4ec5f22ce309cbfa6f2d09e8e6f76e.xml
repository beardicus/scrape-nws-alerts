<headline>Special Weather Statement issued December 10 at 5:31AM AKST  by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>Gusty northerly winds will increase in coverage across the
Kuskokwim Delta on Sunday with periods of blowing snow and reduced
visibility anticipated. The strongest winds, initially along the
coast this morning, are expected to expand north and east through
tonight. Wind gusts are forecast to range anywhere from 35 mph to
as high as 45 mph in some areas. Despite no precipitation,
transportable snow, already on the ground, will become lofted
quite easily. Thus, periods of blowing snow will lead to
subsequent periods of reduced visibility down to a half mile at
times. Winds will briefly taper off from east to west by midday on
Monday. Much of the transportable snow will have been moved and
the threat for more significant blowing snow will come to an end.</description>
