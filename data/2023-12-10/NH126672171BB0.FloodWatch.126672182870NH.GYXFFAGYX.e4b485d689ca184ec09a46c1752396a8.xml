<headline>Flood Watch issued December 10 at 3:12AM EST until December 10 at 10:00AM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>.A potent storm system will bring widespread moderate to heavy
rainfall into western Maine and New Hampshire tonight into Monday.
Rainfall of 2 to 3 inches with some locally higher amounts are
possible. This will combine with melting snow and partially frozen
ground to cause flooding. Flooding along mainstem rivers is also
possible. The
widespread rainfall will likely cause travel disruptions from
flooded roads, and possibly property damage near rivers.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 3 PM EST THIS AFTERNOON
THROUGH MONDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Maine, including the following areas,
Androscoggin, Central Interior Cumberland, Central Somerset,
Coastal Cumberland, Coastal Waldo, Coastal York, Interior
Cumberland Highlands, Interior Waldo, Interior York, Kennebec,
Knox, Lincoln, Northern Franklin, Northern Oxford, Sagadahoc,
Southern Franklin, Southern Oxford and Southern Somerset and New
Hampshire, including the following areas, Belknap, Cheshire,
Coastal Rockingham, Eastern Hillsborough, Interior Rockingham,
Merrimack, Northern Carroll, Southern Carroll, Southern Grafton,
Strafford, Sullivan and Western And Central Hillsborough.
* WHEN...From 3 PM EST this afternoon through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Heavy rainfall along with warm temperatures will cause
melting of the snow pack from the foothills southward. This
will increase the runoff into streams and rivers. Moderate to
heavy rainfall over partially frozen ground will support the
potential for flash flooding as well as river flooding.
Disruptions to travel are likely on Monday</description>
<instruction>You should monitor the latest forecast and be alert for possible
