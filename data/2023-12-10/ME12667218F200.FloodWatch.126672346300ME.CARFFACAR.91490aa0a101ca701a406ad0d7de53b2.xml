<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM EST MONDAY THROUGH
TUESDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of Far Northern Maine, including the following
area, Northeast Aroostook.
* WHEN...From 1 AM EST Monday through Tuesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Flooding caused by a combination of rain and snow melt
continues to be possible.  Heavy rainfall combined with warm
temperatures will melt most, if not all snow. The heavy rain,
snowmelt, and high rainfall rates over a partially frozen
ground will create a scenario promoting small stream, creek
and river flooding.
