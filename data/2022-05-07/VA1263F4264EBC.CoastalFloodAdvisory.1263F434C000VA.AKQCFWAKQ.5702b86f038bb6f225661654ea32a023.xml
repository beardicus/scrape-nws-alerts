<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued May 07 at 5:35PM EDT until May 08 at 12:00PM EDT by NWS Wakefield</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM EDT TUESDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT TONIGHT TO NOON
EDT SUNDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM NOON SUNDAY TO 6 AM EDT
TUESDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, two to three feet of
inundation above ground level expected in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways. For the High Surf Advisory,
large breaking waves of 8 to 13 feet in the surf zone. For the
Coastal Flood Advisory, one to two feet of inundation above
ground level expected in low-lying areas near shorelines and
tidal waterways.
* WHERE...Northampton County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, from noon Sunday to 6 AM
EDT Tuesday. For the High Surf Advisory, until 6 AM EDT
Tuesday. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from midnight tonight
to noon EDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Widespread flooding of vulnerable areas will result in an
elevated threat of property damage to homes and businesses near the
waterfront and shoreline. Water will be 1 foot above ground level
tonight and up to 2 to 3 ft above ground level in some areas Sunday
afternoon through Tuesday morning. This will result in a sufficient
depth to close numerous roads and threaten homes and businesses.
Flooding will extend inland from the waterfront along tidal rivers
and bays resulting in some road closures and flooding of vehicles.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...This will be a long duration event with
conditions deteriorating Sunday afternoon and peaking Monday into
Tuesday, then gradually improving later in the week. The greatest
threat of ocean overwash and inundation will occur around the times
of high tide. Dune erosion will be progressive and overwash will
likely be worse with each successive high tide.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
