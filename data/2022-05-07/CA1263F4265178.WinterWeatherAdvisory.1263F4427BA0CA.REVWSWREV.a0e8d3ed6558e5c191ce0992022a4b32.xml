<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued May 07 at 2:42PM PDT until May 08 at 11:00PM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM TO 11 PM PDT
SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Snow and gusty winds expected. Total snow accumulations
of 5 to 10 inches along the Sierra crest including Donner and
Echo Summits, except 1 to 5 inches below 7,000 feet with the
higher amounts on the west shore of Lake Tahoe. Sustained winds
of 20 to 30 mph with gusts to 55 mph and waves of 2 to to 4
feet on Lake Tahoe. Ridgetop winds up to 110 mph expected.
* WHERE...Greater Lake Tahoe Area.
* WHEN...From 11 AM to 11 PM PDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Strong winds could
cause tree damage.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most likely time for accumulating
snowfall is during the evening hours on Sunday. However, any
convective snow showers may produce heavy enough snowfall rates
to result in an earlier onset for accumulation on the roads.
Check with CalTrans for the latest road conditions.</description>
<instruction>Even light snowfall causes major travel delays, especially during
periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to
reach your destination. Leave extra space between vehicles since
it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
