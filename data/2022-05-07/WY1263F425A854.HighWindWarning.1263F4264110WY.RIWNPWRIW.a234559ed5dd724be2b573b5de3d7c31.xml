<headline>High Wind Warning issued May 07 at 11:09AM MDT until May 07 at 3:00PM MDT by NWS Riverton</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 PM MDT THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...West winds 30 to 45 mph with gusts 60 TO 75 mph. A wind
gust to 77 mph occurred at the Johnson County Airport in Buffalo
at 1050 AM.
* WHERE...Northeast Johnson County.
* WHEN...Until 3 PM MDT this afternoon. The strongest gusts are
expected until 1 PM.
* IMPACTS...Downslope wind off the east slope of the Bighorn Range
has generated damaging wind gusts capable of blowing down trees
and power lines. Travel will be difficult, especially for high
profile vehicles along I-90 from Buffalo north to the Sheridan
County line.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The strongest wind gusts are generally
confined to the immediate area around Buffalo, with speeds
decreasing to the east of town.</description>
<instruction>A downed power line would pose a threat to start a wildfire,
which would rapidly spread given the high wind. Be on alert!
People should avoid being outside in forested areas and around
trees and branches. If possible, remain in the lower levels of
your home during the windstorm, and avoid windows. Use caution if
you must drive.</instruction>
