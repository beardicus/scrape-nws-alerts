<instruction>Do not drive into flooded areas or go around barricades. Nearly two
feet of water will carry most vehicles away. Turn around, don`t
drown.
Flooding is occurring. Most flood related deaths occur in
automobiles. Do not attempt to cross water covered bridges, dips, or
low water crossings. Never try to cross a flowing stream, even a
small one, on foot. To escape rising water find another route over
higher ground.
