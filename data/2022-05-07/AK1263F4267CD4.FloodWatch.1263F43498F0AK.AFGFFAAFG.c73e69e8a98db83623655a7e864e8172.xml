<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues to be possible.
* WHERE...Yukon River at Eagle
* WHEN...Through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...The Yukon River may rise above the natural riverbank.
Ice jam flooding has high uncertainty. Impacts could range between
localized high water and severe flooding. Now is the the time to
take precautions. Where possible, move items to higher ground and
prepare your community for possible flooding.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The river observer in Eagle reported that the ice sheet in
town on the Yukon river is out with the river flowing. The
river has risen approximately seven feet over the past week.
Tributaries including the Fortymile River and Mission Creek
are running high. The Yukon River at Eagle ice sheet broke up
early this morning, but there is intact ice downstream that
could cause ice jams to form. Breakup on upriver tributaries
has been dynamic with ice jams forming and releasing.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
