<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT...
The following message is transmitted at the request of the New Mexico
Departments of Health and Environment.
* WHAT...Very hot, very dry and very windy conditions are expected
today and for the next few days with transport winds from the
southwest. As a result, blowing smoke and dust are expected to be
transported towards the northeast from active fires throughout this
period. Winds will diminish overnight but should remain elevated
enough to prevent smoke impacts in communities down-drainage of
large fires overnight.
* WHERE...Blowing smoke and dust are expected to impact areas across
much of Colfax, Los Alamos, Mora, southeast Rio Arriba, Sandoval,
San Miguel, Socorro, Santa Fe, and southern Taos counties during the
next 24 hours. This includes, but is not limited to, the following
communities: Espanola, La Cueva, Las Vegas, Los Alamos, Mora, Ocate,
Ohkay Owingeh, Pojoaque, Pueblo of Cochiti, Pueblo of Santa Clara,
Santa Fe, White Rock, and Socorro.
* WHEN...Remainder of this afternoon through noon MDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Those with conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and heart
disease will be especially vulnerable to impacts from poor air
quality, as will adults over age 65, young children, and pregnant
women if smoke concentrations become unhealthy.
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method available
at https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/IndoorQuality.html and
https://cv.nmhealth.org
New Mexicans will also need to take steps to keep their homes cool to
avoid heat-related illnesses. NMDOH offers tips here:
