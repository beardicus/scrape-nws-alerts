<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY
AFTERNOON THROUGH MONDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues to be possible.
* WHERE...Yukon River at Circle.
* WHEN...From Sunday afternoon through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...If ice jams form downstream of Circle, flooding could
result. If ice jams form upriver from Circle, water could rise
rapidly when the jams break.
Ice jam flooding has high uncertainty. Impacts could range between
localized high water and severe flooding. Now is the the time to
take precautions. Where possible, move items to higher ground and
prepare your community for possible flooding.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Ice has started moving in Eagle. The breakup front should
reach Circle within a few days. With tributaries running high
and competent ice in place, there is potential for ice jams
to form and cause flooding in Circle. Breakup on upriver
tributaries has been dynamic.

<instruction>Residents near the river in Circle should monitor conditions and take
the appropriate precautions to protect life and property. Water
levels can rise quickly when an ice jam occurs.</instruction>
