<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued May 07 at 8:27PM EDT until May 12 at 6:00AM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM EDT SUNDAY THROUGH
SUNDAY EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM SUNDAY TO
6 AM EDT THURSDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM SUNDAY TO 6 AM
EDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, 2 to 4 feet of inundation
above ground level expected in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking
waves of 10 to 15 feet expected in the surf zone. For the Beach
Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents, large breaking waves
expected, and strong longshore currents in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Oceanside Northern Outer Banks.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, from 2 PM Sunday to 6 AM
EDT Thursday. For the Beach Hazards Statement, from 8 AM EDT
Sunday through Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...Up to 2 to 4 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in some areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in a significant threat to life and property,
especially around the times of high tide. Numerous roads may be
closed. Low lying property including homes, businesses, and some
critical infrastructure will be inundated. Dangerous swimming
and surfing conditions and shoreline erosion will occur. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw a swimmer or
surfer head first into the bottom causing neck and back
injuries. Strong longshore currents will create dangerous
swimming conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...This will be a long duration event with
conditions deteriorating Sunday afternoon and peaking Monday
through Wednesday, then gradually improving late in the week.
The greatest threat of ocean overwash and inundation will occur
around the times of high tide. Dune erosion will be progressive
and overwash will likely be worse with each successive high
tide.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
