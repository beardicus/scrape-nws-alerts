<description>...HIGH STREAM AND RIVER LEVELS THROUGH THE WEEKEND...
More showers and thunderstorms will produce moderate to heavy rain
across portions of northeast Oregon and southeast Washington
today.   Rainfall amounts ranging from 0.25 to around .75 inch are
expected.
This will lead to continued high levels on the rivers and streams
across this area as well as ponding of water in low-lying area and
fields. In steep terrain locations, there will also be a risk of
small rock or mud slides.
The heaviest precipitation is expected to occur this afternoon and
evening with showers tapering off overnight. it will take some time
for all the water to reach streams with high water levels expected
into Sunday before beginning to recede.</description>
