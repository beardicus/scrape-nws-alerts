<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues to be possible.
* WHERE...Koyukuk River at Hughes
* WHEN...Through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...If ice jams form downstream of Hughes, flooding could
result. If the ice jams form upriver from Hughes, water could rise
rapidly when the jams break.
Ice jam flooding has high uncertainty. Impacts could range between
localized high water and severe flooding. Now is the the time to
take precautions. Where possible, move items to higher ground and
prepare your community for possible flooding.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Ice is running in Hughes, with competent ice downriver on the
Koyukuk. With the river near bankfull and ice bank-to-bank,
any ice jam that develops downstream will cause flooding in
Hughes.

<instruction>Residents near the river should monitor conditions and take the
appropriate precautions to protect life and property. Water levels
can rise quickly when an ice jam occurs</instruction>
