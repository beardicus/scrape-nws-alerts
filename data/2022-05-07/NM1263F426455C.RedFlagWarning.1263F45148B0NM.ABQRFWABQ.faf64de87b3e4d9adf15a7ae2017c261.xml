<headline>Red Flag Warning issued May 07 at 3:11PM MDT until May 09 at 9:00PM MDT by NWS Albuquerque</headline>
<description>...LONG DURATION RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FOR THE NORTHEAST
HIGHLANDS AS WELL AS THE SANDIA, MANZANO, AND GALLINAS MOUNTAINS
THROUGH 9 PM MDT MONDAY DUE TO VERY STRONG WINDS, SEVERAL HOURS
OF SINGLE DIGIT HUMIDITY, ABOVE AVERAGE WARMTH AS WELL AS A VERY
UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR ALL OTHER AREAS THROUGH
10 PM MDT TODAY, 10 AM TO 10 PM MDT SUNDAY, AND AGAIN FROM 9 AM TO
9 PM ON MONDAY DUE TO STRONG WINDS, LOW HUMIDITY, ABOVE AVERAGE
WARMTH AND A VERY UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
.An exceptionally dangerous and likely historic stretch of
critical to extreme fire weather conditions will persist through
the middle portion of next week. Widespread strong west-southwest
20-ft winds coupled with above normal warmth, several hours of
single digit RH and an unstable air mass is expected through
Monday. There is very high confidence in the potential for rapid
and erratic fire growth due to these environmental conditions. In
fact, given the severity of the weather pattern, critical fire
weather conditions will be a concern through Monday evening with
little or no break due to poor overnight humidity recoveries and
persistent strong winds.
...RED FLAG WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM MDT MONDAY...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IS CANCELLED...
The National Weather Service in Albuquerque has cancelled the
Fire Weather Watch.
* AREA AND TIMING...Northeast Highlands through 9 PM MDT Monday.
The most critical fire weather conditions will be during the
afternoon and early evening hours.
* 20 FOOT WINDS...Southwest 20 to 35 mph with gusts of 40 to 45
mph today. West-southwest winds 20 to 30 mph with potential
gusts of 40 to 60 mph tonight. Southwest winds of 25 to 40 mph
with occasional gusts of 45 to 55 mph on Sunday. Southwest winds
20 to 30 mph with gusts to 45 to 50 mph Monday.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...Ranging from 4 to 15 percent each day with
long duration single digit humidity. In addition, rather poor
overnight recoveries can be expected across the region.
* IMPACTS...Any fires that develop will likely spread very rapidly
and will be dangerously difficult to control. In addition, long
range spotting and extreme fire behavior is possible. Outdoor
burning should not be done.</description>
