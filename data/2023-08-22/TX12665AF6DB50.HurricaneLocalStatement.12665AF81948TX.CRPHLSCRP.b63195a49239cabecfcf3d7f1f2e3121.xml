SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Harold continues to move closer to the southern
Texas coast early this morning, with a few rain bands currently
transitioning across the Middle Texas Coastal Waters. This system is
is moving to the west-nothwest at around 18 mph, and is expected to
reach land by midday today. Observations from offshore marine buoys
are indicating sustained winds around 25-35 mph, with gusts to 40 mph.
Locally heavy rainfall, strong winds and hazardous coastal and marine
conditions remain the primary concerns with this system. The threats
include:
- Flash Flooding: Moderate threat of flash flooding mainly south and
west of I-37, especially in urban areas. Rainfall accumulations 3 to
5&quot; with locally up to 7&quot; through early Wednesday.
- Hazardous Seas: Wave heights 10 to 13 feet with occasionally up to
16 feet.
- Tornadoes: Isolated tornadoes are possible across South Texas,
especially in outer rain bands.
- Coastal Flooding: Moderate coastal flooding is expected with up to
3 ft of inundation possible across the Middle Texas Coast south of
Matagorda Bay.
- Rip Currents: High risk of rip currents across all of the Texas
Coast.
- Strong Winds: Tropical Storm force winds of sustained 40-50 mph with
gusts up to 60-70 mph are possible in the warned areas.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant
impacts across southern Brush Country and southern Coastal Bend.
Potential impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals, and
ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
Prepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across northern portions of the Brush Country and the
rest of the Coastal Plains.
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
South Texas. Potential impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
South Texas. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
* SURGE:
Prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited impacts
across the Middle Texas coast. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread
with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where
surge water covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
WATCH/WARNING PHASE - Listen to local officials for recommended
preparedness actions, including possible evacuation. If ordered to
evacuate, do so immediately.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
If you are a visitor, be sure to know the name of the city or town in
which you are staying and the name of the county or parish in which
it resides. Listen for these locations in local news updates. Pay
attention for instructions from local authorities.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
