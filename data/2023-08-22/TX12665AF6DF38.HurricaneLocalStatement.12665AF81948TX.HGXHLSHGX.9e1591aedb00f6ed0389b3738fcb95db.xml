**HAROLD HEADED FOR THE SOUTH TEXAS COAST**
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Coastal Jackson,
Coastal Matagorda, and Matagorda Islands
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 240 miles south of Galveston TX
- 25.8N 95.1W
- Storm Intensity 45 mph
- Movement West-northwest or 285 degrees at 18 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Harold, located about 240 miles south of Galveston
Texas, is moving towards the west-northwest at around 18 mph and
is expected to move inland over South Texas by midday today. The
maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph with higher gusts. Some
additional strengthening is possible before Tropical Storm Harold
reaches the Texas coast.
The primary threats will remain highest for marine interests on the
Gulf of Mexico below Freeport. Those around the Matagorda Bay are
still advised to be prepared for tropical storm conditions through
late this morning and be ready for any last-minute, unanticipated
changes to the forecast.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time across Southeast
Texas.
* SURGE:
Prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited impacts
across the Matagorda Bay area. Potential impacts in this area
include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread
with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where
surge water covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
Elsewhere across Southeast Texas, little to no impact is anticipated.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
the Matagorda Bay area. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
Elsewhere across Southeast Texas, little to no impact is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
For those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,
falling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move,
relocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate,
help keep roadways open for those under evacuation orders.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies
kit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your
home or business.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
When securing your property, outside preparations should be concluded
as soon as possible before conditions deteriorate. The onset of
strong gusty winds or flooding can cause certain preparedness
activities to become unsafe.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes
to the forecast.

NEXT UPDATE
-----------

Service in Houston/Galveston TX around 7 AM CDT, or sooner if
conditions warrant.</description>
