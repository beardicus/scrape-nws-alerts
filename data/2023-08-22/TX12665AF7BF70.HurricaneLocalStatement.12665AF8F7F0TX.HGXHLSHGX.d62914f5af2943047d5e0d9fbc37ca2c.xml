<description>This product covers Southeast Texas
**HAROLD MAKES LANDFALL ON PADRE ISLAND TEXAS**
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Coastal Jackson,
Coastal Matagorda, and Matagorda Islands
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 110 miles southwest of Port O`Connor TX
- 27.1N 97.4W
- Storm Intensity 50 mph
- Movement West-northwest or 285 degrees at 21 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Harold is currently making landfall on Padre Island, with maximum winds
of up to 50 mph near the center. In the Matagorda Bay area, farther from
the landfall point, some winds to tropical storm strength are possible
for the next several hours and the tropical storm watch remains in place.
The highest potential for tropical storm winds will continue to be over
the nearshore Gulf waters, where a tropical storm warning continues.
In addition to these gusty winds, strong rip currents are occurring on
Gulf-facing beaches across the Southeast Texas Gulf coast, and some minor
flooding in particularly vulnerable spots around Matagorda Bay is also
possible. Finally, brief waterspouts and/or tornadoes are also possible
in stronger storms that push onshore on the outer edge of the storm.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* TORNADOES:
Potential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across coastal
Southeast Texas. Remain well braced against a tornado event
having possible limited impacts. If realized,
these impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
Elsewhere across Southeast Texas, little to no impact is anticipated.
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across
the Matagorda Bay area. Remain well away from locally hazardous
surge having possible limited impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread
with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where
surge water covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
Elsewhere across Southeast Texas, little to no impact is anticipated.
* WIND:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time
across Southeast Texas.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
If a tornado warning is issued for your area, quickly move to the
safest place within your shelter. Protect your head and body.

Service in Houston/Galveston TX around 4 PM CDT, or sooner if
conditions warrant.</description>
