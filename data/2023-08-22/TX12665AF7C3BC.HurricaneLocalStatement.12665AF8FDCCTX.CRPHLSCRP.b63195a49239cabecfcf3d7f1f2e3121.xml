SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Harold continues to move closer to the southern
Texas coast this morning, with a main rain bands of the system about
to move into the Coastal Bend. This system is is moving to the west-
nothwest at around 18 mph, and is expected to reach land by later this
morning. Observations from offshore marine bouys are indicating
sustained winds around 35-40 mph, with gusts to 60 mph. Locally heavy
rainfall, strong winds, isolated tornadoes and waterspouts and
hazardous coastal and marine conditions remain the primary concerns
with this system. The threats include:
- Flash Flooding: Moderate threat of flash flooding mainly south and
west of I-37, especially in urban areas. Rainfall accumulations 3 to
5&quot; with locally up to 7&quot; through early Wednesday.
- Hazardous Seas: Wave heights 13 to 15 feet with occasionally up to
17 feet.
- Tornadoes: Isolated tornadoes and waterspouts are possible across
South Texas, especially in outer rain bands.
- Coastal Flooding: Moderate coastal flooding is expected with up to
3 ft of inundation possible across the Middle Texas Coast south of
Matagorda Bay.
- Rip Currents: High risk of rip currents across all of the Texas
Coast.
- Strong Winds: Tropical Storm force winds of sustained 40-50 mph with
gusts up to 60-70 mph are possible in the warned areas.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant
impacts across southern Brush Country and southern Coastal Bend.
Potential impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals, and
ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
Prepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across northern portions of the Brush Country and the
rest of the Coastal Plains.
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
South Texas. Potential impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* SURGE:
Prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited impacts
across the Middle Texas coast. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread
with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where
surge water covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
South Texas. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local officials for recommended
preparedness actions, including possible evacuation. If ordered to
evacuate, do so immediately.
If evacuating, leave with a destination in mind and allow extra time
to get there. Take your emergency supplies kit. Gas up your vehicle
ahead of time.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to stay inside and away from windows. Listen for
updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Keep a
battery-powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.
During the peak of the storm be ready to move quickly. Keep your
shoes on and rain gear handy. Boots and athletic shoes offer the best
foot protection if you become unexpectedly exposed to the weather.
Keep your cell phone charged and in power-saving mode. If you lose
power, use it sparingly and mainly for personal emergencies and
check-ins.
Do not be a thrill seeker or risk your life for senseless photos or
videos.
If you are prone to flooding or in an area under a storm surge watch
or warning, be prepared for the possibility of a quick and dramatic
rise in water levels.
If a tornado warning is issued for your area, quickly move to the
safest place within your shelter. Protect your head and body.
