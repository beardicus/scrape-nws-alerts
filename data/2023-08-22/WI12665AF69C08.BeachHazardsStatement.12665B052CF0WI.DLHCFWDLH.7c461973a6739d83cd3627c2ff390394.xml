<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued August 22 at 2:54AM CDT until August 22 at 10:00PM CDT by NWS Duluth</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM CDT THIS MORNING
THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Dangerous swimming conditions are expected along the
Lake Superior shoreline due to high wave action and strong rip
currents.
* WHERE...Minnesota Park Point and Wisconsin Point Beaches.
* WHEN...From 10 AM CDT this morning through this evening.
* IMPACTS...High wave action can make swimming difficult on days
such as this. Incoming waves in rapid succession can tire even
an experienced swimmer quickly. Rip currents can usher you away
from land. To avoid being swept away, swim parallel to the shore
to exit a rip current.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Wave heights will increase rapidly this
afternoon as northeast winds strengthen.</description>
<instruction>Remain out of the water to avoid hazardous swimming conditions.</instruction>
