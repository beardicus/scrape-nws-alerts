corridor of lower dew points will move north into the area with SW
winds occurring. This along with temperatures in the upper 90s to
low 100s will cause RH values to fall into the low to mid teens.
Winds will also be breezy to gusty from sunrise through sunset,
the relative more favorable time for the strongest wind gusts will
be during the mid to late morning hours where gusts around 45 mph
may occur.
