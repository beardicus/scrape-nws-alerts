<headline>Air Quality Alert issued June 23 at 2:37PM CDT  by NWS Duluth</headline>
<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT THROUGH 3 PM CDT SATURDAY...
* WHAT...The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has issued an Air
Quality Alert for fine particle pollution. The Air Quality Index
(AQI) is expected to reach the Orange or Unhealthy for Sensitive
Groups category.
* WHERE...North central Minnesota.
* WHEN...Through 3 PM CDT Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease
(including asthma), heart disease, children, and older adults, may
experience health effects.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Smoke from fires in Ontario will move into
northeast Minnesota today. Smoke will settle over the area Friday
night into Saturday morning. Precipitation is expected Saturday and
that may limit the extent of smoke. There is still considerable
uncertainty as to how far west the smoke will move and how much
precipitation will remove smoke across the area. Smoke is most likely
to impact the area late Friday night into early Saturday morning.

<instruction>Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including
asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults, should limit
prolonged or heavy exertion. Reduce or eliminate activities that
contribute to air pollution, such as outdoor burning, and use of
residential wood burning devices. Reduce vehicle trips and vehicle
idling as much as possible. Keep windows closed overnight to prevent
smoke from getting indoors.</instruction>
