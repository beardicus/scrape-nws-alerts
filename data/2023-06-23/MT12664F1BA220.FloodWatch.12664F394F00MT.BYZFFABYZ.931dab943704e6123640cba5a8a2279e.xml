<headline>Flood Watch issued June 23 at 11:52AM MDT  by NWS Billings</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE SATURDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of southeast Montana, including the following
counties, Carter, Custer, Fallon and Powder River.
* WHEN...Through late Saturday night.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. Storm drains and ditches may
become clogged with debris.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Soils are saturated in many locations after earlier heavy
rainfall events. Rainfall totals over the next 36 hours could
be in excess of 2 inches in many locations. This will lead to
flooding and flash flooding where the heaviest rain falls.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
