<description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in
Nebraska...
Platte River near Darr affecting Dawson County.
...FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is occurring and additional minor flooding
is forecast.
* WHERE...Platte River near Darr, and perhaps other locations along
the river from the Dawson-Lincoln County line downstream to near
Lexington.
* WHEN...Until further notice.
* IMPACTS...At 10.0 feet, Flooding of the low lying land right along
the river can be expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 8:00 AM CDT Friday the stage was 10.2 feet.
- Recent Activity...The maximum river stage in the 24 hours
ending at 8:00 AM CDT Friday was 10.3 feet.
- Forecast...The river gauge near Darr is expected to continue
to remain slightly above minor flood stage for several more
days to come. The stage at the gauge site is currently
expected to crest around 10.7 feet Monday into Tuesday, and
then begin a very gradual fall. Please note that confidence
in this forecast decreases farther out in time, especially
beyond the next 2 to 3 days, as factors such as additional
rainfall near and upstream of the Dawson County area could
alter later forecasts at least slightly.
- Flood stage is 10.0 feet.
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
10.7 feet on 07/09/2019.
