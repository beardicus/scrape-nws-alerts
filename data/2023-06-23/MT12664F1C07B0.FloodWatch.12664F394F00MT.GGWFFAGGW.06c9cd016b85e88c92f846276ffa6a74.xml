<headline>Flood Watch issued June 23 at 2:12PM MDT  by NWS Glasgow</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE SATURDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of northeast Montana, including the following
county, Petroleum.
* WHEN...Through late Saturday night.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Low-water
crossings may be flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- An organized and efficient low pressure system from the
central Rocky Mountains will emerge over the high plains of
eastern Montana this afternoon and slowly move through this
region through Saturday night. Multiple thunderstorms moving
over the same areas will easily cause area creeks and streams
to rise. Ponding and low-land flooding will be possible
through this weekend. Greater rainfall amounts of 1 to 2
inches are more likely near and south of MT-Highway 200.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
