<description>The National Weather Service in Billings has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
The BobCat Burn Area in...
Central Musselshell County in central Montana...
* Until midnight MDT tonight.
* At 604 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing
heavy rain over the BobCat Burn Area. Between 0.5 and 1.5 inches
of rain have fallen. Additional rainfall amounts up to 1 inch are
possible in the warned area. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected
to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through the Halfbreed Creek, East Parrot Creek, Parrot Creek,
West Parrot Creek, Cow Gulch, Railroad Creek, Fattig Creek, and
Rehder Coulee. This water and debris will flow down to the
Musselshell river.
Roads impacted include Highway 87, Beard Road, West Parrot Creek
Road, East Parrot Creek Road, Fattig Creek Road, and Rehder Road.
The debris flow can consist of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose
materials.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms in and around
the BobCat Burn Area.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flooding of areas in and downstream of the BobCat Burn
Area.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Klein.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Life threatening flooding of creeks, roads, and normally dry coulees
in and downstream of the BobCat Burn Area burn area is likely. In
addition to the flash flooding, the heavy rains may trigger
rockslides, mudslides, and debris flows in steep terrain.
Remain alert for flooding of creeks, streams, and normally dry
coulees even in areas not receiving rainfall downstream of the burn
area. These can become raging killer currents in a matter of minutes
even from distant rainfall upstream.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency officials and
request they pass the information to the National Weather Service in
Billings.</instruction>
