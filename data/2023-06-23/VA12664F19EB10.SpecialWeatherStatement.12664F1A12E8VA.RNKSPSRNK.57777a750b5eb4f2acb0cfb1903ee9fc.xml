tracking northward from Caswell county NC into the southern

<instruction>The Danville area has received 2-4 inches of rain over the past 2-3
days. Additional rainfall on saturated ground, even though only
light to moderate, may cause minor flooding in poor drainage and low
lying flood prone areas.
Locally heavy rain will quickly reduce visibility and result in
ponding of water on roadways, standing water in low lying areas, and
minor flooding of creeks, streams, and areas of poor drainage.
Drivers are urged to slow down and use extra caution to avoid
hydroplaning.</instruction>
