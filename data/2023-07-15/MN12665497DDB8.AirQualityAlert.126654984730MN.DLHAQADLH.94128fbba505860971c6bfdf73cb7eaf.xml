<headline>Air Quality Alert issued July 15 at 3:30PM CDT  by NWS Duluth</headline>
<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH 6 PM CDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has extended an Air
Quality Alert for fine particle pollution. The Air Quality Index
(AQI) is expected to reach the Orange or Unhealthy for Sensitive
Groups category.
* WHERE...Portions of central Minnesota.
* WHEN...Through 6 PM CDT today.
* IMPACTS...Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease
(including asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults,
may experience health effects.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Smoke from wildfires in Alberta and British
Columbia will continue to south slowly today. The smoke is
clearing slower than originally anticipated so the air quality
alert has been extended for several hours where air quality
conditions indicate smoke is still lingering.

prolonged or heavy exertion.
Reduce or eliminate activities that contribute to air pollution, such
as outdoor burning, and use of residential wood burning devices.
Reduce vehicle trips and vehicle idling as much as possible.</instruction>
