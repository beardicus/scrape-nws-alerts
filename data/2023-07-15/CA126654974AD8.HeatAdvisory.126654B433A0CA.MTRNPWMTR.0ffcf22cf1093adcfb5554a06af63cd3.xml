* WHAT...Temperatures up to 100 expected.
* WHERE...Northern Salinas Valley, Hollister Valley, and Carmel

* WHEN...Until 11 PM PDT Sunday.

potential for heat related illnesses, particularly for those
working or participating in outdoor activities.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The combination of warm nights and hot
days will be most prevalent Saturday into Monday morning. In
addition to the heat, individuals should be mindful of the
elevated fire danger over the weekend, especially inland and

<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
