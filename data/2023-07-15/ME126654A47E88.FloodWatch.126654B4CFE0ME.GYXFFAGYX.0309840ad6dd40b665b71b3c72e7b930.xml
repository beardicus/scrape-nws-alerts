<headline>Flood Watch issued July 15 at 11:06PM EDT  by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>.Multiple rounds of torrential showers are anticipated Sunday
through Sunday night. There is increasing confidence that locally
considerable impacts are possible for areas with repeating
activity.  Highest threat areas are those that have been recently
affected by heavy rain as well as highly sloped, fast-responding
small streams in the mountains.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM EDT SUNDAY THROUGH LATE
SUNDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Flash floods caused by multiple rounds of torrential
downpours.
* WHERE...Portions of Maine, including the following areas,
Androscoggin, Central Interior Cumberland, Central Somerset,
Coastal Cumberland, Coastal Waldo, Coastal York, Interior
Cumberland Highlands, Interior Waldo, Interior York, Kennebec,
Knox, Lincoln, Northern Franklin, Northern Oxford, Sagadahoc,
Southern Franklin, Southern Oxford and Southern Somerset. Portions
of New Hampshire, including the following areas, Belknap,
Cheshire, Coastal Rockingham, Eastern Hillsborough, Interior
Rockingham, Merrimack, Northern Carroll, Northern Coos, Northern
Grafton, Southern Carroll, Southern Coos, Southern Grafton,
Strafford, Sullivan and Western And Central Hillsborough.
* WHEN...From 6 AM EDT Sunday through late Sunday night.
* IMPACTS...Flash flooding can involve major disruptions to travel,
damages to property, and displacement of people. The risk is high
for campers near fast responding streams which could become
dangerous rivers with flood waters spreading well away from the
banks. Inundation of roads are likely with additional washouts and
some long term closures possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Multiple rounds of torrential rainfall are expected.
Saturated soils from recent rainfall will support rapid
runoff and lead to flash flooding. Considerable impacts are
possible where storms repeat.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor the latest forecast and be prepared to take
action should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.
If you are in a flood prone area, prepare for rapid onset flooding,
with minimum time to react. Never camp on low ground next to streams
since a flash flood can catch you while you`re asleep.</instruction>
