<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT TONIGHT TO MIDNIGHT EDT
SUNDAY NIGHT...
The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy has
issued an Air Quality Alert, in effect from midnight tonight to
midnight EDT Sunday night.
Smoke originating from wildfires in west and central Canada will be
moving in from the northwest today into Sunday. As this happens,
increases in PM2.5 concentrations are expected across the Upper
Peninsula today, then Sunday across the rest of the state as the
plume sinks south. Today the air quality index across the Upper
Peninsula will likely increase into the Unhealthy for Sensitive
Groups (Orange) range; however concentrations reaching the Unhealthy
(Red) level are possible. Concentrations in those ranges move south
into the rest of the state Sunday.
Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including
asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults, should limit
prolonged or heavy exertion.
Reduce or eliminate activities that contribute to air pollution,
such as outdoor burning, and use of residential wood burning devices.
Reduce vehicle trips and vehicle idling as much as possible and
reduce refueling your vehicle.
Keep windows closed overnight to prevent smoke from getting indoors
and, if possible, run central air conditioning with MERV-13 or higher
rated filters.

Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy`s Air Quality Index page on the
