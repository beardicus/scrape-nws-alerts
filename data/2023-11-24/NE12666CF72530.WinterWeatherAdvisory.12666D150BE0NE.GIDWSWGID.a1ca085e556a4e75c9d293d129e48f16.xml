<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued November 24 at 4:04AM CST until November 26 at 12:00AM CST by NWS Hastings</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO MIDNIGHT CST
SATURDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 1 and 3
inches.
* WHERE...Buffalo County.
* WHEN...From noon today to midnight CST Saturday Night.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the Friday evening commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...It will not snow throughout the entire
duration of this Advisory, with snow instead falling
intermittently. There is also some uncertainty in snow amounts, as
dry air could potentially delay the onset of snow and reduce
amounts, especially this afternoon and evening. No matter how much
it snows, confidence is high that blowing and drifting snow will
not be a significant issue, with winds only averaging 5 to 15 MPH,
from the east most of the time but shifting to westerly Saturday
afternoon.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling. The latest road
conditions for the state you are calling from can be obtained by
