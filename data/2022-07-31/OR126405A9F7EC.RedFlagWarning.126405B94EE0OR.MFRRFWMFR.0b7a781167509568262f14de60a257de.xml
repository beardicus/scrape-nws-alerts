<description>...Abundant Lightning On Dry Fuels Expected through Monday...
.Heat, instability, and increasing moisture along with multiple
low pressure impulses moving through this afternoon through Monday
evening are expected to bring isolated to scattered thunderstorms
and abundant lightning on dry fuels to the area. Through this
evening, abundant lightning is likely from the Marble Mountains
and Siskiyous northeastward and Cascades eastward. Monday
afternoon and evening the lightning threat will be greatest from
the Cascades eastward.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON TO 11 PM PDT
MONDAY FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONES
285 AND 625...
* Impacts:  Isolated thunderstorms are expected today. Tomorrow
abundant lightning on critically dry vegetation will likely
result in numerous new fire starts today. Gusty thunderstorm
outflow wind gusts of 30 to as high as 60 mph could contribute to
fire spread. Despite locally heavy downpours that could be
wetting, initial attack resources could be overwhelmed and
holdover fires are possible.
* Affected area:
In Northern CA Fire Zone....285 including Tionesta, Canby, Alturas,
Likely, and Willow Ranch.
In South Central OR Fire Zone....625 including Adel, Fort Rock, Summer
Lake, and Paisly, plus Alkali Lake.
* Thunderstorms: While isolated thunderstorms will be possible
Sunday, the possibility of abundant lightning is currently
greatest on Monday for this area.
* Rainfall: Monday, scattered thunderstorms will be a mix of wet
and dry. Locally significant wetting rainfall will be possible
with some of the thunderstorms, especially the slower moving ones.
