Cascades, Methow and Okanogan Valley, Waterville Plateau, and

across the eastern districts of Washington by Tuesday with
critical fire weather conditions likely across the Spokane Area,
Palouse, and foothills of the Northeast Blue Mountains along with
in central Washington in the lee of the Cascade Mountains.
