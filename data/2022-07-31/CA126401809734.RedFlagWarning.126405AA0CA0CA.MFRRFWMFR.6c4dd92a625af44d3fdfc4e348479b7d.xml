<headline>Red Flag Warning issued July 31 at 4:41PM PDT until July 31 at 11:00PM PDT by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...Abundant Lightning On Dry Fuels Expected through Monday...
.Heat, instability, and increasing moisture along with multiple
low pressure impulses moving through this afternoon through Monday
evening are expected to bring isolated to scattered thunderstorms
and abundant lightning on dry fuels to the area. Through this
evening, abundant lightning is likely from the Marble Mountains
and Siskiyous northeastward and Cascades eastward. Monday afternoon
and evening the lightning threat will be greatest from the Cascades
eastward.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM PDT THIS EVENING
FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONES 280 AND
281...
The National Weather Service in Medford has cancelled the Fire
Weather Watch.
* Impacts: Abundant lightning on critically dry vegetation will
likely result in numerous new fire starts today. Gusty
thunderstorm outflow wind gusts of 30 to as high as 60 mph could
contribute to fire spread. Despite locally heavy downpours that
could be wetting, initial attack resources could be overwhelmed
and holdover fires are possible.
* Affected area:
In Northern CA...Fire Weather Zones 280 and 281.
* Rainfall: Today, thunderstorms are expected to be a mix of wet
and dry, so locally significant wetting rainfall will be
possible with some of the thunderstorms, especially the slower
moving ones.
