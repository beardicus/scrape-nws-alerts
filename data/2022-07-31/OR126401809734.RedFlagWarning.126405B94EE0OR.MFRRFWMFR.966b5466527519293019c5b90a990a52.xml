<headline>Red Flag Warning issued July 31 at 4:41PM PDT until August 01 at 11:00PM PDT by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...Abundant Lightning On Dry Fuels Expected through Monday...
.Heat, instability, and increasing moisture along with multiple
low pressure impulses moving through this afternoon through Monday
evening are expected to bring isolated to scattered thunderstorms
and abundant lightning on dry fuels to the area. Through this
evening, abundant lightning is likely from the Marble Mountains
and Siskiyous northeastward and Cascades eastward. Monday afternoon
and evening the lightning threat will be greatest from the Cascades
eastward.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM PDT THIS EVENING
FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONES 284,
617, 623, AND 624...
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM NOON TO 11 PM PDT MONDAY FOR
ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONES 284, 617,
623, AND 624...
The National Weather Service in Medford has issued a Red Flag
Warning...which is in effect from noon to 11 PM PDT Monday. The
Fire Weather Watch is no longer in effect.
* Impacts: Abundant lightning on critically dry vegetation will
likely result in numerous new fire starts today and Monday.
Gusty thunderstorm outflow wind gusts of 30 to as high as 60 mph
could contribute to fire spread. Despite locally heavy downpours
that could be wetting, initial attack resources could be
overwhelmed and holdover fires are possible.
* Affected area:
- In Northern CA Fire Zone....284.
- In South Central OR Fire Zone....624.
- In Southwest OR Fire Zones...617...623.
* Rainfall: Today and Monday, thunderstorms are expected to be a
mix of wet and dry, so locally significant wetting rainfall will
be possible with some of the thunderstorms, especially the slower
moving ones.
