<description>The National Weather Service in Albuquerque has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
The Hermit`s Peak/Calf Canyon burn scar in...
Southwestern Mora County in northeastern New Mexico...
Northwestern San Miguel County in northeastern New Mexico...
* Until 1130 PM MDT.
* At 934 PM MDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated
thunderstorms producing heavy rain over the Hermit`s Peak/Calf
Canyon Burn Scar. Between 0.25 and 0.5 inches of rain have fallen.
The expected rainfall rate is 0.25 to 0.75 inches in 1 hour. Flash
flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will impact drainages in and
around Gascon, Rociada, Mora, and potentially further south in the
Gallinas and Tecolote drainage basins. The debris flow can consist
of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms in and around
the Hermit`s Peak/Calf Canyon Burn Scar.
SOURCE...Radar and automated gauges.
IMPACT...Flooding of areas in and around the Hermit`s Peak/Calf
Canyon Burn Scar.

<instruction>Runoff from rainfall will cause elevated water levels within
vulnerable drainages in and downstream of the Hermit`s Peak/Calf
Canyon fire burn area.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Do not camp along streams and rivers. Remain alert when hiking in
steep, narrow canyons. Know where you are relative to low spots and
drainages.</instruction>
