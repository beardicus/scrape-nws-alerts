AIR QUALITY ADVISORY
VALID TIME: Wednesday June 30, 2022 2:00 PM to Tuesday July 05,
2022 2:00 PM, advisory will be issued until end of the event.
TIME/DATE OF THE NEXT REPORT: Tuesday July 05, 2022 2:00 PM, if
needed.
ADVISORY: Red Flag Warning (hot, dry, windy conditions) has been
issued for Kuskokwim Valley through 1 am Saturday. These
conditions will allow for continued growth of the Lime Complex
fires. Winds thru the weekend will carry surface and upper level
smoke to the northwest. Sunday, the wind forecast appears to show
a wind shift, out of the southwest, over the Lime Complex fires.
This shift will again push smoke up against the blocking Alaska
Range and move smoke north and south towards Kodiak. The Air
Quality will vary between GOOD and UNHEALTHY depending on wind
flow and proximity to the fires.
Be aware that areas immediately downwind of any fire will
experience HAZARDOUS levels of smoke. Generally, worse conditions
occur overnight and during the early morning hours, as the
atmosphere cools and brings smoke to the surface. During the day,
surface heating will mix smoke and carry it upwards, temporarily
improving air quality.
SMOKE AND PUBLIC IMPACT: This is an area forecast, and as such is
a general forecast for portions of Southwestern Interior Alaska.
Smoke intensity will vary depending on precise location and local
wind flow patterns. Smoke concentrations will be such that they
could impact public health at times. It is advised that travelers
check local weather as smoke conditions may vary considerably from
one locality to the next. The most recent weather observations
for the surrounding impacted areas may be found on the Federal
Aviation Administration Weather Cams homepage at
https://weathercams.faa.gov/.
In smoke impacted areas, DEC advises people with respiratory or
heart disease, the elderly and children should avoid prolonged
exertion; everyone else should limit prolonged exertion.

Mark Smith with the Division of Air Quality at 907-269-7676.</description>
