<headline>Flood Warning issued July 01 at 3:21AM AKDT  by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING FOR A GLACIER-DAMMED LAKE OUTBURST REMAINS IN
EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM AKDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by a glacier-dammed lake outburst continues.
* WHERE...The following area, Central Inner Channels.
* WHEN...Until 1000 PM AKDT Friday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, other low-lying
areas and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 317 AM AKDT, river gauge reports indicate rises in water
levels from a glacier-dammed lake outburst across the warned
area. Flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly,
especially near the Taku River.
- The rate of rise on the Taku River has slowed down, and we
will continue to monitor the river through the early morning.
- For Taku River near Juneau:
At 2:00am the stage was 43.23 feet.
Flood Stage is 43.0 feet.
Forecast: A crest around 44.4 feet is expected around 4:00am
Friday.
Impacts:
At 43.3 feet: The water level will be at the top of the hill
in front of the house near the gauge.
- Inherent uncertainty in initial glacier lake volume will
result in varying crest height and timing.
- If you live near or along Taku River stay alert and be prepared
to take action.
- The cold water temperatures can increase the threat of
hypothermia and lower the time required to cause hypothermia.</description>
