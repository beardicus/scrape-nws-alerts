<description>...ANOTHER HEAT WAVE LIKELY THIS LATE WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT
WEEK...
Widespread hot temperatures are expected to develop again late this
weekend with highs in the upper 70s into the 80s for the inner
channels. Locations away from the water will be the warmest.
Starting Sunday and continuing through the first half of the week,
some locations of the Inner Channels could reach the upper 80s.
Daily high temperature records will likely fall in some areas.
To minimize impacts of the heat wave, locate fans for cooling;
wear light-colored and loose fitting clothes; drink plenty of
fluids, apply sun protection, and take breaks if you must be
outdoors for extended periods; do not leave young children and
pets unattended in closed vehicles; and plan to check on the
elderly, those who are home-bound, and other loved ones and
neighbors who could be more vulnerable.
The very warm temperatures will also continue to produce snow and
ice melt to keep larger rivers systems at high levels.
For Taiya River near Skagway:
At 5:00am the stage was 15.69 feet.
Flood Stage is 16.5 feet.
Forecast: A crest around 16.2 feet is expected around 10:00pm
Saturday.
Impacts:
At 16.1 feet: Portions of the Chilkoot Trail begins to inundate with
water.</description>
