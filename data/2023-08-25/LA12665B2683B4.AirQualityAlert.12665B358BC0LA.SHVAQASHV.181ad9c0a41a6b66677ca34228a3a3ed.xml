<description>...AIR QUALITY ACTION DAY IN EFFECT...
The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality is forecasting
an Air Quality Action Day for Caddo Parishes. An Air Quality
Action Day indicates that increasing ozone or fine particulates
(PM 2.5) levels may cause unhealthy air quality conditions during
the afternoon hours. Active children and adults, the elderly and
people with respiratory diseases such as asthma, should avoid
prolonged outdoor exertion. Please take whatever voluntary steps
you can to reduce emissions that contribute to reduced air
quality. Drive less and make sure your automobile is in good
working condition. Make sure your gas cap is tight and wait until
after 6 PM to refuel your vehicle. Additionally, limit the use of
gas powered lawn equipment.
More information about current air quality conditions and what
you can do to help prevent ozone formation or degraded air
quality is available at the Department of Environmental Quality
website www.deq.louisiana.gov.
