<headline>Special Weather Statement issued August 25 at 7:35PM ChST  by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>A developing tropical system, known as Invest 93W from the Joint
Typhoon Warning Center has formed roughly 160 miles west-southwest
of Guam.
Expectations: 93W has the potential to eventually develop into a
tropical system, with a general consensus of the model forecasts
tracking it towards the Marianas. There`s still some question as
to the exact track and does the system develop into something
stronger? It`s to early to pin down details as the system is still
3 to 5 days out. What is of higher confidence is fairly gusty
winds, hazardous to perhaps dangerous sea and surf conditions, and
locally heavy rainfall are distinct possibilities to develop.
Although it`s a bit too early to say for sure, these are &quot;worst case&quot;
forecasts. However, there`s still some variability in the model
guidance and these values may change in the coming days. Please
continue to monitor the forecast for updates!
Rainfall: Rainfall of 4 to 8 inches may develop in the Monday
through Thursday time frame, with locally higher
amounts possible.
Winds/Surf: Land - 25 to 30 mph with gusts to 45 mph possible,
especially near heavier showers or thunderstorms
that develop.
Hazardous surf of 10 to perhaps 16 feet feet for
south and west facing reefs.
Winds/Seas: Marine - sustained winds of 25 to 35 knots with
gusts to 45 knots, especially near heavier showers
or thunderstorms. Seas building into the 14 to 18
foot range.</description>
