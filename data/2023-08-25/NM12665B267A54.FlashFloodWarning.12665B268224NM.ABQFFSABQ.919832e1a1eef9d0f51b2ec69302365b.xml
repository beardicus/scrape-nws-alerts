0.5 to 1.25 inches are possible in the warned area. Flash flooding
is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will impact the Tecolote Creek
and Gallinas River drainage areas. The debris flow can consist of
rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms producing
flash flooding in and around the Hermits Peak and Calf
Canyon Burn Scar.
SOURCE...Radar.

the Hermits Peak and Calf Canyon Burn Scar.

FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>Runoff from rainfall will cause elevated water levels within
vulnerable drainages in and downstream of the Hermits Peak Calf
Canyon fire burn area.
In hilly or mountainous terrain there are numerous of low water
crossings which are potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not
attempt to cross flooded roads. Find an alternate route.
Do not camp along streams and rivers. Remain alert when hiking in
steep, narrow canyons. Know where you are relative to low spots and
drainages.
This is a life threatening situation. Heavy rainfall will cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks, streams and ditches
in the Hermits Peak and Calf Canyon Burn Scar. Severe debris flows
can also be anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may be
washed away in places. If you encounter flood waters, climb to
safety.</instruction>
