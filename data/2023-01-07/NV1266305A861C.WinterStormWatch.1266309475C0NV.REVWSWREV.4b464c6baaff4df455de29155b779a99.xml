<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 07 at 12:31PM PST until January 10 at 4:00PM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>A series of systems will impact the region through the middle part
of next week. Through Sunday, snowfall will impact the Sierra and
northeast California, in addition to portions of western Nevada.
A more potent atmospheric river will bring significant moisture to
the region Monday and Tuesday. Snow levels are expected to rise
Monday afternoon and evening, bringing the chance for heavy rain
and flooding impacts to the lower elevations. Regardless, major
snowfall accumulations are likely for the Sierra with chances
increasing for major snow impacts in western Nevada, particularly
above 5,000 feet.
...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH
TUESDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Heavy wet snow possible. The highest snow amounts will
favor west of US-95. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 4 inches
possible, except 4 to 18 inches above 6,000 feet. Winds could
gust as high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...Mineral and Southern Lyon Counties.
* WHEN...From late Sunday night through Tuesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute. Gusty winds could bring down tree branches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow levels will start at 3,500-4,000 feet
early Monday. They will rise to 6,500-7,500 feet for a time on
Monday afternoon and evening before falling back to 4,500-5,500
feet through Tuesday. Because of the uncertainty and variation
of snow levels and precipitation intensity, urban and small
stream flooding is possible in the lower valleys, especially
where there is poor drainage from current debris and snowpack.
The severity of flooding will be highly dependent on the
variation of snow levels and precipitation rate during this
time.</description>
<instruction>Now is the time to prepare an emergency kit for your home and
car. If traveling consider alternate plans, remember to carry
tire chains, extra food, water and clothing. Once the storm
arrives, travel may be difficult or impossible for an extended
period of time.</instruction>
