<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 07 at 12:31PM PST until January 11 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>A series of systems will impact the region through the middle part
of next week. Through Sunday, snowfall will impact the Sierra and
northeast California, in addition to portions of western Nevada.
A more potent atmospheric river will bring significant moisture to
the region Monday and Tuesday. Snow levels are expected to rise
Monday afternoon and evening, bringing the chance for heavy rain
and flooding impacts to the lower elevations. Regardless, major
snowfall accumulations are likely for the Sierra with chances
increasing for major snow impacts in western Nevada, particularly
above 5,000 feet.
...WINTER STORM WARNING NOW IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM THIS EVENING TO
4 AM PST WEDNESDAY...
...WINTER STORM WATCH IS REPLACED WITH ONE LONGER WINTER STORM
WARNING...
* CHANGES... Replaced the Winter Storm Watch with a Winter Storm
Warning and removed elevation distinction.
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Through Sunday night, total snow
accumulations of 2 to 7 inches, except 7 to 18 inches west of
Highway 395. From Monday through Tuesday night, total snow
accumulations up to 12 inches, except 12 to 30 inches west of
Highway 395. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Lassen-Eastern Plumas-Eastern Sierra Counties.
* WHEN...From 7 PM this evening to 4 AM PST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...With the atmospheric river on Monday, snow
levels will likely rise to 5,500-7,000 feet for a period of time
Monday afternoon and evening before falling once again. Urban
and small stream flooding is possible in the lower elevations.
The severity of flooding will be dependent on the variation of
snow levels and precipitation rate during this time.</description>
