<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 07 at 12:31PM PST until January 10 at 4:00PM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>A series of systems will impact the region through the middle part
of next week. Through Sunday, snowfall will impact the Sierra and
northeast California, in addition to portions of western Nevada.
A more potent atmospheric river will bring significant moisture to
the region Monday and Tuesday. Snow levels are expected to rise
Monday afternoon and evening, bringing the chance for heavy rain
and flooding impacts to the lower elevations. Regardless, major
snowfall accumulations are likely for the Sierra with chances
increasing for major snow impacts in western Nevada, particularly
above 5,000 feet.
...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH
TUESDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Heavy wet snow possible. Total snow accumulations of up
to 3 inches in the valleys, except 3 to 7 inches above 5000
feet. Above 6,000 feet, including cities like Virginia City,
isolated totals up to 2 feet are possible. Wind gusts up to 40
mph possible.
* WHERE...Greater Reno-Carson City-Minden Area.
* WHEN...From late Sunday night through Tuesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow levels will start at all valley floors
early Monday. They are expected to rise to 5,500-6,500 feet for
a time on Monday afternoon and evening before falling back to
4,000-5,000 feet through Tuesday. However, there remains a
chance that snow will be the primary precipitation type for a longer
part of the day on Monday. Because of this uncertainty and
variation of snow levels, urban and small stream flooding will
remain possible in the lower valleys, especially where there is
poor drainage from current debris and snowpack. The severity of
flooding will be highly dependent on the variation of snow
levels and precipitation rate during this time.</description>
<instruction>Now is the time to prepare an emergency kit for your home and
car. If traveling consider alternate plans, remember to carry
tire chains, extra food, water and clothing. Once the storm
arrives, travel may be difficult or impossible for an extended
period of time.</instruction>
