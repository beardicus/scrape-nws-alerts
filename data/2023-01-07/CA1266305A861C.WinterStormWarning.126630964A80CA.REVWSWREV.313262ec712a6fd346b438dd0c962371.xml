<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 07 at 12:31PM PST until January 11 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>A series of systems will impact the region through the middle part
of next week. Through Sunday, snowfall will impact the Sierra and
northeast California, in addition to portions of western Nevada.
A more potent atmospheric river will bring significant moisture to
the region Monday and Tuesday. Snow levels are expected to rise
Monday afternoon and evening, bringing the chance for heavy rain
and flooding impacts to the lower elevations. Regardless, major
snowfall accumulations are likely for the Sierra with chances
increasing for major snow impacts in western Nevada, particularly
above 5,000 feet.
...WINTER STORM WARNING NOW IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM THIS EVENING TO
4 AM PST WEDNESDAY...
...WINTER STORM WATCH IS REPLACED WITH ONE LONGER WINTER STORM
WARNING...
* CHANGES... Replaced the Winter Storm Watch with a Winter Storm
Warning and removed elevation distinction.
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Through Sunday night, total snow
accumulations of 4 to 12 inches, except 8 to 22 inches above
7000 feet. For Monday through Tuesday night, 6 to 15 inches,
except 2 to 4 feet above 7,000 feet. Wind gusts up to 50 mph
with ridges gusting 100-130 mph. Waves up to 4 feet on Lake
Tahoe.
* WHERE...Greater Lake Tahoe Area.
* WHEN...From 7 PM this evening to 4 AM PST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute. Very strong winds could cause extensive tree damage.
Wind and waves may capsize small vessels.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...With the atmospheric river on Monday, snow
levels will likely rise to 7,000-7,500 feet for a period of time
Monday afternoon and evening before falling once again. Urban
and small stream flooding is possible in the lower valleys,
especially where there is poor drainage from current debris and
snowpack. The severity of flooding will be dependent on the
variation of snow levels and precipitation rate during this
time.</description>
