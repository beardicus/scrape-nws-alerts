<headline>High Surf Advisory issued January 07 at 5:03PM ChST until January 10 at 6:00AM ChST by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...HIGH RISK OF RIP CURRENTS UNTIL 6 PM CHST THIS EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM MONDAY TO 6 AM TUESDAY...
...HIGH RISK OF RIP CURRENTS FROM 6 AM MONDAY TO 6 AM TUESDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, hazardous surf of 7 to 10 feet
expected in the surf zone. For the High Rip Current Risk,
dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...North facing reefs of the Marianas.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, from 6 AM Monday to 6 AM
Tuesday. For the High Rip Current Risk, until 6 PM this evening,
then from early Monday morning to early Tuesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...An approaching tropical disturbance will
interact with a descending shearline, bringing swell and wind waves
that will produce hazardous surf along north facing reefs of the
Marianas early Monday morning. Surf will fall below hazardous
criteria upon exit of said features, but may become hazardous once
again towards the second half of the week upon arrival of another
shearline, if conditions warrant.</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
If caught in a rip current, relax and float. Don`t swim against the
current. If able, swim in a direction following the shoreline. If
unable to escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
