<description>...Rain and snow mix to affect northern Nevada Sunday...
Moisture from a series of strong Pacific weather features will
move into northwest Nevada late tonight into Sunday bringing
higher elevation snow and a rain snow mix to valleys across
Humboldt county, moving into northern Elko county later on
Sunday. Higher snow amounts will be concentrated in higher
elevations above 5000 feet mainly west of US-95 where 3 to 5
inches of snow is possible by Sunday evening. Less than an inch
of snow is expected on most valley roadways with up to 2 inches
along mountain passes. Valleys including higher population centers
including Winnemucca will likely see a rain snow mix during the
day Sunday.
Motorists should remain alert to changing weather and road
conditions, and reduce speeds over snow covered roadways. More
rain and snow is expected Monday and Tuesday across northern
Nevada as a strong atmospheric river impacts the region.
