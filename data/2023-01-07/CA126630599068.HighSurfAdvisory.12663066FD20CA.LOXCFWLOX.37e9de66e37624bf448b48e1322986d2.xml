<headline>High Surf Advisory issued January 07 at 6:02AM PST until January 07 at 6:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM PST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Large breaking waves of 6 to 9 feet. Dangerous rip
currents expected.
* WHERE...Ventura County Beaches, especially along southwest and
west facing shores.

abnormally strong, very dangerous rip currents.</description>

near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
