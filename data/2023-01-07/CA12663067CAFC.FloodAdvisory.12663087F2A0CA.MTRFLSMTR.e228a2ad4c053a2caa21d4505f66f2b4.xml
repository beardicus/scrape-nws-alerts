<headline>Flood Advisory issued January 07 at 11:27PM PST until January 10 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>.Light to occasionally moderate rain is falling over Big Sur and the
Santa Lucia Range. While rain rates have been below thresholds for
significant slides, the constant training of storms has prompted the
issuance of a Flood Advisory. This rain may result in ponding on
roadways, especially on Highway 1, as well as in low-lying areas.
Given that soils are already saturated, some land movement is
possible that could knock mud, rocks, or other debris onto roadways.
