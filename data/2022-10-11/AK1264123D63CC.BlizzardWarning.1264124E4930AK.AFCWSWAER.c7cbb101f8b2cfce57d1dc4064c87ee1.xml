<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM WEDNESDAY TO 7 AM AKDT
THURSDAY FOR THOMPSON PASS...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions expected. Visibility reduced to 1/4
mile or less. Total snow accumulations of 8 to 16 inches. Winds
30 to 40 mph gusting as high as 55 mph.
* WHERE...Thompson Pass.
* WHEN...From 1 PM Wednesday to 7 AM AKDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Widespread blowing
snow will significantly reduce visibility. Travel could be
difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A potent storm system will move from the
Gulf of Alaska north to an area near Cordova Wednesday
afternoon. Snow is expected to develop by Wednesday afternoon
and continue through Thursday morning before tapering off.
Northerly gap winds will also develop Wednesday afternoon as the
storm system moves toward the coast. The strongest winds are
expected from late Wednesday afternoon through early morning
Thursday. The winds are then expected to slowly diminish
through the day Thursday.</description>
<instruction>A Blizzard Warning means severe winter weather conditions are
expected or occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds
and poor visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout
conditions, making travel very hazardous. If you must travel,
have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded, stay
with your vehicle.
For the latest road conditions call 5 1 1 or visit
