<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM AKDT
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Coastal erosion and minor coastal flooding expected.
* WHERE...Northern Arctic Coast including Utqiagvik.
* WHEN...From 10 AM Tuesday to 4 AM AKDT Thursday.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Water levels are expected to rise 2 to 3

afternoon.</description>
