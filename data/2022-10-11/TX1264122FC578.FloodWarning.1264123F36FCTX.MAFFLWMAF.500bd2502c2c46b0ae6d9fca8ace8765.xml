<description>...The National Weather Service in Midland/Odessa TX has issued a
Flood Warning for the following rivers in Texas...
Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch affecting Brewster County.
.The Rio Grande has risen to minor flood stage due to runoff from
recent rainfall. The river is expected to crest this afternoon and
fall below flood stage this evening and overnight.
For the Rio Grande...including Presidio 6WNW, Presidio International
Bridge, Presidio 5SE, Castolon, Johnson Ranch, Boquillas, Dryden
16S, Terlingua 8S...Moderate flooding is forecast.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL LATE TOMORROW MORNING...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch.
* WHEN...Until late tomorrow morning.
* IMPACTS...At 12.0 feet (3.7 meters), the river reaches bankfull,
minor lowland flooding occurs, and no significant damage is
expected.
At 15.0 feet (4.6 meters), flood stage is reached.  Moderate
lowland flooding begins.  Roads that lead to Cottonwood Campground
and River Road may flood.  Stages are practically synonymous with
the gage at Cottonwood Campground at Castolon (CSTT2), and
therefore represent the reach from Santa Elena Canyon through
Cottonwood Campground, where damage may occur.  Cattle also graze
in the lowlands, and may be threatened.

this afternoon to a crest of 16.2 feet (4.9 meters) late this
