<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM THIS
MORNING TO 4 AM AKDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Coastal erosion and minor coastal flooding expected.
* WHERE...Northern Arctic Coast including Utqiagvik.
* WHEN...From 10 AM Tuesday to 4 AM AKDT Thursday.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Water levels are expected to rise 2 to 3

afternoon.</description>
