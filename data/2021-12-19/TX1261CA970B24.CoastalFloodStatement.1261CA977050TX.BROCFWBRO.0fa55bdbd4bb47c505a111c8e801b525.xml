<description>...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM CST THIS
EVENING...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
For the Coastal Flood Statement, isolated minor coastal
flooding.
* WHERE...Coastal Kenedy, Coastal Cameron and Coastal Willacy
Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Monday
afternoon. For the Coastal Flood Statement, until 11 PM CST
this evening.
* IMPACTS...Wave run-up may approach the dunes along narrow
beaches. Beach equipment, such as umbrellas and chairs, could
be moved by waves. Vehicles driving along narrow beaches may
experience higher water levels. Elevated water levels may also
occur across the Laguna Madre and South Bay, and along State
Highway 4 west of Boca Chica State Park. Rip currents can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Water levels from SPI Brazos Santiago
continue to run about a foot above astronomical predictions, but
levels should be decreasing as high tide occurred at 7:22 PM
this evening.</description>
<instruction>Do not drive through flooded roadways.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
