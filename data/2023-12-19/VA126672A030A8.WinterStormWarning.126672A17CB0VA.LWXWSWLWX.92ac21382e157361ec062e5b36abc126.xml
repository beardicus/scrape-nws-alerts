<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM EST THIS
MORNING...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 4
to 8 inches along and north of Route 250 and 2 to 4 inches
south of Route 250. West to northwest wind gusts around 30 to
50 mph are expected as well.
* WHERE...Western Highland County.
* WHEN...Until 10 AM EST this morning.
* IMPACTS...The combination of snow and blowing snow will reduce
visibility below one-half mile at times causing near blizzard
conditions, especially along and north of Route 250. The
hazardous conditions will impact the morning commute today with
snow covered and slippery surfaces. Gusty winds could bring
down tree branches and a few power outages may result.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
When venturing outside, watch your first few steps taken on
steps, sidewalks, and driveways, which could be icy and slippery,
increasing your risk of a fall and injury.</instruction>
