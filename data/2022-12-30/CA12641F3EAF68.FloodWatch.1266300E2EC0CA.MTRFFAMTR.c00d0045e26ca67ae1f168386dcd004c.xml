<headline>Flood Watch issued December 30 at 3:14PM PST until January 02 at 12:00PM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>.Light to moderate rain will continue to saturate soils across the
region today, ahead of a strong Pacific storm tonight through
Saturday. Moderate rain will develop this evening across North Bay
before spreading south and east during the early morning hours on
Saturday. Heaviest rain is expect during the cold frontal passage
early Saturday morning into the afternoon. Therefore, increased
runoff will result in rapid rises and flooding of area rivers,
streams, and creeks. High tide in the San Francisco Bay Saturday
morning will coincide with the heaviest rain which could result in
coastal flooding along the Bay shorelines in low-lying/flood prone
areas.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible. Coastal flooding along the San Francisco Bay shorelines
possible during high tide Saturday morning.
* WHERE...A portion of northern California, including the following
areas, Coastal North Bay Including Point Reyes National Seashore,
Marin Coastal Range, North Bay Interior Mountains, North Bay
Interior Valleys, Sonoma Coastal Range, and San Francisco Bay
shoreline.
* WHEN...Through Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations
including bay shorelines during high tide. Creeks and streams may
rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur in poor drainage and
urban areas. Low-water crossings may be flooded. Increased
potential for shallow mudslides.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A number of forecast points on North Bay rivers and streams
are already forecast to rise above monitor stage and
potentially above flood stage.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
