<headline>Flood Advisory issued December 30 at 9:23AM PST until January 01 at 2:00PM PST by NWS Eureka</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 945 PM PST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Urban and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall continues.
* WHERE...A portion of northwest California, including the following
county, Humboldt.
* WHEN...Until 945 PM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding will occur in low lying areas around Humboldt
Bay this afternoon and evening with more widespread ponding water
during periods of heaviest rainfall. Urban areas are susceptible
to street flooding as storm drain capacities are exceeded. Small
streams and creeks will rise and may exceed their channel and
culvert capacities causing localized flooding.  Areas of
particular concern are Jolly Giant, Jacoby, Freshwater, and Salmon
Creeks as well as Elk River and the numerous sloughs around the
bay. High tides coincident with rising stream flow will enhance
flooding in low lying coastal areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 922 AM PST, Trained weather spotters reported heavy rain
in the advisory area. This will cause urban and small stream
flooding.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches are expected
over the area. This additional rain will result in minor
flooding.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Eureka, Arcata, Fortuna, Rio Dell, Carlotta, McKinleyville,
Westhaven-Moonstone, Ferndale, Blue Lake, Pine Hills, Cutten,
Humboldt Hill, Bayview, Myrtletown, Freshwater, Fairhaven,
Fernbridge, Loleta, Samoa and Rohnerville.
