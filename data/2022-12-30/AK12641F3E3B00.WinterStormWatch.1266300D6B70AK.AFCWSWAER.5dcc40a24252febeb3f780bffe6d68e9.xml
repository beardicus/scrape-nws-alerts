<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued December 30 at 11:16AM AKST until January 02 at 6:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY EVENING THROUGH
LATE SUNDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Heavy snow and rain possible. Total snow accumulations of
up to 6 inches except 15 to 20 inches through Turnagain Pass.
Easterly winds could gust as high as 80 mph through Portage
Valley and eastern Turnagain Arm and 15 to 30 mph for the
remainder of the area.
* WHERE...Western Prince William Sound, including the Seward
Highway Corridor from Bird Point to Seward.
* WHEN...From Saturday evening through late Sunday night.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be extremely hazardous. Areas of blowing
snow, mainly through the Turnagain Pass area could
significantly reduce visibility. Strong winds could cause tree
damage.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...There is quite a bit of uncertainty in the
track of this storm, so exact timing and amount of precipitation
could change. Steady light precipitation during the day Saturday
will give way to much heavier precipitation beginning Saturday
evening. Snow levels will start out at 200 to 600 feet above sea
level Saturday then rapidly rise to 1100 to 1700 feet Sunday
morning. Therefore, expect a quick transition from heavy snow to
heavy rain. Areas right at sea level, including Whittier, Seward
and eastern Turnagain Arm will see mostly rain from this storm
with little or no snow accumulation. Winds will steadily
strengthen Saturday through Saturday night then peak during the
day Sunday.</description>
