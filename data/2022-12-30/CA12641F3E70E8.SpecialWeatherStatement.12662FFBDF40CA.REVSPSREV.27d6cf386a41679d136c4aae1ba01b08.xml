<description>...Significant Storm Moving through Western Nevada New Year`s
Weekend with Continued Storms into the New Year...
A significant storm will impact western Nevada through Sunday
morning with gusty winds and moderate-to-heavy rain. The weather
pattern will remain active through the first week of 2023 with
multiple cold storms and a potential for snow accumulations down
to valley floors.
* Winds may be strong at times into Saturday. Localized gusts
could exceed 60 mph and impact travel for high profile vehicles.
* The heaviest rain will move through western Nevada early
Saturday morning into Saturday evening. Be prepared for flood
impacts near creeks, streams, ditches, urban areas, and poorly
drained locations. Be cautious traveling about the region,
especially at night, when flood waters are more difficult to
see.
* Temperatures will become colder near the end of the storm
Saturday night and Sunday morning. A period of snow is possible
Saturday night as low as 5000 feet, with a couple of inches of
slushy accumulations on roads. Temperatures are forecast to fall
to near or below freezing Sunday morning before sunrise, which
could freeze wet roads and form areas of black ice. Additional
road impacts are possible Sunday night into the Monday morning
commute as even colder temperatures are expected.
* Colder storms are looking more favorable for the first week of
2023. A stronger storm January 4th through 5th is possible with
gusty winds, significant snowfall, and impacts to travel.</description>
