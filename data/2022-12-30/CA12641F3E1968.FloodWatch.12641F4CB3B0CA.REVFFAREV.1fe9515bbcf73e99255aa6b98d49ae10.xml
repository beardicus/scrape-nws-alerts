<headline>Flood Watch issued December 30 at 11:30AM PST  by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE SATURDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...River and urban flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of California and Nevada, including the following
areas, in California, Greater Lake Tahoe Area, Lassen-Eastern
Plumas-Eastern Sierra Counties, Mono County and Surprise Valley
California. In Nevada, Greater Lake Tahoe Area, Greater
Reno-Carson City-Minden Area and Northern Washoe County.
* WHEN...Through late Saturday night.
* IMPACTS...Flows are increasing on rivers, creeks, and streams.
Excessive runoff may result in flooding of mainstem rivers,
creeks, streams, urban areas, low water crossings, and locations
with poor drainage.
* Mainstem river flooding is most likely to occur on the East Fork
of the Carson River, and the Susan and Pit Rivers in Lassen
County. Creeks and streams draining large portions of their
watershed under approximately 7,000 feet will also be prone to
flooding. Out-of-bank flows could result in road closures, causing
travel impacts.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- High snow levels along with prolonged heavy rainfall on
recently saturated ground and snow pack. Storm total liquid
accumulations of 4 to 7 inches along the Sierra crest, 3 to 5
inches in the Tahoe Basin, and 1.5 to 3.5 inches elsewhere in
the Flood Watch, including the Reno/Carson/Minden area.
- Visit CNRFC.noaa.gov and http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop. Be especially cautious at
night when it is harder to recognize the dangers of flooding.</instruction>
