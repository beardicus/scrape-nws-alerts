<headline>Avalanche Watch issued December 30 at 7:31AM PST  by NWS LasVegas</headline>
<description>The Eastern Sierra Avalanche Center in Mammoth Lakes
has issued a Backcountry Avalanche Watch for the
following areas: the Eastern Sierra in Mono County and
the Eastern Sierra in Inyo County
* WHAT...The avalanche danger is expected to rise to HIGH within
the next 24-48 hours. Dangerous avalanche conditions are
expected to continue into tomorrow.
* WHERE...The eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range
between Virgina Lakes on the north to Bishop Creek on the
south.
* WHEN...In effect through 700 AM PST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...A series of large atmospheric river events will bring
periods of heavy snowfall, damaging winds and rain on snow into
the mid elevations stressing an already weak snowpack and
creating dangerous avalanche conditions at all elevations.
* PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...Very dangerous avalanche
conditions are expected to develop as the first system arrives
on Friday December 30 2022. Travel in avalanche terrain is not
recommended. Avalanches may run long distances and can run into
mature forests, valley floors or flat terrain.
Consult http://www.esavalanche.org or
www.avalanche.org for more detailed information
Similar avalanche danger may exist at locations
outside the coverage area of this or any avalanche
center..</description>
