        <headline>High Surf Advisory issued October 27 at 4:31AM EDT until October 30 at 2:00AM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City NC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, strong longshore
currents in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Warning, 2 to 3
ft of inundation above ground level expected in low-lying areas
near shorelines and tidal waterways. For the High Surf Advisory,
large breaking waves of 6 to 10 feet expected in the surf zone.

* WHERE...Ocracoke Island.

* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, from 8 AM EDT this
morning through this evening. For the Coastal Flood Warning,
from 10 PM this evening to 8 PM EDT Wednesday. For the High
Surf Advisory, from 10 PM this evening to 2 AM EDT Thursday.

* IMPACTS...Numerous roads may be closed. Low lying property
including homes, businesses, and some critical infrastructure
will be inundated. Some shoreline erosion will occur. Dangerous
swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach erosion.
Strong longshore currents will create dangerous swimming
conditions.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Gale force NE'rly winds and powerful long
period swell will begin to impact Ocracoke later tonight. As
this occurs, wave runup and ocean overwash are forecast to
develop, especially across the more vulnerable areas of Hwy 12
near Pony Pens where weakened dune structures are noted. Given
the gale force NE'rly winds some minor soundside coastal
flooding (up to 1-2 ft) may also occur starting with the Tue
afternoon high tide cycle as well.
</description>
        <instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.

Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.

Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
