        <headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued October 27 at 2:55PM EDT until October 29 at 11:00AM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City NC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents
and strong longshore currents in the surf zone. For the
Coastal Flood Advisory, 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground
level expected in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of
7 to 10 feet expected in the surf zone.

* WHERE...East Carteret County.

* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, until 8 PM EDT this
evening. For the High Surf Advisory, from 10 PM this evening
to 2 PM EDT Wednesday. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 10
PM this evening to 11 AM EDT Wednesday.

* IMPACTS...Up to 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in a low threat of property damage. Some roads and low
lying property including parking lots, parks, lawns, and homes
adjacent to the waterfront may experience shallow flooding,
especially around high tide. Dangerous swimming and surfing
conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep
even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Strong
longshore currents will create dangerous swimming conditions.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...There is a low end probability that
inundation up to 3 feet above ground level will be possible for
soundside areas in Downeast.

        <instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.

Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.

Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.

Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
