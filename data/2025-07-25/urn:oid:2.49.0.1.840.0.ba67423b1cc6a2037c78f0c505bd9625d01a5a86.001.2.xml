        <description>...KROSA UPGRADED TO TROPICAL STORM...

.NEW INFORMATION...
Krosa has been upgraded to a tropical storm. The Tropical Storm Watch
for Rota, Tinian, Saipan and surrounding waters has been canceled as
of 8 AM. A Tropical Storm Warning is now in effect for Agrihan, Pagan,
and Alamagan.

.AREAS AFFECTED...
This local statement provides information and recommended actions
for people in the Northern Marianas.

.WATCHES/WARNINGS...
The Tropical Storm Watch has been cancelled for Rota, Tinian, and
Saipan.

A Tropical Storm Warning is now in effect for Agrihan, Pagan, and
Alamagan.

Please check the latest public and marine forecasts for detailed
information about additional hazards.

.STORM INFORMATION...
At 7 AM ChST...the center of Tropical Storm Krosa (12W) was
located near latitude 16.5N...longitude 143.3E. This was about
230 miles north-northwest of Guam and 185 miles west-northwest of
Saipan. Storm motion was north, 350 degrees, at 6 mph. Storm intensity
was 40 mph.

.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
Tropical Storm Krosa continues to move north. While it will pass to
the west of the far northern Marianas, it will likely come near enough
to bring tropical storm force winds to the populated islands, namely
Agrihan, Pagan, and Alamagan. Kosra is moving away from Rota, Tinian,
and Saipan, but monsoonal winds south of Krosa will keep winds
elevated.

Tropical Storm Krosa continues to move away from Rota, Tinian, and
Saipan, ending the threat of tropical storm force winds.

.WIND INFORMATION...
A monsoon surge is expected to maintain windy conditions through
Sunday, with southwest winds of 20 to 30 mph. A Wind Advisory has
been issued for these winds.

.COASTAL INUNDATION AND SURF INFORMATION...
Surf along south and west facing reefs will remain at hazardous
levels of 8 to 11 feet through Saturday then begin to diminish. Surf
will probably remain hazardous through Sunday. A High Surf Advisory
and High Risk of Rip Currents have been issued to highlight these.

.OTHER STORM EFFECTS...
Numerous to widespread locally heavy showers will likely continue
through at least Saturday and possibly into Sunday. A Flood Watch
remains in effect. These conditions will taper off Sunday and Sunday
night, then largely normalize on Monday.

        <instruction>.
Seek suitable shelter, such as a cave or other hardened structure.
Have a few days worth of food and water with you, as a monsoon surge
will likely continue for some time after the passage of Tropical Storm
Krosa.</instruction>
