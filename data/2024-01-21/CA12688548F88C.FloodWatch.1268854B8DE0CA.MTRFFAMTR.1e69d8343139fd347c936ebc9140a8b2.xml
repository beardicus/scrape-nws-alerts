<headline>Flood Watch issued January 21 at 9:07PM PST until January 22 at 2:00PM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Minor flooding due to excessive rainfall
* WHERE...Sonoma, Marin, and Napa counties.
* WHEN...Through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water crossings may be
flooded. Storm drains and ditches may become clogged with debris.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rises in creeks and streams likely with this additional round
of rain coming through late Sunday into Monday morning.
Flood-prone areas such as the Mark West Creek near Mirabel
Heights and the Green Valley Creek near Forestville will
likely see minor flooding impacts. Additionally, coastal
mountains could see locally higher rain rates with this
system. Given that soils along hillslopes are saturated,
there is an increased risk of widespread, shallow landslides.
