<headline>High Surf Warning issued January 21 at 3:12PM HST until January 22 at 6:00AM HST by NWS Honolulu</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF WARNING FOR NORTH AND WEST FACING SHORES OF NIIHAU
KAUAI OAHU MOLOKAI AND NORTH FACING SHORES OF MAUI...
...HIGH SURF WARNING FOR WEST FACING SHORES OF BIG ISLAND...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY FOR WEST FACING SHORES OF LANAI...
.A large west-northwest (280-300 degrees) is very slow to ease
this afternoon, so the warnings and advisory are extended through
tonight. Surf heights should dip to advisory levels by Monday
morning as the swell lowers.
...HIGH SURF WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM HST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Surf of 12 to 16 feet.
* WHERE...West facing shores of the Big Island.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM HST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Very High...Expect ocean water surging and sweeping
across beaches, coastal benches, and lava flows creating the
potential for impacts to coastal properties and infrastructure,
including roadways. Powerful longshore and rip currents will be
present at most beaches. Large breaking waves and strong
currents may impact harbor entrances and channels causing
challenging boat handling.</description>
<instruction>Stay away from the shoreline along the affected coasts. Be
prepared for road closures. Postpone entering or leaving channels
affected by the high surf until the surf subsides.</instruction>
