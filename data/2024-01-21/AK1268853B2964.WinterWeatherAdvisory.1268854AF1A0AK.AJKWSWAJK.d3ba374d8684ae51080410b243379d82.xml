<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 21 at 5:57AM AKST until January 22 at 9:00AM AKST by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...HEAVY SNOW FROM PELICAN TO JUNEAU FOR SUNDAY INTO MONDAY...
.A heavy band of snow from a stationary front looks to set up
from Pelican to Juneau Sunday through Monday, with the greatest
rates Sunday night through Monday. Resilient cold air from the
north is expected to remain in place through much of the event,
keeping precipitation as snow. Moisture transport appears to hit
Juneau the hardest, prompting the highest snow totals. At this
time, snow looks to fully transition to a wintry mix and rain
early Tuesday morning. However, this transition will depend on how
fast the incoming front can break through the cold air. It is
possible that this event will be long duration.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO 9 AM AKST
MONDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of up to 7
inches.
* WHERE...Admiralty Island and Western Kupreanof Island and Kuiu
Island, including Angoon and Kake.
* WHEN...From noon today to 9 AM AKST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow is expected to increase in water
content through the duration of the event, becoming increasingly
heavy and wet.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
People are urged to prepare their property before the onset of
winter weather.
