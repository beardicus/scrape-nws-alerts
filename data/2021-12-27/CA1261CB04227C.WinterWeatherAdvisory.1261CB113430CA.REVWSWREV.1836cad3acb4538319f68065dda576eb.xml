<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 27 at 9:35AM PST until December 27 at 7:00PM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM PST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Snow diminishing this afternoon. Additional snow
accumulations of up to one inch. Wind gusts up to 40 mph.
* WHERE...Surprise Valley California, Greater Reno-Carson City-
Minden Area and Northern Washoe County.
* WHEN...Until 7 PM PST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Travel remains very difficult today. Most roads in the
Sierra are closed and sections of Highway 395 are closed due to
whiteout conditions. Winds will continue to produce snow drifts
and whiteout conditions in some areas.</description>
<instruction>Expect major travel delays, especially during periods of high
traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to reach your
destination. Leave extra space between vehicles since it takes
longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
