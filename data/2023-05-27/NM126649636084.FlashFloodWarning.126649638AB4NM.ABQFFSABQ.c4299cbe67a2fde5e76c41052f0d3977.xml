Mesteno, Ojitos Frios Creek, Tecolote Creek, Porvenir Canyon, Arroyo
Pecos, Agua Zarca and Vegosa Creek. The debris flow can consist of
rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.

extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks, streams and ditches
in the Hermits Peak and Calf Canyon Burn Scar. Severe debris flows
can also be anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may be
washed away in places. If you encounter flood waters, climb to
