<instruction>If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.
Torrential rainfall is also occurring with these storms and may lead

Frequent cloud to ground lightning is occurring with these storms.
Lightning can strike 10 miles away from a thunderstorm. Seek a safe
shelter inside a building or vehicle.
If on or near Little Falls Reservoir, get out of the water and move

are close enough to be struck by lightning. Move to safe shelter
now! Do not be caught on the water in a thunderstorm.</instruction>
