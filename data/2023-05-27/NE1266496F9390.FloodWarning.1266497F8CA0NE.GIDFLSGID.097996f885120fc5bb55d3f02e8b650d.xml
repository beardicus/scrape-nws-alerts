<headline>Flood Warning issued May 27 at 8:32PM CDT until May 29 at 1:00AM CDT by NWS Hastings</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in
Nebraska...
Republican River At Cambridge affecting Furnas County.
For the REPUBLICAN RIVER...including Cambridge...Minor flooding is
forecast.
...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY EVENING TO EARLY MONDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Republican River At Cambridge...with this Warning also
valid for the entire Furnas County stretch of the river.
* WHEN...From Sunday evening to early Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...At 9.0 feet, Minor lowland flooding occurs as the right
bank overflows. Water will start flowing through sloughs south of
the main channel.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 7:45 PM CDT Saturday the stage was 6.8 feet and very
slowly rising.
- Forecast...The river is expected to continue a very gradual
rise Saturday night into Sunday, before cresting around the
9.0 foot minor flood stage around 7 PM Sunday evening. It
will then gradually fall below flood stage Sunday night into
Monday morning. Please note that river is now expected to
reach minor flood stage in the Cambridge area later than
previously forecast, and there is even some question whether
it will actually reach minor flood stage or perhaps fall just
short. One factor that could potentially alter the current
forecast is at least some possibility for localized heavy
rain over the Republican River basin Sunday morning, which if
it occurs could result in increased flooding potential.
- Flood stage is 9.0 feet.
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
8.9 feet on 04/25/2007.
