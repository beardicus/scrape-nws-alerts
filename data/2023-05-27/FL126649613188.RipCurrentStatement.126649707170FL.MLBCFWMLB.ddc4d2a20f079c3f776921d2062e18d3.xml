to 8 feet in the surf zone. For the High Rip Current Risk,
dangerous rip currents.

Islands Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 4 PM EDT this

<instruction>High surf will affect the beaches in the advisory area, producing
localized beach erosion and dangerous swimming conditions.
Swimmers should remain out of the water due to large breaking
waves and dangerous surf conditions.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as jetties and
piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.</instruction>
