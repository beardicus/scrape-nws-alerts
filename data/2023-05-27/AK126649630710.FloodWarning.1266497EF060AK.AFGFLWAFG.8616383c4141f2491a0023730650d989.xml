<description>...FLOOD WARNING FOR AN ICE JAM IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AKDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam is imminent.
* WHERE...The Yukon River and Delta for Emmonak and Alakanuk.
* WHEN...Until 600 PM AKDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of the river and delta and other low-lying and
flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1056 AM AKDT, An ice jam downriver from Mountain Village
at Middle Mouth and South Mouth confluence is backing up
water and ice past 10 Mile Island. This ice jam is forcing
water and ice into the Middle Mouth where another ice jam is
in place. Ice ran through South channel past Emmonak
overnight but stopped early Saturday morning and the river is
slowly rising.
Extensive overbank flooding is occurring in lowlands
from Middle-South mouth confluence to Russian Mission,
including significant backwater up the Andreafsky River.
When the ice jams in Middle and South channels
release, expect rapid water level rises and flooding
in Emmonak and Alakanuk. Residents in these communities
and throughout the Yukon River Delta should be prepared
for a long period of high water even after the ice jams
release.
