<description>...SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM CHANCES THROUGH MEMORIAL DAY...
* The active pattern of daily scattered to numerous showers and
thunderstorms will continue through Memorial Day. Storms will be
capable of producing frequent cloud to ground lightning, gusty
outflow winds, small hail, and heavy rainfall.
* With an influx of people enjoying the outdoors this weekend, it
is important that individuals have a way to quickly seek shelter
in the event that a thunderstorm approaches your area. If a
sturdy building is not immediately available, a hard-top vehicle
with the windows rolled up can offer good protection from
lightning. If you plan on doing activities that will leave you
vulnerable to the elements such as hiking, consider doing the
bulk of those activities in the morning hours before
afternoon/evening thunderstorms develop.
* With streams and even mainstem rivers already flowing fast and
cold, it is still advised to avoid swimming in many areas. Keep
in mind that daily showers/thunderstorms will inherently come
with the threat of flash flooding. Have a way to receive weather
alerts, and get to higher ground immediately if a river or
stream you are near begins to rise quickly, if you see debris
floating in the water, or the water suddenly becomes muddy.</description>
