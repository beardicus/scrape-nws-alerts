facing reefs and dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...West facing reefs of Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan.
* WHEN...Through 6 PM ChST Sunday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best

shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
