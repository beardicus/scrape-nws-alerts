<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued May 27 at 3:38AM EDT until May 28 at 10:00AM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM EDT
SUNDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM EDT SUNDAY
NORTH OF CAPE LOOKOUT...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM EDT THIS
MORNING THROUGH THIS EVENING NORTH OF CAPE LOOKOUT...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, 2 to 3 ft of inundation
above ground level in low- lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 7
to 11 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards Statement,
dangerous rip currents, large breaking waves expected, and
strong longshore currents in the surf zone north of Cape
Lookout.
* WHERE...East Carteret County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 10 AM EDT Sunday.
For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 AM EDT Sunday. For the
Beach Hazards Statement, from 8 AM EDT this morning through
this evening.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Dangerous swimming and
surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip currents
can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper
water. Dangerous shore break can throw a swimmer or surfer
head first into the bottom causing neck and back injuries.
Strong longshore currents will create dangerous swimming
conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most likely time for strong rip
currents to occur is a couple hours either side of low tide,
which will occur around 8 AM this morning.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
