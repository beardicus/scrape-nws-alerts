        <headline>Fire Weather Watch issued May 14 at 4:15AM MDT until May 15 at 8:00PM MDT by NWS Albuquerque NM</headline>
        <description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT TODAY FROM 11 AM TO 9 PM FOR THE
NORTHWEST PLATEAU, WEST CENTRAL MOUNTAINS, WEST CENTRAL BASIN AND
RANGE, MIDDLE RIO GRANDE VALLEY, THE SANDIA AND MANZANO MOUNTAINS,
NORTHEAST AND CENTRAL HIGHLANDS, AND THE EAST CENTRAL AND
NORTHEAST PLAINS DUE TO STRONG WIND AND LOW HUMIDITY...

...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT THURSDAY FROM 1 TO 8 PM ACROSS THE
NORTHEAST HIGHLANDS AND PLAINS DUE TO STRONG WIND AND LOW
HUMIDITY...

.Strong southwest winds and very low humidities will return
today as an upper level trough passing north of New Mexico steers
the jetstream over the state. A gusty Pacific cold front will
also cross shifting winds out of the west and northwest during
the late afternoon and evening. Updated Fire Danger Forecasts now
depict high fire danger over the bulk of the area east of the
central mountain chain, so today's Red Flag Warning has been
expanded there. On Thursday, a weaker disturbance passing north of
New Mexico will keep the flow aloft brisk as a surface trough
persists in the lee of the southern Rockies, resulting in another
round of strong winds and critically low humidities. High
temperatures will trend cooler today and Thursday, but mixing
heights won't change much. There will also be fairly widespread
coverage of single digit humidities across south central and
southwest parts of the fire weather forecast area today.

The National Weather Service in Albuquerque has issued a Red Flag
Warning...which is in effect from 11 AM this morning to 9 PM MDT
this evening. A Fire Weather Watch has also been issued. This
Fire Weather Watch is in effect from Thursday afternoon through
Thursday evening.

* AREA AND TIMING...Northeast Highlands (Zone 103) and Northeast
Plains (Zone 104) today from 11 AM to 9 PM MDT and Thursday from
1 to 8 PM.

* 20 FOOT WINDS...For today: southwest 30-40 mph with gusts up to
60 mph. For Thursday: southwest 15-30 mph with gusts up to 40
mph.

* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...11 to 15 percent both days.

* IMPACTS...Any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly.
Outdoor burning is not recommended.
