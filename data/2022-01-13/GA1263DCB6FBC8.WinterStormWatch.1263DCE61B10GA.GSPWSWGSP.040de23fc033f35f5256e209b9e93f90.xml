<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY EVENING
THROUGH MONDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation possible. Total snow
accumulations of 6 to 10 inches across the mountain valleys
and extreme northeast Georgia, 8 to 12 inches along and near
the Blue Ridge Escarpment, and upwards of 12 to 20 inches at
elevations above 4000 feet, and ice accumulations of around
one tenth of an inch possible.
* WHERE...Portions of upstate South Carolina, northeast Georgia
and western North Carolina.
* WHEN...From Saturday evening through Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Precipitation may begin as early as
Saturday afternoon across parts of the mountains, and will
increase in coverage and intensity late Saturday night with a
changeover to all snow in most places. Most of the precipitation
will fall as snow across the mountains and foothills of North
Carolina, northeast Georgia, and Upstate South Carolina. The
precipitation will taper off Sunday afternoon and evening, but
snow will linger along the Tennessee border into Monday morning.
Widespread black ice should be expected Monday morning, and may
be a concern into the middle of the week. Later guidance may
change snow amounts and will determine when a Warning is issued.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Watch means there is a potential for significant
