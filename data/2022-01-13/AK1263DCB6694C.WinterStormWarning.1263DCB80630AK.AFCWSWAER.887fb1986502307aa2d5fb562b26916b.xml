<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 AM AKST
FRIDAY FROM PORTAGE TO THE HOPE CUTOFF...
* WHAT...Heavy snow likely. Total snow accumulations of 12 to 18
inches in Turnagain Pass. Winds could gust as high as 80 mph
through Portage Valley.
* WHERE...Along the Seward Highway from near Portage to the Hope
Cutoff, including Turnagain Pass.
* WHEN...Through 2 AM Friday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult due to heavy, wet
snow through Turnagain Pass. Rain falling on frozen surfaces
along the Seward highway, particularly through Portage Valley,
may cause slick roadways and hazardous driving conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Moderate rain is expected in Seward,
which will extend north to Moose Pass Thursday evening. Urban
areas with snow covered roads will likely see ponding of water
and potentially hazardous travel conditions.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Warning for snow means severe winter weather
conditions will make travel very hazardous. If you must travel,
keep an extra flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case
of an emergency.
