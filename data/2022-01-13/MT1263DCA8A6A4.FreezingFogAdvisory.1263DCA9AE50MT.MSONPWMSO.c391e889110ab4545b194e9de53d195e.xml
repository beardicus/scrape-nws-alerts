* WHEN...For the Freezing Fog Advisory, until 10 AM MST this

<instruction>If driving, slow down, use your headlights, and leave plenty of
distance ahead of you. Also, be alert for frost or ice on bridge
decks causing slippery roads.
People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with high levels of air pollution during
periods of stagnant air.
According to state air quality agencies, prolonged periods of
stagnant air can hold pollutants close to the ground where people
live and breathe. Check with your local burn agency for any
current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
