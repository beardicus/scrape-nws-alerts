<description>...FREEZING FOG ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM MST THIS MORNING...
...AIR STAGNATION ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM MST
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Freezing Fog Advisory, visibility a 1/2 mile or
less at times and patchy ice formation on roads in freezing fog.
Freezing fog is mostly likely from Stevensville northward to
the Missoula Valley. For the Air Stagnation Advisory, an
extended period of stagnant air, with light winds and little
vertical mixing, is expected.
* WHERE...Missoula/Bitterroot Valleys.
* WHEN...For the Freezing Fog Advisory, until 10 AM MST this
morning. For the Air Stagnation Advisory, until 5 PM MST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous driving conditions due to low visibility and
potential frost or ice formation on roadways. Periods of air
stagnation can lead to the buildup of pollutants near the
surface.</description>
<instruction>If driving, slow down, use your headlights, and leave plenty of
distance ahead of you. Also, be alert for frost or ice on bridge
decks causing slippery roads.
People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with high levels of air pollution during
periods of stagnant air.
According to state air quality agencies, prolonged periods of
stagnant air can hold pollutants close to the ground where people
live and breathe. Check with your local burn agency for any
current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
