<description>...STRONG GUSTY WINDS FRIDAY MORNING INTO FRIDAY AFTERNOON...
Southeast winds will increase through the Chugach Mountains after
midnight through Friday morning. Winds are expected to peak
during the morning commute and will begin to diminish Friday
afternoon. Turnagain Arm and higher elevations could experience
southeast winds 35 to 45 mph with gusts as high as 65 mph. In the
Anchorage Bowl, southeast winds sustained at 20 to 30 mph with
gusts 35 to 45 mph are possible. Further north, through the Knik
River Valley and Palmer, winds may linger through the afternoon
with gusts to 45 mph possible.
High profile vehicles should use extra caution when traveling the
Glenn Highway from Anchorage through Chugiak, as crosswinds could
cause hazardous travel, and along the Seward Highway through
Turnagain Arm where the winds will be strongest but highly
variable in intensity. Those in Anchorage through the Matanuska
Valley are encouraged to secure loose items before the winds
increase tonight.</description>
