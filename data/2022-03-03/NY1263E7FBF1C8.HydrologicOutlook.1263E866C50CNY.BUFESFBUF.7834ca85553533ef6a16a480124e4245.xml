<headline>Hydrologic Outlook issued March 03 at 6:06AM EST  by NWS Buffalo</headline>
<description>...ABOVE NORMAL FLOOD RISK THROUGH MARCH 17TH...
This is the fifth flood potential outlook of the 2022 season. Flood
outlooks will be issued every two weeks into early spring to
summarize basin conditions and to assess the potential for flooding.
The outlooks are based on current and forecast hydrometeorological
conditions. This includes snow cover and water equivalent, creek and
river levels and the amount of ice on them, along with the expected
conditions during the next two weeks.
...CURRENT CONDITIONS SUMMARY...
Two warm, rain producing systems during the latter half of February
melted a significant amount of the snow pack across Western New
York. For the Buffalo area creeks, and in the Genesee and Allegheny
River basins these two events melted most of the dense winter
snow pack which was established during January and early February.
Some of the deepest snow pack across higher terrain did survive,
but this only accounts for a small percentage of the area of any
given basin. A couple of light snow events have re-established a
generally nominal snow pack in these basins. Heading into the
outlook period snow water equivalent (SWE) is generally below
normal for these basins.
It`s a bit of a different story for the Black River Basin which did
not get as warm and had a deeper snow pack in place. For lower
terrain, the storm systems melted a good portion of the snow,
however across higher terrain the majority of the deep snow pack did
last. SWE is highly variable with 4 to 8 inches across higher
terrain such as the Tug Hill and the Western Adirondacks.
Climatologically, snow pack is very deep at these locations this
time of year, so these amounts are actually a bit below normal but
still ample to provide significant run-off if there is warm
weather.
A big factor in this outlook is that current flows are running above
normal. This is especially true for larger and or slower responding
rivers. In addition, soil and water storage areas adjacent to creeks
are also full. This can be a factor in more flat and swampy
basins such as Black Creek and Tonawanda Creek
The recent warm weather and high flows have flushed out the vast
majority of ice on area creeks and rivers. There`s a limited amount
of ice still in place in the Black River basin either left over from
early season or ice which has been re-established due to recent cold
weather.
The following is a summary of the conditions at 7 a.m. Thursday
morning, March 3rd:
...BUFFALO AREA CREEKS / LAKE ERIE BASIN...
.SNOW COVER..........1 to 4 inches, except about 6 inches
across the higher terrain of the Boston/Wyoming Hills.
.WATER EQUIVALENT....Half inch or less, except around 2 inches
across the higher terrain of the Boston/Wyoming Hills.
.CREEK FLOWS.........Near normal.
.CREEK ICE...........Little to none.
.GROUND FROST........2 to 6 inches.
.GROUND STATE........Frozen.
...GENESEE RIVER BASIN / FINGER LAKES / ROCHESTER AREA...
.SNOW COVER..........1 to 4 inches.
.WATER EQUIVALENT....Less than two inches.
.CREEK FLOWS.........Above normal.
.CREEK ICE...........Little to none.
.GROUND FROST........2 to 6 inches.
.GROUND STATE........Frozen.
...ALLEGHENY RIVER BASIN...
.SNOW COVER..........1 to 6 inches.
.WATER EQUIVALENT....An inch or less.
.CREEK FLOWS.........Above normal.
.CREEK ICE...........Little to none.
.GROUND FROST........2 to 6 inches.
.GROUND STATE........Frozen.
...BLACK RIVER BASINS / TUG HILL...
.SNOW COVER..........3 to 12 inches, except 1 to 2.5 feet on the Tug
Hill and Adirondacks.
.WATER EQUIVALENT....1 to 2 inches, except 4 to 8 inches on the Tug
Hill and Adirondacks.
.RIVER/CREEK FLOWS...Above normal.
.RIVER/CREEK ICE.....Black River mainly open with areas of ice,
areas of ice variable thickness in feeder creeks.
.GROUND FROST........12 to 20 inches.
.GROUND STATE........Frozen.
...TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION OUTLOOK...
A weak system will produce generally light snow accumulations today,
followed by high pressure and mainly cold and dry weather Friday.
After this, low pressure will track across the central Great Lakes
and bring significantly warmer air into the region with highs on
Sunday topping 60 degrees at some locations. Rainfall amounts will
be modest with this system, with generally about a quarter inch of
rain expected Saturday night and Sunday.
Lower confidence after this, with a frontal boundary expected to be
stalled near our region. If this boundary slides far enough south, a
secondary wave of low pressure will produce mainly snow while
keeping temperatures cool on Monday. However if this boundary
remains across or to the north of the region, then this system has
the potential to produce a half inch to an inch of rainfall.
The remainder of next week looks generally uneventful with no
significant systems anticipated. This is due to a zonal flow aloft
with any systems impacting the region likely to be Canadian sourced
and unlikely to tap into Gulf or Atlantic moisture. However, there
is some indication that a significant system will develop next
weekend although its too far off to know where it will track or what
impacts it would have on our region.
The latest Climate Prediction Center (CPC) 8 to 14 Day Outlook
favors near normal temperatures and above normal precipitation. This
suggests at least the potential for another rain producing system
toward the end of the outlook period.
...FLOOD POTENTIAL OUTLOOK...
Through March 17th the risk for flooding is above normal.
The main concern during the outlook period is the combination of
systems in the Saturday through Monday timeframe. There is high
confidence that Sunday will be warm enough to cause run-off from
snow melt, however rainfall amounts of a quarter inch are unlikely
to cause significant flooding alone. The main concern is that if the
second system on Sunday and Monday brings more rain then there
will be a significant risk for flooding.
Although snow pack is below normal, water storage areas are
saturated and flows are above normal. Black Creek and Tonawanda
Creek will continue to be vulnerable to flooding since water storage
in these basins is full. Will also have to monitor the Allegheny
River since its headwaters are furtherest south and it has the
greatest chance to get rain from the system on Monday.
For most basins, the warm weather Sunday will melt all of the snow
pack, however this will not be the case for the Black River basin
due to the deeper snow pack in place. As a result, later in the
outlook period temperatures will be less important in all basins
except the Black River basin. If the system on Monday does produce
some snow, several days of relatively dry weather during the
remainder of next week would probably gradually melt it without
causing any issues.
Looking ahead, there is a potential for another system towards the
end of the outlook period. If a storm develops its too far off to
know whether it will produce rain or snow.
...ADDITIONAL INFORMATION...
Real time river information and probabilistic forecast for specific
locations along rivers across Western New York can be found on the
internet at www.weather.gov/buf. Since conditions can change, please
refer to the latest flood watches, warnings, and statements for
additional information.
The next Winter/Spring Outlook will be issued on March 17th. We
would like to thank all the observers and agencies which have helped
gather data in support of this outlook.</description>
