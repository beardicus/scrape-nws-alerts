<description>...A WEAK WINTER STORM WILL BRING LIGHT SNOWFALL AND BREEZY WINDS
THIS AFTERNOON INTO SUNDAY MORNING...
* TIMING: Snow showers will continue to develop this afternoon
into the evening. A few light snow showers may continue south
of US-50 into Sunday morning, with other areas clearing between
8 PM and midnight tonight.
* SNOWFALL: Overall snow totals will be light, with up to 2
inches possible. Locally higher amounts up to 4 inches are
possible where heavier bands develop in the Sierra and portions
of western Nevada south of US-50. There is also a chance for
lake-enhanced snow bands forming south of Lake Tahoe and Pyramid
Lake between 8 PM and 4 AM overnight. Concentrated snow
accumulations within these narrow bands could be as high as 1-3
inches. The main impacts from this storm will be icy roads and
travel difficulties where snow falls. Rain may briefly mix with
snow below 5000 feet this afternoon, but snow is expected at all
elevations this evening.
* GUSTY WINDS: Southwest winds across the Sierra have decreased
from their earlier peak, though it will remain cool and breezy
in the mountains. Winds will turn north and then east overnight
with gusts around 50 mph along the Sierra crest by daybreak
Sunday. This will bring turbulence and wind shear concerns to
aviation interests as well as sub-zero wind chills for winter
recreation activities across exposed Sierra ridges. Choppy lake
conditions are also expected on Lake Tahoe through this evening.</description>
