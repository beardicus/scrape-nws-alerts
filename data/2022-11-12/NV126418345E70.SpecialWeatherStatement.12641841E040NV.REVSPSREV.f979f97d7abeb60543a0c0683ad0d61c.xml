<description>...A WEAK WINTER STORM WILL BRING LIGHT SNOWFALL AND GUSTY SIERRA
WINDS TODAY INTO SUNDAY MORNING...
* TIMING: Snow showers will begin to move into northeast
California and the Tahoe Basin this morning, spreading into
western Nevada and the eastern Sierra this afternoon and
evening. A few light snow showers may continue south of US-50
into Sunday morning, with other areas clearing between 8 PM and
midnight tonight.
* SNOWFALL: Overall, snow totals will be light, with up to 2
inches possible. Locally higher amounts up to 4 inches are
possible where heavier bands develop in the Sierra and portions
of western Nevada south of US 50. There is also a chance for
lake-enhanced snow bands forming east-southeast of Lake Tahoe
and Pyramid Lake between 4 PM and midnight tonight. Concentrated
snow accumulations within these narrow bands could be as high
as 2-4 inches. The main impacts from this storm will be icy
roads and travel difficulties where snow falls. Rain may briefly
mix with snow below 5000 feet this afternoon, but snow is
expected at all elevations this morning and later this evening.
* GUSTY WINDS: Gusty southwest winds are expected along the Sierra
Crest today, with breezy easterly winds tonight night into
Sunday. Ridges could gust as high as 70-90 mph today, decreasing
to 40-60 mph Sunday. These gusty winds will bring turbulence and
wind shear concerns to aviation interests as well as sub-zero
wind chills for winter recreation activities across exposed
Sierra ridges. Choppy lake conditions are also expected on Lake
Tahoe.</description>
