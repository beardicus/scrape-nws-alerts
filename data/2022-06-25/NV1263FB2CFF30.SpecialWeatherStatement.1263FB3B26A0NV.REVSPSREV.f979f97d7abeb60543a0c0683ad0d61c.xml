<description>...Isolated Showers and Thunderstorms Today, Warm Temperatures
Through Monday...
Thunderstorms Today:
* Showers and thunderstorms will develop across the eastern Sierra
today and spread northward across the Tahoe Basin during the
afternoon. A few showers and storms will also develop across
western Nevada and gradually move towards the north through the
early evening hours.
* Hazards with these storms include, a mixture of wet and dry
lightning strikes leading to possible new fire starts, and
gusty/erratic outflow winds. Outflow winds from thunderstorms
are capable of capsizing small vessels and reducing visibility
due to blowing dust. Flash flooding caused by locally heavy
rainfall on local burn scars cannot be ruled out.
* Stay aware of weather conditions and have a way to get weather
alerts, especially if you are recreating outdoors. Monitor the
clouds, and if clouds are developing vertically, it is time to
end your activity and prioritize retreating indoors. If you hear
thunder while you`re on the lake or miles into a hike, then you
have already waited too long to seek shelter. Stay away from
recent burn scars as heavy rainfall can create dangerous debris
flows.
Heat Through Monday:
* Warming trend continues through Monday. While nothing too
unusual for late June, high temperatures will run 5 to 10
degrees above average with mid to upper 90s across lower
valleys and 80s in the Sierra valleys. By Monday, many western
Nevada valleys will flirt with the 100 degree mark.
* Most areas will see low to moderate heat risks for sensitive
populations. Consider reducing, canceling or rescheduling
strenuous activities to the coolest time of the day. Individuals
at risk should stay in the coolest available place. Drink plenty
of fluids to stay hydrated and never leave children or animals
in a vehicle.</description>
