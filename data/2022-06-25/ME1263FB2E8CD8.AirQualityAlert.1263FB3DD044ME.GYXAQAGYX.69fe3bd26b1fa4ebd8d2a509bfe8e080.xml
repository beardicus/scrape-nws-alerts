<headline>Air Quality Alert issued June 25 at 3:42PM EDT  by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM TO 11 PM EDT SUNDAY...
The Maine Department of Environmental Protection`s Bureau of Air
Quality has issued an Air Quality Alert for ozone from 11 AM to
11 PM EDT Sunday.
Ozone levels are expected to rise into the Unhealthy for Sensitive
Groups range along the coast from Kittery through Acadia National
Park on Sunday June 26. At elevated ozone levels, children, healthy
adults who exert themselves, and individuals suffering from
respiratory disease such as asthma, bronchitis, or COPD can
experience reduced lung function and irritation. When this happens,
individuals may notice a shortness of breath, coughing, throat
irritation, and/or experience an uncomfortable sensation to their
chest. In addition, particulate pollution levels are expected to be
moderate for the same area. Although temperatures will not reach the
Heat Alert levels, it will be warm so it is important to remember
that even in areas with moderate ozone and particulate pollution the
health impacts will be compounded by the effects of the heat and
humidity.
The Maine Department of Environmental Protection recommends
that individuals consider limiting strenuous outdoor physical
activity to reduce the risk of adverse health effects. People who may
be especially sensitive to the effects of elevated levels of
pollutants include the very young, the elderly, and those with pre-
existing respiratory problems such as asthma and or heart disease.
Those with symptoms should consider consulting their personal
physician.
A toll free air quality hotline has been established so Maine
residents can stay informed on the air quality situations. The toll
free number is: 1-800-223-1196.
Additionally the Maine Department of Environmental Protection has
the air quality forecast available on the web at
