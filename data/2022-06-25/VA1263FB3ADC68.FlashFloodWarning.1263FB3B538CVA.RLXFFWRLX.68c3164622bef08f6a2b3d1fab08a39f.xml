<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued June 25 at 8:10PM EDT until June 25 at 11:15PM EDT by NWS Charleston</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Charleston has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
West Central Dickenson County in southwestern Virginia...
* Until 1115 PM EDT.
* At 810 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing
heavy rain across the warned area. Between 1.5 and 2.5 inches of
rain have fallen. This area has been hit previously in the last
last 3 or 4 hours, therefore flash flood guidance is even lower
this time around. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin
shortly.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban
areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as
other poor drainage and low-lying areas.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Clintwood and Clinchco.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Report flooding to the National Weather Service by calling toll
free, 800 401 9535, when you can do so safely.</instruction>
