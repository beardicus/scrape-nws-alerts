below tropical storm force by late this morning, and will then be
southwest to south 20 to 30 mph with gusts to 40 mph.
...Storm surge and storm tide...
The peak inundation threat has passed but minor inundation of 1 to 2
feet is still possible during high tide around 5 AM this morning.
...Inland flooding...
A Flash Flood Watch remains in effect for the entire area. Additional
rainfall of 2 to 5 inches is possible through Wednesday morning. The
highest amounts are expected for Rota as the more-widespread showers
are found south of the center of Bolaven. See the latest forecasts
for the most up-to-date information. Listen for possible flood
warnings for your location, and be ready to act if flooding rains
occur. Soils are already wet from previous rainfall, so it won`t take
much to cause flooding.</description>
<instruction>Even though Bolaven is moving away from Guam and the CNMI, dangerous
conditions persist and warnings continue. Remain in shelter until
officials have given the all-clear.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for possible changes to the
