<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued October 11 at 2:02AM MDT until October 13 at 6:00AM MDT by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>...HEAVY SNOWFALL POTENTIAL INCREASING FOR THE BLACK HILLS
THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY...
.A potent storm system will bring heavy precipitation and strong
winds to the region today through Friday. Precipitation will
begin as rain today, with some thunderstorms possible this
afternoon and tonight. Colder air wrapping into the system will
allow precipitation to change over to snow across the Black Hills
late tonight into tomorrow morning. Accumulating snow is likely
over much of the Black Hills tomorrow through Friday morning,
particularly across higher elevations of the northern and central
hills. Confidence in precipitation types decreases at elevations
below 4000 feet. However, precipitation will mix with or change
over to snow tomorrow into tomorrow night, particularly within
areas of locally heavier precipitation over the higher foothills.
In these locations, if snow can persist for enough time, several
inches of snow accumulation are possible.
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY MORNING
THROUGH LATE THURSDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 8 to 12
inches, with locally higher amounts possible. Winds could gust
as high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...In South Dakota, the Northern Black Hills and the
Central Black Hills. In Wyoming, the Wyoming Black Hills.
* WHEN...From Thursday morning through late Thursday night.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. Gusty winds could
bring down tree branches.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Watch means heavy snow, strong winds, freezing
precipitation, and cold temperatures are possible. Monitor NOAA
weather radio, local radio or television, or the Internet for
updates on this potentially dangerous storm. Take time to
prepare for severe winter conditions before the storm develops.</instruction>
