<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued July 06 at 9:29PM MDT until July 06 at 11:00PM MDT by NWS Billings</headline>
<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM MDT THIS
EVENING FOR NORTH CENTRAL MUSSELSHELL COUNTY...
At 929 PM MDT, Doppler radar has indicated that thunderstorms have
moved away from the warned area. However various roads, including
Grazing District Road, are currently closed or impassable. Hence,
flash flooding is likely ongoing for at least another hour until the
water and debris move further downstream.
Estimated 3 to 4.5 inches of rain has fallen over the past 6 hours.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,
highways, streets and underpasses as well as other poor
drainage and low-lying areas.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
mainly rural areas of North Central Musselshell County
This includes the following streams and drainages...
Little Wall Creek, North Willow Creek, Willow Creek, Jones Creek,
Crooked Creek and Alkali Creek.
This includes portions of US-87 north of Roundup to the county line.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles. Do not drive on or attempt to cross
flooded roads, find an alternate route. Roads and driveways may be
damaged or washed out in places.
In hilly terrain there are numerous low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Remain alert for flooding of creeks, streams, and normally dry
coulees even in areas not receiving rainfall. These can become
raging killer currents in a matter of minutes even from distant
rainfall upstream.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency officials and
request they pass the information to the National Weather Service in
Billings.</instruction>
