<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued July 06 at 8:18PM MDT until July 06 at 10:00PM MDT by NWS Billings</headline>
<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING FOR THE RICHARD SPRING BURN AREA REMAINS IN
EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM MDT THIS EVENING FOR CENTRAL ROSEBUD COUNTY...
At 818 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing heavy
rain over the Richard Spring Burn Area have now moved east of the
area. Up to 1.75 inches of rain has fallen over the southern portion
of the burn area. Flash flooding is likely ongoing. Though
precipitation has ended, it will take some time for the water and
debris to move downstream and flash flood potential to subside.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through the southern half of the Richard Spring burn area.
The debris flow can consist of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose
materials.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms in and around the
southern half Richard Spring Burn Area.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flooding of areas in and downstream of the Richard
Spring Burn Area.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Ashland, Lame Deer and Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation.
This includes the following streams and drainages...
Standing Elk Creek, Ash Creek, West Fork Ryegrass Creek, Roe and
Cooper Creek, Tongue River, South Fork Lame Deer Creek, Rye Grass
Creek, South Fork Alderson Creek, Rosebud Creek, Cow Creek,
Alderson Creek, Broken Jaw Creek, Stebbins Creek, Lame Deer Creek,
Greenleaf Creek, Lake Creek, Walking Horse Creek, Miller Creek,
West Fork Miller Creek, Reservation Creek and Logging Creek.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Life threatening flooding of creeks, roads, and normally dry coulees
in and downstream of the Richard Spring Burn Area burn area is
likely. In addition to the flash flooding, the heavy rains may
trigger rockslides, mudslides, and debris flows in steep terrain.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Do not
drive on or attempt to cross flooded roads, find an alternate route.
Roads and driveways may be damaged or washed out in places.
Remain alert for flooding of creeks, streams, and normally dry
coulees even in areas not receiving rainfall downstream of the burn
area. These can become raging killer currents in a matter of minutes
even from distant rainfall upstream.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency officials and
request they pass the information to the National Weather Service in
Billings.</instruction>
