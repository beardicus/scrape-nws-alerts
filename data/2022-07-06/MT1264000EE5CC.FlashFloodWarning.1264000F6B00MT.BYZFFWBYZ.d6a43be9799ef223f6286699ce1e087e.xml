<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued July 06 at 6:59PM MDT until July 06 at 10:00PM MDT by NWS Billings</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Billings has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
The Richard Spring Burn Area in...
Central Rosebud County in southeastern Montana...
* Until 1000 PM MDT.
* At 659 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing
heavy rain over the southern portion of the Richard Spring Burn
Area. Between 0.5 and 1.5 inches of rain have fallen. Additional
rainfall amounts up to 1 inch are possible in the warned area.
Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through drainages over the southern half of the Richard
Spring burn area, along US-212. The debris flow can consist of rock,
mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms in and around
the southern half of the Richard Spring Burn Area.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flooding of areas in and downstream of the southern
half of the Richard Spring Burn Area.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Ashland, Lame Deer and Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Remain alert for flooding of creeks, streams, and normally dry
coulees even in areas not receiving rainfall downstream of the burn
area. These can become raging killer currents in a matter of minutes
even from distant rainfall upstream.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency officials and
request they pass the information to the National Weather Service in
Billings.</instruction>
