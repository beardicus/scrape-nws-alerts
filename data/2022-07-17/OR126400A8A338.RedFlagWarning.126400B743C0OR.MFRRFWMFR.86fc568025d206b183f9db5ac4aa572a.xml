A Red Flag Warning does not mean there is a fire. It means that
critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now or will
shortly. These conditions promote rapid spread of fire which may
become life threatening. Evacuate if ordered to, or if a fire
threatens.
Plan now to avoid using equipment that could cause sparks during
the period when critical weather conditions are possible. Visit
weather.gov/medford/wildfire for links to fire restrictions in
your area.</description>
