<headline>Red Flag Warning issued July 17 at 9:13PM PDT until July 18 at 8:00PM PDT by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...Gusty winds with low RH Monday...
.An upper level trough over Washington will reach the Rockies on
Monday. Though winds will not be quite as strong as they were
today, this will produce gusty winds again Monday afternoon. In
combination with very low relative humidities, this will likely
result in critical fire weather conditions again in Modoc County.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM TO 8 PM PDT MONDAY
FOR STRONG GUSTY WIND WITH LOW RH FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONE 285...
* Impacts:  Strong, gusty wind with low relative humidity and
critically dry vegetation will greatly increase the spread
potential of any new and existing fires.
* Affected area:
In Northern CA...Fire Weather Zone 285.
* Wind: Southwest 10 to 20 mph with gusts up to 30 mph.
* Humidity: 8 to 12 percent.

Precautionary/preparedness actions...
Avoid tossing burning cigarettes on the ground, parking hot
vehicles on dry vegetation, and using equipment that can cause
sparks. Follow all fire restrictions. Find links to restrictions
at weather.gov/medford/wildfire. One less spark, one less
wildfire.
A Red Flag Warning does not mean there is a fire. It means that
critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now or will
shortly. These conditions promote rapid spread of fire which may
become life threatening. Evacuate if ordered to, or if a fire
threatens.
