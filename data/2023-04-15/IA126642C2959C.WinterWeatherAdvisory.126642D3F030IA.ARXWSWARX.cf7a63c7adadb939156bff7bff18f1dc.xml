<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued April 15 at 8:27PM CDT until April 17 at 10:00AM CDT by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Band of Heavy Snow Expected Sunday Evening to Monday
Morning...
.A complex storm system will impact the region Sunday into Monday
morning with rain changing to snow during the day Sunday.
Snowfall amounts during the day on Sunday will be tempered due to
melting.
However, as the sun sets and temperatures fall, the risk for
accumulating snow will quickly increase with most accumulations
occurring Sunday night. Within the band, rates of 1 to 2 inches
per hour will be possible, and these rates likely will overcome
warmer road surfaces, leading to snow-covered, hazardous travel
for a time. Although current trends favor areas near the
Mississippi River eastward into central and western Wisconsin for
the snow band, there is some uncertainty in exactly where the
narrow snow band will set up. Continue to monitor forecast for
updates on this spring storm.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM SUNDAY TO
10 AM CDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 3
inches. Winds gusting as high as 45 to 50 mph.
* WHERE...Winneshiek, Allamakee, Fayette and Clayton Counties.
* WHEN...From 1 PM Sunday to 10 AM CDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning commute. Gusty winds could
bring down tree branches.</description>
