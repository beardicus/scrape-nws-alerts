Water levels can rise rapidly and sweep children away.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.

enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
