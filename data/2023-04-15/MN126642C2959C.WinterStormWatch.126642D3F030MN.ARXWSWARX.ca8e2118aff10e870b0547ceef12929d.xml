<description>...Band of Heavy Snow Expected Sunday Evening to Monday
Morning...
.A complex storm system will impact the region Sunday into Monday
morning with rain changing to snow during the day Sunday.
Snowfall amounts during the day on Sunday will be tempered due to
melting.
However, as the sun sets and temperatures fall, the risk for
accumulating snow will quickly increase with most accumulations
occurring Sunday night. Within the band, rates of 1 to 2 inches
per hour will be possible, and these rates likely will overcome
warmer road surfaces, leading to snow-covered, hazardous travel
for a time. Although current trends favor areas near the
Mississippi River eastward into central and western Wisconsin for
the snow band, there is some uncertainty in exactly where the
narrow snow band will set up. Continue to monitor forecast for
updates on this spring storm.
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY EVENING
THROUGH MONDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 4 to 8
inches, however higher amounts of 8 to 12 inches of snow could
occur where the heavier band sets up. Winds could gust as high
as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of southeast Minnesota and central, north
central, southwest and west central Wisconsin.
* WHEN...From Sunday evening through Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning commute.</description>
