- At 129 PM CDT, gauge reports and trained spotters indicated
river rises and flooding due to snowmelt. Minor flooding is
already occurring in the advisory area.
- Rain this weekend will increase the rate of snowmelt. The
resultant runoff will cause water levels in area rivers to
increase and flooding is expected to continue.

dangers of flooding.</instruction>
