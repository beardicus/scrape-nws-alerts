<description>...Band of Moderate to Heavy Snow Expected Sunday Evening to
Monday Morning...
.A complex storm system impacts the region Sunday into Monday
morning with rain changing to snow during the day Sunday. Snowfall
amounts during the day on Sunday will be tempered due to melting.
However, as the sun sets and temperatures drop Sunday night, the
risk for accumulating snow will quickly increase.
The snow overnight Sunday into Monday morning is expected to fall
in a relatively narrow band, making predicting exact snow amounts
at a given location challenging. However, there is increasing
confidence that this band will impact far southeast Minnesota into
west-central Wisconsin along and north of the Interstate 90
corridor. Snowfall rates in the band may exceed an inch per hour
with total snow amounts of 4 to 7 inches--locally higher in some
locales--by the time the storm ends Monday morning. Winds gusting
to 35 to 45 mph will further reduce visibilities and worsen
travel impacts. Travelers should be prepared for impacts for the
Monday morning commute.
...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY EVENING THROUGH
MONDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 4 to 7
inches with locally higher amounts possible. Northwest winds
could gust as high as 35 to 45 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of southeast Minnesota and central, north
central, southwest and west central Wisconsin.
* WHEN...From Sunday evening through Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning commute.</description>
