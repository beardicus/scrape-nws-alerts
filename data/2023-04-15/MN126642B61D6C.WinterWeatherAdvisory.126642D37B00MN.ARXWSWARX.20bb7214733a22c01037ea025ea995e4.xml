<description>...Band of Moderate to Heavy Snow Expected Sunday Evening to
Monday Morning...
.A complex storm system impacts the region Sunday into Monday
morning with rain changing to snow during the day Sunday.
Snowfall amounts during the day on Sunday will be tempered due to
melting. However, as the sun sets and temperatures drop Sunday
night, the risk for accumulating snow will quickly increase.
The heaviest snow overnight Sunday into Monday morning is
expected to fall in a relatively narrow band, making predicting
exact snow amounts at a given location challenging. However,
there is increasing confidence that this band could impact far
southeast Minnesota into west-central Wisconsin along and north
of the Interstate 90 corridor. Snowfall rates in the band may
exceed an inch per hour with total snow amounts of 6 to 12
inches-- locally higher in some locales--by the time the storm
ends Monday morning. Winds gusting to 40 to 50 mph will further
reduce visibilities and worsen travel impacts. Travelers should be
prepared for impacts for the Monday morning commute.
There is still some uncertainty in how far west the heavy snow
will extend. Continue to monitor forecast for updates on this
spring storm.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM SUNDAY TO 7 AM
CDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 3
inches. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Wabasha, Dodge, Olmsted, Mower and Fillmore Counties.
* WHEN...From 10 AM Sunday to 7 AM CDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Patchy blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions
could impact the morning commute. Gusty winds could bring down
tree branches.</description>
