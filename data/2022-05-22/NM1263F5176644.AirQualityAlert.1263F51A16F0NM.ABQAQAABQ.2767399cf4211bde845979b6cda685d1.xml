<headline>Air Quality Alert issued May 22 at 7:37PM MDT  by NWS Albuquerque</headline>
<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT...
The following message is transmitted at the request of the New Mexico
Departments of Health and Environment, United States Forest Service
and the Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality Response Program.
* WHAT...Continued cooler temperatures and higher humidity have
reduced fire growth and smoke production, especially in the
northeast. Western New Mexico will have warmer temperatures and
strong southwesterly winds which will shift to the south with breezy
to windy conditions prevailing. While smoke from active fires is
expected to move to the northeast of fires, a persistent south and
southeast wind through the New Mexico`s central valley will continue
to spread smoke northward from Socorro to the Albuquerque metro
area, and northwestward from Socorro to Grants, for the remainder of
tonight. Southwest winds will develop Monday morning, clearing the
smoke from the Grants and Albuquerque areas. Smoke from other
wildfires and localized blowing dust will contribute to increasingly
hazy skies.
* WHERE...Locations mostly likely to experience the most significant
impacts from smoke include the western Socorro County, with moderate
impacts in Bernalillo, Valencia, eastern Cibola, and central and
eastern Socorro Counties. Details on impacted locations and the
latest air quality information can be found at:
https://fire.airnow.gov.
* WHEN...The remainder of this evening through at least 1 PM MDT
Monday, May 23.
* IMPACTS...Those with conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and heart
disease will be especially vulnerable to impacts from poor air
quality, as will adults over age 65, young children, and pregnant
women if smoke concentrations become unhealthy.
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method available
at https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/IndoorQuality.html and
https://cv.nmhealth.org
New Mexicans will also need to take steps to keep their homes cool to
avoid heat-related illnesses. NMDOH offers tips here:
