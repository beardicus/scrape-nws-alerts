<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued May 22 at 2:52PM MDT until May 24 at 8:00PM MDT by NWS El Paso</headline>
<description>...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED ON TUESDAY...
.An upper level system will approach New Mexico Tuesday afternoon
with an increase in winds expected. Very low humidity (6 to 12
percent) is anticipated across much of southwest and south-central
New Mexico, and coupled with the breezy to windy conditions (20
ft winds 20 to 25 mph), in addition to very dry fuels, critical
fire weather conditions are anticipated. Farther east across far
west Texas and the Sacramento mountains, there is uncertainty in
the wind speeds. Consequently, the Fire Weather Watch has been
omitted from these locations at this time.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
TUESDAY EVENING FOR STRONG WINDS AND LOW HUMIDITY FOR FIRE
WEATHER ZONES 110, 111, AND 112...
