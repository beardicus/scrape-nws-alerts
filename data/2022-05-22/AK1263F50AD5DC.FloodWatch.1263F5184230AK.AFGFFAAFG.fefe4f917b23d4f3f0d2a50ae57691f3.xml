<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM AKDT
THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues to be possible.
* WHERE...The Yukon River from Grayling to Russian Mission, and
along the Innoko River from Shageluk to 20 miles upstream.
* WHEN...Until 10 PM AKDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...A large ice jam upriver from Graying released yesterday
and led to a significant ice jam run with rising water levels in
Grayling this morning. The ice run has begun to think out but
water levels still remain near bankfull. Residents in Anvik, Holy
Cross, and Russia Mission will see a rapid rise in water levels
over the next 24 hours. Water levels will rise to bankfull in some
locations along with bank to bank runs of ice moving downriver.
Additionally, the previous ice jam upriver from Grayling has
caused a significant amount of water to flow over the banks of the
Yukon River and into the Innoko River. River levels on the Innoko
will continue to be high, though should begin to recede over the
next couple of days as the dammed up water upstream on the Yukon
flows downstream.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- An ice jam may cause water to infiltrate the lowlands along
the river.</description>
<instruction>Residents are encouraged to monitor water levels along these areas
of the Yukon and Innoko Rivers, and move items near the riverbank to
higher ground.</instruction>
