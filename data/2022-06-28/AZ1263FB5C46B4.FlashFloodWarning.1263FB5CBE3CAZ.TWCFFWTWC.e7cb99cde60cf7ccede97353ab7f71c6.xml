Move to higher ground now. Act quickly to protect your life.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry washes is likely. The heavy rains will
likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
A Flash Flood Warning means that flooding is imminent or occurring.

Residents living along streams and creeks should take immediate
precautions to protect life and property.</instruction>
