<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM AKDT THIS MORNING
THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Including the following area, Southeastern Brooks Range.
This includes the cities of Arctic Village, Wiseman, Coldfoot,
Chandalar Dot Camp, And Iniakuk Lake.
* WHEN...From 10 AM AKDT this morning through Sunday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Low-water
crossings may be flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Thunderstorms with heavy rain showers moved across the
Eastern Brooks Range Friday night into this morning. A more
widespread area of heavy showers is expected to move over the
Eastern Brooks Range today. Between 0.50 inch and 1.5 inches
of rain is expected to fall today. It is uncertain exactly
which river basins will get the heaviest rain. The heavy rain
will fall in a short period of time meaning that creeks and
small rivers in steep terrain could rise very rapidly today
in the areas that get the heaviest rain. Larger rivers will
rise tonight and Sunday, but at this time it is uncertain if
larger rivers will flood.
- Http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood
People in the Brooks Range should be alert to the possibility of
rapidly rising water levels along creeks and small rivers today, and
along larger rivers tonight.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
