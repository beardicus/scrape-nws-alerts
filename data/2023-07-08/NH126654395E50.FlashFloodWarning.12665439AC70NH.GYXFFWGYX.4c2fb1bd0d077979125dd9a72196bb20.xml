<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
It is important to know where you are relative to streams, rivers,
or creeks which can become killers in heavy rains. Campers and
hikers should avoid streams or creeks.</instruction>
