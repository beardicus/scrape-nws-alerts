- Several rounds of showers and thunderstorms are expected
Sunday night through Monday night. Storm total amounts range
from 1.5 to 3 inches across the watch area, but localized
higher amounts are possible especially where thunderstorms
develop. Thunderstorms will have the potential to produce
rainfall rates in excess of 1 inch per hour, which will
elevate the risk of urban and street flooding along with
localized flash flooding. The greatest risk for storms will
be across northern Connecticut, western and central
Massachusetts.
