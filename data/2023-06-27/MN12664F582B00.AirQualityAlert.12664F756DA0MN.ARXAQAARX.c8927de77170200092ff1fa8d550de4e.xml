<headline>Air Quality Alert issued June 27 at 9:24AM CDT  by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT THROUGH 12 AM CDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has issued an Air
Quality Advisory FOR fine particle pollution. The Air Quality Index
(AQI) is expected to reach the Orange or Unhealthy category for
Sensitive Groups.
* WHERE...Southeast Minnesota.
* WHEN...Through 12 AM CDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease
(including asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults,
may experience health effects.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Smoke from wildfires in Ontario and Quebec
moved into eastern and southern Minnesota late Monday, and ground-
level smoke has persisted through the early Tuesday morning. High
pressure has moved into the state and will result in very light winds
across eastern Minnesota on Tuesday. As a result, ground-level smoke
is expected to linger across the alert area on Tuesday. Winds will
become southerly Tuesday afternoon and air quality may improve across
northeast Minnesota by Wednesday. However, the smoke currently
impacting Wisconsin is expected to recirculate into southern
Minnesota, and ground-level smoke is expected to persist across
southern and east central Minnesota on Wednesday. A cold front will
move across the state Wednesday afternoon and bring cleaner air from
the west. Air quality should improve statewide by midnight Thursday.
Fine particle levels are expected to reach the orange air quality
index (AQI) category, a level considered unhealthy for sensitive
groups, across southeast Minnesota. This area includes Rochester and
Winona. In the orange area, sensitive groups should limit prolonged
or heavy exertion and time spent outdoors.

<instruction>Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including
asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults, should
limit prolonged or heavy exertion.
Reduce or eliminate activities that contribute to air pollution,
such as outdoor burning, and use of residential wood burning
devices. Reduce vehicle trips and vehicle idling as much as
possible.
Keep windows closed overnight to prevent smoke from getting
indoors.</instruction>
