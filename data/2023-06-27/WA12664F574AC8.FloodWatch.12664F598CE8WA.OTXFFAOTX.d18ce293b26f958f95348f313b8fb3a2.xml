<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM PDT THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of North Central Washington, including the
following counties, Chelan and Okanogan.
* WHEN...From 1 PM PDT this afternoon through this evening.

streams, and other flood-prone locations like burn scars. Some of
the burned areas included in the Flash Flood Watch are the Red
Apple, 25 Mile, Cedar Creek, Cub Creek, and Muckamuck burn scars.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Atmospheric conditions will once again favor slow moving
thunderstorms capable of locally heavy rain this afternoon
and early this evening. Steep terrain and burned areas in
Chelan and Okanogan counties will be particularly vulnerable
to flash flooding. Runoff will be capable of producing rapid
rises on creeks as well as producing rock and mud slides.
