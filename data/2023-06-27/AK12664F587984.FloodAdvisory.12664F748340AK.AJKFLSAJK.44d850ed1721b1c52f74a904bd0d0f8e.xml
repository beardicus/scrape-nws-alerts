<headline>Flood Advisory issued June 27 at 8:25AM AKDT  by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY FOR A GLACIER-DAMMED LAKE OUTBURST IN EFFECT UNTIL
8 AM AKDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by a glacier-dammed lake outburst is
expected.
* WHERE...The Taku River and areas along the Taku Inlet.
* WHEN...Until 800 AM AKDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 800 AM AKDT, river gauge reports indicate rises in water
levels from a glacier-dammed lake outburst in areas along the
Taku River and Inlet. Rapid river rises will cause minor
flooding.
- Mariners in the area of the river and Taku Inlet should watch
for additional debris in the water.
- For Taku River near Juneau:
At 8:00am the stage was 40.82 feet.
Flood Stage is 43.0 feet.
Forecast: A crest around 43.6 feet is expected around 10:00
pm Tuesday.
Impacts:
At 43.3 feet: The water level will be at the top of the hill
in front of the house near the gauge.
- Inherent uncertainty in initial glacier lake volume will
result in varying crest height and timing.
- If you live near or along the Taku River, stay alert and be
prepared to take action.
- The cold water temperatures can increase the threat of
hypothermia and lower the time required to cause hypothermia.</description>
<instruction>Stay tuned to further developments by listening to your local radio,
television, or NOAA Weather Radio for further information.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.</instruction>
