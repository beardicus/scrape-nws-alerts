<description>...RELEASE OF GLACIER DAMMED LAKE ON THE SALMON RIVER NEAR HYDER...
WATER LEVELS ON THE SALMON RIVER NEAR HYDER, ALASKA BEGAN RISING
BEYOND THE NORMAL DAILY RISE ON SUNDAY NIGHT. THE RIVER HAS BEEN
RISING AT APPROXIMATELY 1 FOOT IN 18 HOURS. IN THE PAST THIS EVENT
IS ABOUT 4 DAYS LONG FROM START TO FINISH, WHICH WOULD PUT THE CREST
ON THURSDAY THE 29TH. HOWEVER, THIS IS AN EARLIER THAN NORMAL
RELEASE FROM SUMMIT LAKE SO THERE MAYBE LESS VOLUME OF WATER WITH
LESS TIME TO FILL FROM SNOW MELT.
MARINERS IN THE AREA OF THE RIVER AND PORTLAND CANAL SHOULD WATCH
FOR ADDITIONAL DEBRIS IN THE WATER AND BE AWARE OF COLDER WATER
TEMPERATURES.
WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE RIVER IN COORDINATION WITH THE
ALASKA PACIFIC RIVER FORECAST CENTER AND THE US FOREST SERVICE IN
HYDER.</description>
