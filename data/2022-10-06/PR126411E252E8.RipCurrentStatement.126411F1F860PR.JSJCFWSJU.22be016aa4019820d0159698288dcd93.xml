<headline>Rip Current Statement issued October 06 at 4:46AM ADT until October 07 at 7:00AM ADT by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Breaking wave heights between 6 and 9 feet may cause
strong sweeping currents along coastlines.
* WHERE...North facing beaches in Culebra, Puerto Rico.
* WHEN...Through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Inexperienced swimmers may become in danger if
caught in these currents.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.</instruction>
