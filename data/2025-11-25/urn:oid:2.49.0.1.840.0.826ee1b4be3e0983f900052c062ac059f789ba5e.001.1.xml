        <headline>Lake Effect Snow Warning issued November 25 at 8:46PM EST until November 29 at 1:00AM EST by NWS Cleveland OH</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...Heavy lake effect snow expected. Total snow accumulations
between 8 and 12 inches are likely over much of the area. Locally
higher amounts are possible across inland Erie County PA where a
few locations could see up to 18 inches of snow. Winds gusting as
high as 50 mph.

* WHERE...Northern Erie and Southern Erie Counties.

* WHEN...From 1 AM Thursday to 1 AM EST Saturday.

* IMPACTS...Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will
likely become slick and hazardous. Visibilities may drop below 1/4
mile due to falling and blowing snow. The strong winds may down
power lines and could cause sporadic power outages. Whiteout
conditions are expected and will make travel treacherous and
potentially life-threatening. Travel could be very difficult to
impossible. The hazardous conditions could impact busy
Thanksgiving holiday travel.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Lake effect snow will clip portions of far
northern Erie County late Wednesday night into Thursday morning
before the band moves inland. Intensity of snowbands is expected
to increase throughout the day when snow may quickly accumulate on
untreated surfaces. Heaviest snowfall will occur Thursday morning
and early afternoon, and again overnight Thursday, where snowfall
rates could reach 1 to 2 inches per hour.

        <instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.

The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and Pennsylvania
Turnpike Commission strongly encourage motorists to heed all travel
restrictions and delay unnecessary travel. Visit www.511pa.com for
the latest travel, roadway, and traffic conditions.

Persons should consider delaying all travel. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution. Consider taking a winter
storm kit along with you, including such items as tire chains,
booster cables, flashlight, shovel, blankets and extra clothing.
Also take water, a first aid kit, and anything else that would help
you survive in case you become stranded.

During lake effect snow, the weather can vary from bands of locally
heavy snow to dry weather just a few miles away. Visibilities can
also vary greatly. Be prepared for rapid changes in weather,
visibility, and road conditions.</instruction>
