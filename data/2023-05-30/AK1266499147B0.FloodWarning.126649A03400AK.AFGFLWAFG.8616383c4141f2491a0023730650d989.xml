<description>...FLOOD WARNING FOR AN ICE JAM NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AKDT
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues.
* WHERE...The Yukon River and delta for Emmonak and Alakanuk.
* WHEN...Until 600 PM AKDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of the river and delta and other low-lying and
flood-prone locations is occurring.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 2 PM, An ice jam at the terminus of the South Mouth of the
Yukon River caused water to backup and flood communities in
the Yukon Delta, including Emmonak and Alakanuk. On Monday,
satellite imagery revealed that the ice jam broke and flushed
out into the Bering Sea. Water levels in Emmonak and Alakanuk
have begun to subside but significant flooding of roads and
structures in these communities is still occurring as the
water backed up behind the ice jam slowly recedes.
Residents should be prepared for a long period of high water
as upstream snow melt works its way downstream.
