<headline>Flood Warning issued May 30 at 11:54PM CDT  by NWS Goodland</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM CDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...A portion of northwest Kansas, including the following
counties, Graham and Sheridan.
* WHEN...Until 400 AM CDT.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring. Low-water
crossings are inundated with water and may not be passable. Expect
many areas of slow moving or standing water. It will take several
hours for all the water from these storms to work through local
drainage systems in urban areas.

rainfall across the warned area. Between 2 and 4 inches of
rain have fallen.
- This includes the following streams and drainages...
MIdway Draw, Jackson Branch, Southwest Fork County Line
Creek, South Fork Solomon River, Leeds Draw, South Martin
Creek, North Creek, Southeast Fork County Line Creek, North
Fork Saline River, East Creek, Midway Draw, Brush Creek, Sand
Creek, Turner Draw, Cow Draw, Museum Creek, County Line
Creek, Happy Creek, Gove Creek, Saline River and Rock Creek.
Additional rainfall amounts of 0.5 to 1.5 inches are possible
in the warned area.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Morland, Saint Peter, Studley, Tasco and Penokee.

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
