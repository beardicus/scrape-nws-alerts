<description>...Brief Landspout Tornadoes Possible...
At 528 PM MDT, conditions are becoming favorable for the development
of landspout tornadoes in and close to the rural areas of northwest
Hamilton County. However, at this time it is unknown which if any
storm would produce a landspout. Any landspouts which develop are
expected to pose a limited threat.
This landspout threat will remain over mainly rural areas of
northwestern Hamilton County.
Landspout tornadoes can form with a developing thunderstorm before
rain, hail, and even thunder is observed. Landspout tornadoes are not
usually associated with a wall cloud and are often difficult to
detect with weather radar.
