<description>...FLASH FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible this afternoon and evening.
* WHERE...Portions of California and Nevada, including the following
areas, in California, Greater Lake Tahoe Area, Lassen-Eastern
Plumas-Eastern Sierra Counties, Mono County and Surprise Valley
California. In Nevada, Greater Lake Tahoe Area, Greater
Reno-Carson City-Minden Area, Mineral and Southern Lyon Counties
and Northern Washoe County.
* WHEN...Through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other flood-prone locations. Area creeks and
streams are running high and could flood with heavy rain.
Extensive street flooding is also possible in urbanized locations.
Debris flows possible in and around burn scars.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Slow moving showers and thunderstorms will produce areas of
heavy rainfall during the afternoon and evening hours. Soils
are already saturated with creeks, streams, and rivers
running full due to ongoing snowmelt. It will not take as
much rain to cause excessive runoff. Also, heavy rainfall may
lead to flash flooding and debris flows in and around burn
scars.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action
should Flash Flood Warnings be issued. If you are camping or hiking
in flash flood-prone areas, make note of escape routes in case you
have to get to quickly get to higher ground.
If you come across a flooded roadway, do not attempt to cross it.
Turn Around, Don`t Drown!</instruction>
