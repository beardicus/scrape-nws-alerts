<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued May 30 at 3:55AM EDT until May 30 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Wakefield</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM EDT THIS
MORNING THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Dangerous rip currents and large breaking waves.
* WHERE...In Maryland, coastal Worcester County including Ocean
City and Assateague. In Virginia, Atlantic facing beaches of
Accomack and Northampton Counties.
* WHEN...From 8 AM EDT Tuesday through Tuesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw a swimmer or
surfer head first into the bottom causing neck and back
injuries.</description>
<instruction>Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
