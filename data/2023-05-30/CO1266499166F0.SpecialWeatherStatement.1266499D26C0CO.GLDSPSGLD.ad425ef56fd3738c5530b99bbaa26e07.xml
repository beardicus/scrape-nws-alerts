<description>...Brief Landspout Tornadoes Possible...
At 459 PM MDT, conditions are becoming favorable for the development
of landspout tornadoes from Cheyenne Wells to Weskan and Tribune.
However, at this time it is unknown which if any storm would produce
a landspout. Any tornadoes which develop are expected to pose a
limited threat.
This landspout threat will remain over mainly rural areas of
southeastern Cheyenne County County in east central Colorado,
southwestern Wallace and western Greeley Counties in west central
Kansas.
Landspout tornadoes can form with a developing thunderstorm before
rain, hail, and even thunder is observed. Landspout tornadoes are not
usually associated with a wall cloud and are often difficult to
detect with weather radar.
