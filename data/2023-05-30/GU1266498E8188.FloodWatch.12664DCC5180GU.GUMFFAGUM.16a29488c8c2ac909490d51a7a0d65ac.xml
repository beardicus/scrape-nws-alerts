<headline>Flood Watch issued May 30 at 2:02PM ChST  by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE THURSDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall and poor
drainage is possible.
* WHERE...Guam.
* WHEN...Through late Thursday night.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Storm drains
and ditches may become clogged with debris. Compromised trees
could fall with further soil saturation. Slides are possible with
excessive runoff in steep terrain and cliff areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Saturated soils, clogged drains and debris have been left
across the island in the wake of Mawar. More heavy rain late
last night and today has increased soil saturation and lead
to flooding across the island. A wet pattern with more rounds
of heavy showers and thunderstorms is expected through
Thursday night. The best potential for flooding looks to be
Wednesday night into Thursday.
