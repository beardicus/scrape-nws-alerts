<headline>Flood Advisory issued January 02 at 8:25PM PST  by NWS Seattle</headline>
<description>.Heavy rainfall across portions of Snohomish and King counties,
combined with melting snow, may cause minor urban flooding this
evening.
...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 1130 PM PST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Urban and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of west central Washington, including King and
Snohomish counties.
* WHEN...Until 1130 PM PST.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
Water over roadways.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 821 PM PST, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated heavy rain continuing to fall across the area, with
between 0.50 and 1.25 inches of rain falling in the last
three hours across the advisory area. This, combined with
melting snow or slush from recent snowfall, may be enough to
cause ponding of water on roadways, especially if drains
become blocked. Heavy rainfall continues this evening.
