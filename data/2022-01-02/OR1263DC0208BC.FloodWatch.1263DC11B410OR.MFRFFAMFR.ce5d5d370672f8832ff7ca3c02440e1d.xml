<senderName>NWS Medford (Southwest Oregon and Northern California)</senderName>
<headline>Flood Watch issued January 02 at 10:31AM PST until January 03 at 1:00PM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>.A series of fronts is likely to bring periods of moderate to heavy
precipitation totaling 2 to 6 inches of water over much of
southwestern Oregon and far northwestern California tonight, January
2nd, into Wednesday, January 5th. Snow levels will generally rise
during this time period leading to melting of the lower elevation
snowpack across the area. This will lead to rapid rises on area
streams, creeks, and rivers, as well as possible flooding during
this time period.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY MORNING THROUGH WEDNESDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Rapid water level rises and possible localized flooding
caused by excessive rainfall and snow melt is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of northern California and southwest Oregon,
including the following areas, in northern California, western
Siskiyou County. In southwestern Oregon, western and central
Douglas County, Coos County, Curry County, and much of Josephine
County.
* WHEN...From Monday morning through Wednesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff will result in rapid rises and possible
localized flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations. Creeks and streams may rise out of
their banks. Low-water crossings may be flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Extensive low elevation snow pack with heavy rain on it over
the next 2 to 3 days will lead to the possibility of
localized flooding of streams, creeks, and low lying areas.
