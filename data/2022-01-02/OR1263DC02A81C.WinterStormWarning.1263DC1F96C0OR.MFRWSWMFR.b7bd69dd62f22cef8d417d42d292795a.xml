TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Gusty winds will continue to increase peaking from
northwest to southeast with time during the day on Monday. Snow
is likely to begin around 4 AM PST Monday morning. Heavy snow
and blowing and drifting snow expected. Total new snow
accumulations of 8 to 15 inches for most of the area north of
Highway 140 and 3 to 7 inches south of Highway 140. Winds gusts
45 to 75 mph at times, especially over the higher terrain and in
areas open to winds from the south and southwest.
* WHERE...All areas, especially highways 97, 140, and 31.
* WHEN...From 4 PM Sunday to 4 AM PST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Snow is likely to begin around 4 AM PST Monday
morning. Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Patchy
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute. Very strong winds could cause extensive tree damage.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snowfall rates in excess of 1 inch per
hours are expected during the daylight hours of Monday along and
near Highway 97 from about Chiloquin to La Pine. This snow,
coupled with strong winds, is likely to result in poor
visibility conditions with whiteout/blizzard conditions, at
times, in that area.
