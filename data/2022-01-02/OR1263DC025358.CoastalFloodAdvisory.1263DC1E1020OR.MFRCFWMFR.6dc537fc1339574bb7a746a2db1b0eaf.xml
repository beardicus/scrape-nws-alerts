<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued January 02 at 12:22PM PST until January 03 at 6:00PM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM THIS AFTERNOON
TO 10 AM PST TUESDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM TO 6 PM PST
MONDAY...
* WHAT...Large breaking waves of 24 to 27 feet expected. High
water levels are expected around bays and estuaries with tidal
influence.
* WHERE...High surf and beach inundation is expected along the
south central Oregon coastline, but mainly along more south-
facing shorelines. Coastal flooding may impact shorelines and
waterfronts around tidal basins in Coos County, including North
Bend, Coos Bay, and the areas and roads adjacent to sloughs and
creeks, including Highways 42 and 101.
* WHEN...The High Surf Advisory is in effect from 4 PM Sunday to
10 AM PST Tuesday. The Coastal Flood Advisory is in effect from
6 AM through 6 PM Monday.
* IMPACTS...Large breaking waves will create hazardous conditions
along and within the surf zone, and could inundate beaches and
low lying shorelines. Beach erosion is possible. High water
levels along bays and shorelines could result in lane closure
or complete road closure. Low lying property and infrastructure
along area tidal basins, including railroads, could become
inundated.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...High water levels resulting from King
Tides, heavy rainfall, and storm force winds are expected to
surpass thresholds that have caused minor flooding and
road/lane closures in the past, particularly in the Coos Bay
area.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Stay away from the surf zone and off of jetties. Area beaches may
become hazardous due to dangerous surf conditions.</instruction>
