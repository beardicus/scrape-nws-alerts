<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY MORNING
THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...High astronomical tides may cause flooding in some low-
lying areas along Humboldt Bay and the northern Humboldt coast.
On Monday...strong southwest winds may result in enhanced wave
run up at area beaches, especially around 11 AM Monday morning
when high tide is forecast to peak at 8.73 feet, plus a half-
foot to a foot of tidal anomaly is possible.
* WHERE...Northern Humboldt Coast County.
* WHEN...From Monday morning through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and local low-lying roads
close to Humboldt Bay and the immediate coast, with only
isolated road closures expected. Jackson Ranch Road, King
Salmon, Centerville Beach, and other low-lying sections of Samoa
Peninsula will likely see flooding.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
