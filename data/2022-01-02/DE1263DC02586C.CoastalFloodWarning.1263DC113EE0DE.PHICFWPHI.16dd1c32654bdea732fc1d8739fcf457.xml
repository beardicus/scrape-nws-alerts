<instruction>A Coastal Flood Warning means that moderate or major tidal
flooding is occurring or imminent. Be prepared for rising water
levels and take appropriate action to protect life and property.
Follow the recommendations of local emergency management
officials.
Do not drive your vehicle through flood waters. The water may be
deeper than you think it is. You will be putting yourself in
danger and your vehicle may be damaged, leading to costly repairs.
Visit the Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service at
water.weather.gov/ahps for additional water level and flood impact
information for your local tide gauge.</instruction>
