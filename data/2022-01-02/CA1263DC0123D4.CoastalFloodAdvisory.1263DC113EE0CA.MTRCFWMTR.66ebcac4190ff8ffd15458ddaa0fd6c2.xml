<description>...KING TIDES WILL CAUSE MINOR COASTAL FLOODING AT LOW LYING
SPOTS DURING HIGH TIDE THROUGH MONDAY...
.The highest astronomical tides of the year, commonly referred to
as the King Tides, will again impact the coast and bayshore
tonight through Monday. King Tides occur when tidal forces
maximize as the moon, earth, and sun come into alignment while
the moon is in perigee (nearest to the earth) and the earth is at
perihelion (nearest to the sun). These tides will peak during the
mid to late morning and have historically resulted in the
localized flooding of specific low lying areas each year. In
addition, the lowest low tides of the season will follow hours
later in the afternoons that may lead to trouble for mariners
navigating shallow waterways. The King Tides tidal readings are
expected to peak Sunday.
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST
MONDAY...
* WHAT...Minor coastal flooding expected at prone low lying
coastal locations across the San Francisco Bay shoreline
during peak high tide through Monday.
* WHERE...Low lying portions of the San Francisco Bayshore.
Localized impacts are also possible in low lying areas along
the Pacific shore as well, such as near Elkhorn Slough.
* WHEN...Until 10 AM PST Monday. The highest high tides are
expected to occur during mid to late morning while the lowest
low tides will occur during mid afternoon to early evening.
Please refer to local tidal data forecasts available for several
coastal and bayshore locations at
www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of areas previously impacted by King Tide
events is expected, including low lying lots, parks, and roads
throughout the San Francisco Bay Shoreline with the highest
high tides. Difficulty navigating shallow bay waters during
the lowest low tides.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Tidal levels will also rise along the
Pacific coast but impacts will be more localized to areas such
as Elkhorn Slough near Moss Landing. Tide poolers and
beachgoers should be familiar with the times and heights of
local tidal levels to avoid hazards that may arise from
rapidly shifting water levels.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
