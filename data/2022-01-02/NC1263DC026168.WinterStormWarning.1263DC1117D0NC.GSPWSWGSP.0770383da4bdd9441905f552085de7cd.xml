TO NOON EST MONDAY...

inches along the northern parts and higher terrain. Winds
gusting as high as 50 mph at times.
* WHERE...Buncombe County.
* WHEN...From 10 PM this evening to noon EST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning commute. The winds may blow
down tree limbs and produce scattered power outages.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Rain is expected to change over to snow at
high elevations late this evening, and then down to the valleys
overnight. A few pockets of brief freezing rain or sleet are
possible during the transition, but all the precipitation should
change to snow quickly overnight. Although the ground is
relatively warm because of the recent warm temperatures, the

many roadways. The snow should taper off from the west Monday
morning. Slippery roads and black ice conditions could persist
or redevelop well into Tuesday morning.</description>
