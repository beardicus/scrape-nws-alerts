<headline>Coastal Flood Watch issued January 02 at 4:41AM PST until January 03 at 5:00PM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM THIS AFTERNOON
TO 10 AM PST TUESDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY MORNING
THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Large breaking waves of 22 to 25 feet expected. High
water levels around bays and estuaries are possible.
* WHERE...High surf is expected along the south central Oregon
coastline, but mainly along more south-facing shorelines.
Coastal flooding may impact shorelines and waterfronts around
tidal basins in Coos County, including North Bend, Coos Bay,
and the areas and roads adjacent to sloughs and creeks,
including Highways 42 and 101.
* WHEN...The High Surf Advisory is in effect from 4 PM Sunday to
10 AM PST Tuesday. The Coastal Flood Watch is in effect from
Monday morning through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Large breaking waves will create hazardous
conditions along and within the surf zone, and could inundate
beaches and low lying shorelines. Beach erosion is possible.
High water levels along bays and shorelines may result in lane
closure or complete road closure. Low lying property and
infrastructure along area tidal basins, including railroads,
could become inundated.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...High water levels resulting from King
Tides, heavy rainfall, and storm force winds are expected to
surpass thresholds that have caused minor flooding and
road/lane closures in the past, particularly in the Coos Bay
area.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Stay away from the surf zone and off of jetties. Area beaches may
become hazardous due to dangerous surf conditions.</instruction>
