<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 02 at 4:23AM EST until January 03 at 12:00PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 10 PM THIS EVENING TO NOON
EST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 2 to 3
inches across Asheville and vicinity, with amounts up to 5
inches at the highest elevations. Winds gusting as high as 40
mph.
* WHERE...Buncombe County.
* WHEN...From 10 PM this evening to noon EST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Rain is expected to change over to snow at
high elevations late this evening, and then down to the valleys
after midnight. A few pockets of brief freezing rain are
possible during the transition, but all the precipitation should
change to snow by the early morning hours. Although the ground
is relatively warm because of the recent warm temperatures, the
snow is expected to fall hard enough to accumulate even on
roads. The snow may linger into the middle part of the morning
along the Tennessee border, but slippery roads may persist
through the remainder of the morning hours, with temperatures
below freezing through noon.</description>

conditions are expected or occurring. Significant amounts of snow
are forecast that will make travel dangerous. Only travel in an
emergency. If you must travel, keep a flashlight, food, water,
and a warm blanket in your vehicle in case of an emergency.
