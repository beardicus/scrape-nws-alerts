<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued April 14 at 3:13PM PDT until April 14 at 11:00PM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM PDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Snow expected. West of Highway 89, additional
accumulations of up to 6 inches along the crest with 2-4 inches
below 7000 feet. East of Highway 89 may see up to an additional
inch of snow. Rain/snow mix for Tahoe lake level will continue.
Winds gusting in excess of 50 mph in the upper portions of the
Sierra.
* WHERE...Greater Lake Tahoe Area.
* WHEN...Until 11 PM PDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commutes. Area
roadways that are wet as of nightfall may freeze overnight,
creating slick conditions. Strong winds could cause tree
damage.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The highest totals will be for the Sierra
crest and western portion of the Tahoe Basin, with much less
snow on the eastern side of the Basin. Gusty winds will bring
rough lake waters to Lake Tahoe with wave heights of 1 to 3
feet.</description>
<instruction>Even light snowfall causes major travel delays, especially during
periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to
reach your destination. Leave extra space between vehicles since
it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
