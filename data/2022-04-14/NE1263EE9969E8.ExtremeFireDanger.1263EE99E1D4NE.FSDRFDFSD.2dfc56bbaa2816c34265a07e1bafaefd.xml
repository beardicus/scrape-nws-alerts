<description>.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 355 AM CDT Thu Apr 14 2022
Dry antecedent conditions continue to provide dry fuels for fires
today. Relative humidity`s fall to the 20s and possibly teens if
efficient mixing can occur this afternoon along with strong
westerly winds gusting above 45 mph all but make for critical fire
danger conditions. Have issued a red flag warning from a line
from Corsica, SD to Harrisburg SD, to Spencer, IA and south. The
red flag warning is in effect from noon to 9 pm this evening.
Tomorrow is a bit questionable for fire danger concerns. While
relative humidity`s will again be in the low 20s, winds may be too
light to issue any red flag warnings. Will monitor trends to see if
fire weather headlines will be needed for Friday.
Consider postponing burning due to the very high or extreme fire
danger.
...EXTREME FIRE DANGER...
The Grassland Fire Danger Index will reach the extreme category
this afternoon. Extreme weather conditions and very low
moisture content of grasses, and other dry organic material
on the ground, indicate that critical burning conditions exist.
All fires have the potential to become large and spread quickly,
becoming erratic with extreme behavioral characteristics.
No outdoor burning should take place.
OUTLOOK FOR FRIDAY AFTERNOON...The Grassland Fire Danger Index
will reach the high category.
The grassland fire danger product reflects fire danger for native
grasses. It is not intended for cured agricultural crops, nor
will it reflect conditions in road ditches which have been mowed.</description>
