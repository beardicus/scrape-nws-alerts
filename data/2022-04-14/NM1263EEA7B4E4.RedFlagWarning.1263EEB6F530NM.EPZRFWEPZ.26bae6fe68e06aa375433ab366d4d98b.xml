<description>...FIRE WEATHER CONCERNS FOR FRIDAY DUE TO EXTREMELY LOW HUMIDITY
AND GUSTY WINDS...
.Extremely low humidity within a settled airmass will remain in
the area through Friday. Friday morning west winds above 3000ft
will become breezy, with the rest of the lower elevations
becoming breezy Friday afternoon. These lower elevations
encompass the Rio Grande Valley and eastward. West winds in the
higher elevations, including the Sacramento Mountains, will
strengthen to marginally gusty in the afternoon hours. Even though
wind speeds will be marginal, very low humidities on top of an
extremely windy day earlier this week have dried fuels out. Winds
will slowly diminish Friday night.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM TO 9 PM MDT
FRIDAY FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONES 112 AND 113...
* AFFECTED AREA...Fire weather zones 112 and 113.
* WIND...Lowlands 15 to 20 mph with gusts up to 25 mph,
Mountain areas will see 15 - 25mph with gusts up to 30 mph.
* HUMIDITY...2 to 8%. Overnight RH recoveries are forecasted to
remain under 20%.
* IMPACTS...any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly.
Outdoor burning is not recommended. Be careful with anything
cause sparks.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now, or will shortly. A combination of
strong winds, low relative humidity, and warm temperatures can
contribute to extreme fire behavior.</instruction>
