<description>...Sneaker Wave Risk at Area Beaches this Weekend...
.A very long period northwest swell originating from a storm
system near the Aleutians will arrive along the coastline this
weekend. This very long period northwest swell will create a high
risk of sneaker waves at area beaches. Sneaker wave risk rises
substantially today as swell heights build while wave periods of
17 to 21 are expected. In addition, stronger than usual rip
currents should be expected.
On days with high sneaker wave risk, the ocean can appear
deceptively calm with long lulls between larger wave sets. This
may lead to individuals venturing onto exposed coastal features
where infrequent but powerful waves can overwhelm them, knocking
them into the cold, restless ocean where the possibility of
hypothermia or drowning is severe. Each year, individuals lose
their life during similar sneaker wave events along the
California coast. If visiting the coast this weekend, respect the
power of the ocean, remain vigilant of your surroundings, and
avoiding venturing onto exposed coastal features where sudden,
powerful waves can put your life at risk.
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Long period northwest swell at 17 to 23 seconds.
* WHERE...Entire coastline from Sonoma county to Monterey
county, including the San Francisco Peninsula Pacific
shoreline.
* WHEN...Today through Sunday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...High risk of sneaker waves and strong rip currents.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Initial forerunner waves arrive late
today with periods in excess of 23 seconds. The highest risk
of sneaker waves expect on Saturday and into Sunday morning
when wave heights of 3 to 6 feet and periods of 17 to 21
seconds are expected. The risk of sneaker wave decreases by
Sunday afternoon as wave heights increase enough for the ocean
to provide its own natural warning.</description>
