<headline>Flood Watch issued February 26 at 10:57AM EST  by NWS Grand Rapids</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues to be possible.
* WHERE...A portion of southwest Michigan, including the following
county, Ottawa.
* WHEN...Through Sunday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Localized flooding of low lying areas and property along
the Grand River will be possible. Rapid water level fluctuations
may occur due to heavy ice cover on the river and possible ice jam
formation.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Water levels remain high across the area, and therefore ice
jams are still possible. The threat of ice jams will begin to
diminish once the river starts falling. That is expected to
happen by later Sunday.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
