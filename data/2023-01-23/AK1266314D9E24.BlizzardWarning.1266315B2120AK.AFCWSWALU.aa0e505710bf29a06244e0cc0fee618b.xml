<headline>Blizzard Warning issued January 23 at 4:45AM AKST until January 23 at 5:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM AKST THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions occurring. Northeast winds 35 to 40
mph gusting as high as 50 mph. Visibility reduced to one quarter
mile at times. Wind chills as low as 30F to 50F below zero.
* WHERE...Kuskokwim Delta coast.
* WHEN...Until 5 PM AKST this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Areas of blowing snow could significantly reduce
visibility. The dangerously cold wind chills as low as 50
below zero could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little
as 10 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The worst conditions are occurring along
the coast. Winds will very slowly diminish throughout the day,
which may allow for gradually improving conditions, with
intermittent breaks of higher visibility. Visibilities as low as
one half mile are still possible at inland locations within the
Kuskokwim Delta, including Bethel. Blowing snow will continue to
reduce visibility as low as one half mile across the Kuskokwim
Delta through Monday evening while 25 to 35 mph northeasterly
winds persist. Conditions will begin to improve more
substantially tonight as winds start to diminish more quickly.</description>
<instruction>A Blizzard Warning means severe winter weather conditions are
expected or occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds
and poor visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout
conditions, making travel very hazardous. If you must travel,
have a winter survival kit with you.If you get stranded, stay
with your vehicle.</instruction>
