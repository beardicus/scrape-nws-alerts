<description>...WIDESPREAD MODERATE TO HEAVY SNOWFALL THROUGH MONDAY...
.Low pressure will cross the Gulf of Maine today, continuing and in
some cases increasing snowfall over the region. Although there will
be somewhat of a lull during the first part of the day as the storm
undergoes a bit of a transition entering the Gulf of Maine, the
storm will strongly amplify and renew heavy snowfall over the warned
area through today. Snowfall rates exceeding an inch per hour will
be possible as banded snowfall organizes and translates across the
forecast area by this afternoon and through the evening, bringing
significant travel impacts for the entire day, particularly through
the I-95 corridor and into the urbanized areas of southern New
Hampshire during the evening commute. Snow will end from west to
east through the evening hours as the system pulls away from New
England. Gusty northwest winds of 25 to 35 mph will also be in play
today and tonight, which may lead to a few power outages where wet
and sticky snow from this morning clings to trees and power outages.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Snow. Additional snow accumulations between 2 and 4 inches
for a storm total of 3 to 8 inches. North to northwest winds
gusting as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...In Maine, Northern Franklin and Northern Oxford Counties.
In New Hampshire, Northern Coos, Northern Grafton, and Southern
Coos Counties.
* WHEN...Until 7 PM EST this evening.
* IMPACTS...An area of low pressure will bring a period of snowfall
to the region. Travel will be impacted due to snowfall
accumulations on roads. Periods of moderate to locally heavy snow
will combine with low visibility to create dangerous driving
conditions. The hazardous conditions will  impact the Monday
morning and evening commutes.</description>
