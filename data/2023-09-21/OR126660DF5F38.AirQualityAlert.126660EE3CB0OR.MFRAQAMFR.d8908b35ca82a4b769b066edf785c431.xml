<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON PDT FRIDAY...
Oregon Department of Environmental Quality has continued an Air
Pollution Advisory...in effect until at least Friday morning
Wildfires burning in the region combined with forecast conditions
will cause air quality levels to fluctuate and could be at unhealthy
levels.
The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality issued an air quality
advisory for northern Curry County, including Gold Beach, due to
smoke from the Anvil fires. DEQ also expects other areas of the state
may see intermittent smoke from ongoing large wildfires.
Smoke levels can change rapidly depending on weather. Smoke can
irritate the eyes and lungs and worsen some medical conditions.
People most at risk include infants and young children, people with
heart or lung disease, older adults and pregnant people.
Keep windows and doors closed. If itâ€™s too hot, run air conditioning
on recirculate or consider moving to a cooler location. Avoid
strenuous outdoor activity. Use high- efficiency particulate air
(HEPA) filters in indoor ventilation systems or portable air
purifiers. Be aware of smoke in your area and avoid places with the
highest levels. When air quality improves to moderate or healthy,
open windows and doors to air out homes and businesses. If you have a
breathing plan for a medical condition, be sure to follow it and
keep any needed medications refilled.
