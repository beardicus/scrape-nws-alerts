UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for wind 39
to 57 mph
- The wind threat has remained nearly steady from the
previous assessment.
- PLAN: Plan for hazardous wind of equivalent tropical storm
force.
- PREPARE: Efforts to protect property should now be
underway. Prepare for limited wind damage.
- ACT: Act now to complete preparations before the wind
becomes hazardous.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, especially if soils are saturated. Some roadway
signs will sustain damage.

driving conditions on bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* STORM SURGE
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible
- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 2-4 feet
above ground somewhere within surge prone areas
- Window of concern: Friday evening until early Sunday morning
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm
surge flooding greater than 3 feet above ground
- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the
previous assessment.
- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of
greater than 3 feet above ground.
- PREPARE: Evacuation efforts and flood preparations should
soon be brought to completion before conditions become
unsafe.
- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for
your area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or
needlessly risk lives.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant
- Severe storm surge flooding will likely cause inundation of
numerous roads and buildings, resulting in a threat to life
and property. Flooding will likely extend inland from the
waterfront and shoreline flooding homes, businesses and
isolating some neighborhoods. Large breaking waves will
result in additional damage near the shoreline.
- Numerous roads flooded or washed out.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching some dunes.
- Severe damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers is
expected. Small craft broken away from moorings, especially
in unprotected marinas and docks.

action may result in serious injury or loss of life.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant
- Flooding from heavy rainfall may prompt evacuations and
rescues
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen, with
swift currents, and overspill their banks. Small streams,
creeks, and ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures and/or weaken
foundations. Some areas may experience areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor
drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on
moving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.
Driving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge
closures are expected.
