<headline>Hydrologic Outlook issued September 21 at 7:55PM PDT  by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...Flood Potential Outlook for flash flooding on area burn scars in
the following counties: In California, western Siskiyou County. In
Oregon, Curry, Douglas, and southwest Josephine counties. This
includes the Tyee Complex, Anvil, Flat, Chilcoot, Smith River
Complex (in Oregon), and Happy Camp Complex fires.
An atmospheric river will produce periods of moderate rainfall for
southern Oregon and northern California. While this rainfall will be
mostly beneficial, especially for ongoing fires, there is a risk
that rainfall rates could be high enough to produce debris flows for
some burn scars.
A flood potential outlook is issued when there is the potential for
flooding along burn scars, rivers, and streams. The exact scenario
for flooding remains uncertain. This product will be updated as
necessary. Watches and warnings may be issued by the National
Weather Service if this situation worsens.</description>
