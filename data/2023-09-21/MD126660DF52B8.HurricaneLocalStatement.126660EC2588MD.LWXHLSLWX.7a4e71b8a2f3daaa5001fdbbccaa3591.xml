Night Through Early Sunday**
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning has been issued for Calvert and St.
Marys
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Calvert and St. Marys
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 670 miles south of Washington DC or about 680 miles south
of Annapolis MD
- 29.2N 75.9W
- Storm Intensity 35 mph
- Movement North or 360 degrees at 8 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen will move northward toward
the Mid-Atlantic Coast through Friday before moving northward near
the Mid-Atlantic Coast Saturday through Sunday.
The main threat will be a storm surge with inundation around 2 to 3
feet most likely for locations along the western shore of the
Chesapeake Bay as well as the shore of the Tidal Potomac River. The
highest water levels will be around times of high tide Saturday
through Saturday night.
Rainfall will most likely average between 1 to 3 inches with
localized amounts around 3 to 5 inches possible. The best chance for
the highest rainfall amounts will be near and east of Interstate 95.
This may result in isolated instances of flooding, especially for
low lying and flood prone areas. The heaviest rain is most likely to
occur Saturday into Saturday night.
Tropical Storm force winds are most likely over southern Maryland
and the nearby waters south of North Beach along the Chesapeake Bay
and south of Cobb Island along the Tidal Potomac River. However,
gale-force winds are expected along the waters father north along
the Chesapeake Bay as well as the Tidal Potomac River. Gusty winds
and a saturated ground may cause downed trees and power outages.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time
across Eastern West Virginia, Central and Western Maryland, Northern
and Northwestern Virginia, and District of Columbia.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Isolated instances of flooding are possible due to locally heavy rainfall.
The best chance for flooding will be in low lying flood prone areas.
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across,
mainly across southern Maryland. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across Eastern West Virginia, Central and Western Maryland,
Northern and Northwestern Virginia, and District of Columbia, little
to no impact is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
