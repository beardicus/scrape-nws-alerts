SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Potential Tropical Cyclone 16, currently east of the Florida
peninsula, could strengthen as it moves toward eastern North Carolina
over the next few days. Regardless of development, impacts will occur
across eastern North Carolina, with greatest impacts along the coast.
Life threatening storm surge is possible across all coastal areas
later Friday into the weekend. The most extensive impacts are expected
to be along the lower Pamlico and Neuse Rivers, with at least minor
overwash also possible along the Outer Banks.
Tropical storm force winds could start impacting portions of eastern
North Carolina by early Friday morning with strong winds continuing
through Saturday, potentially bringing scattered tree damage and power
outages mainly along and east of Hwy 17.
Heavy rain bands could produce flash flooding of low lying areas with
localized rainfall amounts near 6 inches expected near the coast.
Isolated tornadoes could produce locally significant damage mainly
across the Inner and Outer Banks and Down East Carteret County.
Dangerous marine conditions are also expected with very dangerous surf
conditions along the beaches.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Protect against life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across all of coastal eastern North Carolina north of Surf City.
Potential impacts in this area include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
* WIND:
Protect against dangerous wind having possible significant impacts
across the Outer Banks and Down East Carteret County. Potential impacts
in this area include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
Also, protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts
along and east of US Hwy 17.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible
significant impacts across Eastern North Carolina. Potential impacts
include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals, and
ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts
across the Outer and Inner Banks and Down East Carteret County.
Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
Elsewhere across Eastern North Carolina, little to no impact is
anticipated.
* OTHER COASTAL HAZARDS:
Very dangerous marine conditions will occur across all area waters beginning
Friday. Life threatening rip currents and surf conditions will also continue
through the weekend.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions, including
possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so immediately.
For those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind, falling
trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move, relocate to
a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help keep roadways open
for those under evacuation orders.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
Keep cell phones well charged. Cell phone chargers for automobiles
can be helpful, but be aware of your risk for deadly carbon monoxide
poisoning if your car is left idling in a garage or other poorly
ventilated area.
If you are a visitor, be sure to know the name of the city or town in
which you are staying and the name of the county or parish in which
it resides. Listen for these locations in local news updates. Pay
attention for instructions from local authorities.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
