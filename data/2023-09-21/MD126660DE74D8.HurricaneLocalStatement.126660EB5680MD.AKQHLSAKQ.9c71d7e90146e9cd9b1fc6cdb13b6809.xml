SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
At 1100 AM EDT, Potential Tropical Cyclone 16 was centered near
latitude 28.7 North, longitude 75.9 West. The system is moving toward
the north near 9 mph, and this general motion is expected to continue
through early Friday. A north-northwestward to northward motion is
forecast by late Friday and continue into the weekend. The center of
the cyclone is expected to approach the coast of North Carolina within
the warning area Friday night and early Saturday.
Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect for locations along and near the
coastlines of the Atlantic Ocean from Duck, NC to Fenwick Island, DE,
the Chesapeake Bay from Cape Henry to Smith Point, the tidal rivers of
eastern Virginia, and the Currituck and Albemarle Sounds of NC. A Storm
Surge Watch is in effect for the Atlantic coast from Duck, NC to
Chincoteague, VA, the Chesapeake Bay from Cape Henry to Smith Point and
the tidal rivers of eastern VA, and along the Albemarle and Currituck
Sounds in NC. Tropical Storm force wind is expected to arrive Friday
night into early Saturday and this could lead to downed trees and
scattered power outages. Areas of moderate to major coastal flooding
are possible during high tide Friday night into Saturday.
Heavy rainfall is expected to accompany the cyclone with 2-3 inches
possible inland, and 3-4 inches closer to the coast. There is a limited
threat of tornadoes along the coast of northeast NC.
Dangerous marine conditions are expected Friday night into Saturday
due to the strong winds and high seas. Seas build to 10 to 15 feet
Friday night into Saturday and remain elevated into Sunday.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
Northeast North Carolina, Eastern Virginia, and Southeast Maryland.
Potential impacts in this area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, especially if soils are saturated. Some roadway signs
will sustain damage.
- A few roads will be impassable from debris. Hazardous driving
conditions on bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across CENTRAL AND EASTERN VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST NORTH
CAROLINA...AND THE LOWER MARYLAND EASTERN SHORE, little to no impact
is anticipated.
* SURGE:
Protect against life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across Northeast North Carolina and Eastern Virginia.
Potential impacts in this area include:
- Severe storm surge flooding will likely cause inundation of
numerous roads and buildings, resulting in a threat to life and
property. Flooding will likely extend inland from the
waterfront and shoreline flooding homes, businesses and
isolating some neighborhoods. Large breaking waves will result
in additional damage near the shoreline.
- Numerous roads flooded or washed out.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching some dunes.
- Severe damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers is
expected. Small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected marinas and docks.
Also, protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across Southeast Maryland.
Elsewhere across CENTRAL AND EASTERN VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST NORTH
CAROLINA...AND THE LOWER MARYLAND EASTERN SHORE, little to no impact
is anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible
significant impacts across Northeast North Carolina, Eastern Virginia,
and Southeast Maryland. Potential impacts include:
- Flooding from heavy rainfall may prompt evacuations and rescues
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen, with swift
currents, and overspill their banks. Small streams, creeks, and
ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures and/or weaken
foundations. Some areas may experience areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures are expected.
Protect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across the eastern Virginia Piedmont.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
coastal Northeast North Carolina. Potential impacts include:
- A few tornadoes are expected. As a result, execution of
emergency plans could be hindered in affected areas.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Roofs peeled off some buildings. A few chimneys toppled and
mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned. Large tree
tops and branches snapped off, with some trees knocked over. A
few vehicles blown off roads.
Elsewhere across CENTRAL AND EASTERN VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST NORTH
CAROLINA...AND THE LOWER MARYLAND EASTERN SHORE, little to no impact
is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local officials for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
Keep cell phones well charged. Cell phone chargers for automobiles
can be helpful, but be aware of your risk for deadly carbon monoxide
poisoning if your car is left idling in a garage or other poorly
ventilated area.
If you are a visitor, be sure to know the name of the city or town in
which you are staying and the name of the county or parish in which
it resides. Listen for these locations in local news updates. Pay
attention for instructions from local authorities.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
