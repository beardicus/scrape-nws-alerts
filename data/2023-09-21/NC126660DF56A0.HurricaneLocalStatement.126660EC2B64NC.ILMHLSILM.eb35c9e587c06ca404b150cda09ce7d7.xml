SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen will move over the coastal
waters passing just offshore of southeast North Carolina Friday into
Saturday. The primary impacts are likely to be hazardous marine and
surf conditions along the entire coast of northeast South Carolina and
southeast North Carolina. Tropical storm force winds and heavy
rainfall are also expected over portions of southeast North Carolina,
especially north and east of Wilmington. Minor coastal flooding is
also possible north of Cape Fear, especially at high tide Friday and
Friday night.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible
significant impacts across southeast North Carolina and far northeast
South Carolina. Potential impacts include:
- Moderate flooding from rainfall may prompt some evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and streams may rise and overspill their banks in a few
places, especially in the typical prone locations. Small creeks
and ditches may overflow.
- Flood waters may enter some structures. Underpasses, low-lying
spots along roadways, and poor drainage areas may become
submerged by rising water. Some secondary streets and parking
lots may flood as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.
- Driving conditions will become hazardous, and some road
closures can be expected.
Protect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across inland southeast North Carolina and portions of
northeast South Carolina.
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
southeast North Carolina. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Unsecured lightweight objects may be blown about.
- Some large limbs may break from trees. A few shallow rooted or
weak trees may snap or be knocked down.
- Scattered power and communications outages are possible.
Elsewhere across southeast North Carolina and northeast South
Carolina, little to no impact is anticipated.
* SURGE:
Protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across coastal southeast North Carolina, mainly north of
Cape Fear. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Localized inundation and minor over-wash is possible, mainly
along immediate shorelines and other vulnerable low-lying areas
along the coast. Low spots along waterways and tidal creeks may
also be impacted.
- Navigation may be difficult near inlets and waterways, as
navigational aids may be off station or missing.
- Minor beach erosion possible.
Elsewhere across southeast North Carolina and northeast South
Carolina, little to no impact is anticipated.
* OTHER COASTAL HAZARDS:
Hazardous surf conditions are expected through Saturday, including rip currents.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to bring to completion all preparations to protect
life and property in accordance with your emergency plan.
Outside preparations should be wrapped up as soon as possible before
weather conditions completely deteriorate. Any remaining evacuations
and relocations should be expedited before the onset of tropical
storm force wind.
Keep cell phones well charged and handy. Also, cell phone chargers
for automobiles can be helpful after the storm. Locate your chargers
and keep them with your cell phone.
Closely monitor NOAA Weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes to
the forecast.
