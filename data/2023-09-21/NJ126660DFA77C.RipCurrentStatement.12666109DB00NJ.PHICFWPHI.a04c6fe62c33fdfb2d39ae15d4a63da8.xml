<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
For the Coastal Flood Watch, one to two feet of inundation
above ground level possible in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...Atlantic Coastal Cape May and Coastal Atlantic.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Saturday
evening. For the Coastal Flood Watch, from Saturday afternoon
through Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...At this level, widespread roadway flooding occurs in
coastal and bayside communities and along inland tidal
waterways. Many roads become impassable. Some damage to
vulnerable structures may begin to occur. Rip currents can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...With the long duration of onshore winds
expected, the back bays may struggle to drain during low
tides. This could result in minor to moderate coastal flooding
lingering after high tide. Additionally, minor flooding is
possible again with the Sunday afternoon high tide.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
