<description>...WARM-UP CONTINUES ACROSS THE MATANUSKA VALLEY, ANCHORAGE, AND
THE WESTERN KENAI PENINSULA...
Temperatures have warmed to near or above freezing for much of
the region from the Kenai Peninsula northward to Anchorage and the
Matanuska Valley. Localized gusty winds coming across the Kenai
and Chugach Mountains will lead to additional warming today, with
the entire region expected to rise above freezing.
Another round of light rain is expected today, crossing the Kenai
Peninsula mid to late morning, then the Anchorage and Matanuska
Valley midday to early afternoon. Rainfall will be light and brief
in any one location. In fact, some areas may remain dry or just
see a few sprinkles. Still, any rain that does fall onto cold
roadways will likely lead to icy conditions.
A larger storm will cross the Gulf of Alaska today and head inland
across Prince William Sound sometime late tonight or Wednesday
morning. This has potential to bring heavier precipitation and
cause more significant impacts to travel along area roadways. The
exact track of this storm remains uncertain, making it difficult
to nail down precipitation amounts and precipitation type. Most
likely, precipitation would start as rain tonight and possibly
transition to snow by Wednesday morning. Stay tuned to the latest
forecasts by visiting weather.gov/afc.</description>
