<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 24 at 3:21AM EST until January 26 at 1:00PM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...HEAVY SNOW AND MIXED PRECIP LATE WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
THURSDAY...
.Low pressure brings a round of moderate to heavy snow late
Wednesday afternoon and evening. Snow changes to mixed precipitation
Wednesday night from south to north, with light ice accretion
possible across interior areas. The precipitation likely ends as
rain along the coastline Thursday morning, with snow or mix possible
into the afternoon hours across northern areas.
...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Heavy snow and mixed precipitation possible. Total snow
accumulations greater than 6 inches and ice accumulations up to
one tenth of an inch possible. Winds could gust as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of southwest Maine. Portions of central and
southern New Hampshire.
* WHEN...From Wednesday afternoon through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will
likely become slick and hazardous. With snow already on branches
in many locations, the strong winds and additional weight of snow
on tree limbs may down power lines and could cause sporadic power
outages. Snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour are possible
Wednesday evening. Periods of moderate and heavy snow will combine
with low visibility to create dangerous driving conditions. Ice
may accumulate and cause slippery conditions on untreated
surfaces. The hazardous conditions could impact the Wednesday
evening and Thursday morning commutes.</description>
