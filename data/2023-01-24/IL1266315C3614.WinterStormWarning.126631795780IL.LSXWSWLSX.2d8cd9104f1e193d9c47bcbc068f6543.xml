<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 24 at 3:09AM CST until January 25 at 6:00PM CST by NWS Saint Louis</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM THIS EVENING TO 6 PM CST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 4 and
6 inches.
* WHERE...Jersey IL County.
* WHEN...From 6 PM this evening to 6 PM CST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will
likely become slick and hazardous. Plan on slippery road
conditions. The hazardous conditions could impact the Tuesday
evening and Wednesday morning commutes.</description>
<instruction>The rapid accumulation of snow will make travel extremely difficult,
if not impossible. If travel is necessary, be sure to exercise
extreme caution. If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food
and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road
conditions can be obtained at www.gettingaroundillinois.com.
Persons should consider delaying all travel. Motorists should use
extreme caution if travel is absolutely necessary.
Those planning travel should be advised that visibilities will vary
greatly across the area, and weather conditions in rural areas will
be much worse than those in a nearby town or city. Do not be fooled,
if you are planning travel in an open area, make certain you and
your car are prepared for the elements. Although treated roads may
just be wet, untreated surfaces will be ice covered and very
slippery. Motorists should remain alert for rapid changes in road
conditions, especially when turning onto lesser travelled roads,
side streets, or parking lots.</instruction>
