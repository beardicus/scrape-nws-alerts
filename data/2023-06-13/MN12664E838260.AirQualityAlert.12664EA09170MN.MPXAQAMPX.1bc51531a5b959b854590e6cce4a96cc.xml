<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM CDT WEDNESDAY THROUGH
6 AM CDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has issued an Air
Quality Alert for fine particle pollution. The Air Quality Index
(AQI) is expected to reach the Orange or Unhealthy for Sensitive
Groups category.
* WHERE...Douglas, Pope, and Stevens counties in central
Minnesota.
* WHEN...From 6 PM CDT Wednesday through 6 AM CDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease
(including asthma), heart disease, children and older adults, and
people who are active outdoors, may experience health effects.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Wildfire smoke from Ontario will move into
central Minnesota Wednesday afternoon. The concentrations of
fine particle pollution from the wildfire smoke will be
sufficient to reduce air quality to the Orange (Unhealthy for
Sensitive Groups) category.

<instruction>Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including
asthma), heart disease, children and older adults, and people who
are active outdoors, should limit prolonged or heavy outdoor
exertion.
Reduce or eliminate activities that contribute to air pollution,
such as outdoor burning, and use of residential wood burning
devices. Reduce vehicle trips and vehicle idling as much as
possible.
Keep windows closed overnight to prevent smoke from getting
indoors.</instruction>
