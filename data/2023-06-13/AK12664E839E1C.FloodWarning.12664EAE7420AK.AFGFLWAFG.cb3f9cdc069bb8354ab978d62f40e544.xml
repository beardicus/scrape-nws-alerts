<headline>Flood Warning issued June 13 at 1:27PM AKDT  by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AKDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding is occurring.
* WHERE...Sagavanirktok River near Dalton Highway from Mileposts 401
to 407.
* WHEN...Until 600 PM AKDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Flood waters are eroding the Dalton Highway between
Milepost 401 and 407, with the road down to one lane. If
conditions worsen, the road may wash out and become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 130 PM AKDT Tuesday,the Sagavanirktok River continues to
flow overbank due to remnant ice in the main channel. This is
forcing the water to flow west and cause erosion along the
Dalton Highway from Milepost 401 to 407. These conditions are
expected to persist until ice in the main channel clears.
- Rain falling in the headwaters of the Sagavanirktok River is
expected through early Wednesday. This will result in rising
water levels on the Sagavanirktok River through Thursday. The
river is expected to crest near Pump Station 3 early
Wednesday morning and at the coast on Thursday.
