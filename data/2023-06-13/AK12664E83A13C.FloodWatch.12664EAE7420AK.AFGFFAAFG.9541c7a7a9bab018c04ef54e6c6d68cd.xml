<headline>Flood Watch issued June 13 at 1:35PM AKDT  by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH WEDNESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Rivers draining the Brooks Range east of the Dalton
Highway.
* WHEN...Through Wednesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff from rainfall may result in minor
flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and
flood-prone locations. Water will cover gravel bars, increased
debris will be coming downriver, and erosion is likely along some
riverbanks.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Between 1 to 1.5 inches of rain is expected between Monday
afternoon through Wednesday across the Brooks Range east of
the Dalton Highway to the Alcan border. Some locations may
see higher amounts. Runoff from this rainfall may cause
streams and rivers to rise rapidly to bankfull and possibly
overbank. This includes the Chandalar, Sheenjek, and Colleen
Rivers and their tributaries.
