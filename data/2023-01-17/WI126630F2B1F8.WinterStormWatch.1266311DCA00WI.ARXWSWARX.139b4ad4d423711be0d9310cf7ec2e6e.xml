<description>...Increasing Likelihood For Snow, Possibly Heavy, Wednesday Night
Into Thursday...
.A winter storm will move through the region later Wednesday
afternoon through Thursday bringing snowfall...possibly heavy for
some. There is still potential for a heavy snow band with greatest
accumulations near and north of Interstate 90. Warmer air could
cause a rain-snow mix in southwest Wisconsin and lesser snow
totals. There may also be some potential for freezing drizzle to
mix in at times.
There will likely be changes to the storm track and snow amounts
as the storm nears. Stay weather aware heading into Wednesday and
Thursday if you are traveling.
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT
THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 4 to 6
inches with locally higher amounts possible.
* WHERE...Taylor and Clark Counties.
* WHEN...From late Wednesday night through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous
conditions could impact the Thursday morning commute.</description>
