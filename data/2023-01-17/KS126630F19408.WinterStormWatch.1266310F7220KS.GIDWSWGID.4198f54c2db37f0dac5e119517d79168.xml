<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 17 at 4:26AM CST until January 19 at 12:00AM CST by NWS Hastings</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH
WEDNESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation possible. Significant variation
in snow amounts, ranging from as much as 4 to 7 inches in York,
Clay, and Harlan Counties in Nebraska, to as little as 1 to 3
inches in north central Kansas. Where snow amounts will be
lower, freezing rain could produce ice accumulation up to around
one quarter of an inch, especially southeast of a line from
Geneva to Franklin. Winds will average 15 to 20 MPH with gusts
to around 25 to 30 MPH, initially out of the northeast but then
turning northwesterly Wednesday night.
* WHERE...Phillips and Smith Counties in Kansas. York, Clay,
Fillmore, Harlan, Franklin, Webster, and Nuckolls Counties in
Nebraska.
* WHEN...From late Tuesday night through Wednesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous
conditions may develop in time to impact the Wednesday morning
commute, but there is greater confidence in impacts to the
Wednesday evening commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Please expect at least minor adjustments to
later snowfall forecasts, as confidence levels in snow amounts
at any given location is currently considered only medium. This
is due to continued uncertainty in the exact storm track, and
the location of a likely sharp transition from heavy snow to
wintry mix with this Winter Storm Watch area.</description>
