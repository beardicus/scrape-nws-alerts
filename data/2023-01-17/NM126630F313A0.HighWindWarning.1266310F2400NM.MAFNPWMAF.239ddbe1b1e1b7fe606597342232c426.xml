<headline>High Wind Warning issued January 17 at 1:08PM MST until January 18 at 9:00PM MST by NWS Midland-Odessa</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM CST /8 AM MST/ TO 10 PM
CST /9 PM MST/ WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...In the Guadalupe and Delaware Mountains, west winds 45 to
60 mph with gusts up to 80 mph expected. Elsewhere, west winds
30 to 50 mph with gusts up to 65 mph expected.
* WHERE...Portions of the higher elevations and adjacent plains
of southeast New Mexico and southwest and western Texas.
* WHEN...From 9 AM CST /8 AM MST/ to 10 PM CST /9 PM MST/
Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be difficult, especially for high profile
vehicles. Severe turbulence near the mountains will be hazardous
for low flying light aircraft. Winds will be particularly
hazardous at higher elevations where the strongest winds are
likely to occur. Be especially careful driving in these
mountainous areas. Blowing dust could reduce visibility across
the plains.</description>
<instruction>People should avoid being outside in forested areas and around
trees and branches. If possible, remain in the lower levels of
your home during the windstorm, and avoid windows. Use caution if
you must drive.</instruction>
