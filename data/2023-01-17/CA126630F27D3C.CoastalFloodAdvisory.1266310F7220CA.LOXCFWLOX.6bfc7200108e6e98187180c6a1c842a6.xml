<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued January 17 at 8:23AM PST until January 18 at 10:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST
WEDNESDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding.
For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 8 to 12
feet subsiding to 5 to 8 feet Tuesday in the afternoon.
Dangerous rip currents are also expected.
* WHERE...Catalina and Santa Barbara Islands, Malibu Coast and
Los Angeles County Beaches.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 10 PM PST
Wednesday. For the High Surf Advisory, until 10 PM PST this
evening.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely, around the time of
high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as
parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to
roads or structures is NOT expected. There is an increased
risk ocean drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers and
surfers out to sea. Large breaking waves can cause injury,
wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats
near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Minor coastal flooding is possible around
the time of high tide, causing inundation of sea water in low
lying coastal areas and minor beach erosion. For LA County
beaches, high tides will be 6 feet at 449 AM on Tuesday, and
6.7 feet at 544 AM on Wednesday. Even higher tides are
forecast for Thursday through Monday with tides 7.2 feet or
higher, peaking Saturday and Sunday near 7.8 feet between 830
AM to 925 AM. Coastal flooding is likely to persist through
early next week.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
