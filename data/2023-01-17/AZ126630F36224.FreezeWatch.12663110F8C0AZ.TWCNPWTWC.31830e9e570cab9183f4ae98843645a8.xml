<description>...FREEZE WATCH IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY EVENING THROUGH THURSDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Sub-freezing temperatures as low as 30 possible.
* WHERE...Tohono O`odham Nation, Tucson Metro Area, South
Central Pinal County and Southeast Pinal County.
* WHEN...From late Wednesday evening through Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Frost and freeze conditions could kill sensitive
vegetation and possibly damage unprotected outdoor plumbing.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The watch area has not had widespread sub-

couple of weeks lows have generally been mild in the 40s. Given
that, preparation may be needed to protect pipes, plants and pets!</description>

freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
