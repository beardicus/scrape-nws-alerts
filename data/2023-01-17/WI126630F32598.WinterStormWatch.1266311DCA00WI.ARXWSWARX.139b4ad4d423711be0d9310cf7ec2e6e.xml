<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 17 at 2:54PM CST until January 19 at 6:00PM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Winter Storm Wednesday night into Thursday...Heavy Wet Snow
Likely...
.A winter storm will start to push into parts of northeast Iowa
late Wednesday afternoon, spreading northeast through the rest of
the night. The snow is likely to be heaviest overnight, with 1 to
2&quot; per hour rates possible. The snow will taper off as it lifts
northeast later Thursday morning.
While several inches of wet snow are currently expected, where
that falls and just how much hinges on the storm track...and that
could shift. Warmer air could also cause a rain-snow mix in
southwest Wisconsin and lessen snow totals. In addition, there
could be a short period of freezing drizzle as the snow ends.
Stay weather aware heading into Wednesday and Thursday,
especially if you have travel plans.
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT
THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Heavy snow with 4 to 8 inches possible.
* WHERE...Taylor and Clark Counties.
* WHEN...From late Wednesday night through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous
conditions could impact the Thursday morning commute.</description>
