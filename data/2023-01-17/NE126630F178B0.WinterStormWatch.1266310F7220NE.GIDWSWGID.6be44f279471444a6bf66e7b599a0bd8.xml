<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 17 at 3:56AM CST until January 19 at 12:00AM CST by NWS Hastings</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH NOW IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH
WEDNESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation possible. Snow amounts ranging
from 3 to 6 inches. In addition, freezing rain could produce ice
accumulation up to around one tenth of an inch. Winds will
average 15 to 20 MPH with gusts to around 30 MPH, initially out
of the northeast but then turning northwesterly Wednesday night.
* WHERE...York and Fillmore Counties.
* WHEN...From late tonight through Wednesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous
conditions may develop in time to impact the Wednesday morning
commute, but there is greater confidence in impacts to the
Wednesday evening commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Please expect at least minor adjustments
to later snowfall forecasts, as confidence levels in snow
amounts at any given location is currently considered only
medium. This is due to continued uncertainty in the exact
storm track, and the location of a likely sharp transition
from heavy snow to wintry mix.</description>
