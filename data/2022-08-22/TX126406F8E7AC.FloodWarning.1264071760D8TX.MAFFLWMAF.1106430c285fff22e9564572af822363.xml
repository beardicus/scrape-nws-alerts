<headline>Flood Warning issued August 22 at 7:51PM CDT until August 24 at 7:22PM CDT by NWS Midland-Odessa</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Midland/Odessa TX has issued a
Flood Warning for the following rivers in Texas...
Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch affecting Brewster County.
Rio Grande at Boquillas affecting Brewster County.
.Thunderstorms have produced very heavy rainfall over the past few
days in Mexico over the Rio Conchos basin.  As a result, very high
flows are coming out of the Rio Conchos into the Rio Grande at
Presidio.  This activity will continue at least over the next few
days. Additional rainfall over the next few days could result in
additional rises and/or flooding.
For the Rio Grande...including Johnson Ranch, Boquillas...Minor
flooding is forecast.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY EVENING TO WEDNESDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch.
* WHEN...From Tuesday evening to Wednesday evening.
* IMPACTS...At 12.0 feet (3.7 meters), the river reaches bankfull,
minor lowland flooding occurs, and no significant damage is
expected.
At 15.0 feet (4.6 meters), flood stage is reached.  Moderate
lowland flooding begins.  Roads that lead to Cottonwood Campground
and River Road may flood.  Stages are practically synonymous with
the gage at Cottonwood Campground at Castolon (CSTT2), and
therefore represent the reach from Santa Elena Canyon through
Cottonwood Campground, where damage may occur.  Cattle also graze
in the lowlands, and may be threatened.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 7:15 PM CDT Monday the stage was 10.6 feet (3.2 meters).
- Forecast...The river will rise to 14.5 feet (4.4 meters)
tomorrow morning. It will then fall to 14.1 feet (4.3 meters)
tomorrow afternoon. It will rise above flood stage tomorrow
evening to 16.6 feet (5.1 meters) early Wednesday morning. It
will then fall below flood stage Wednesday morning.
- Flood stage is 15.0 feet (4.6 meters).
- Flood History...No available flood history.
