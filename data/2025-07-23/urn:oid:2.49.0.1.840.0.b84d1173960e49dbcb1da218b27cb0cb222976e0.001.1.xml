        <headline>Special Weather Statement issued July 23 at 7:46PM ChST by NWS Tiyan GU</headline>
        <description>The Joint Typhoon Warning Center has issued a Tropical Cyclone
Formation Alert for Invest 98W, centered near 12.9N, 145.0E,
meaning that 98W is expected to develop into a significant
tropical cyclone (Tropical Depression) within 24 hours. As 98W
pushes across the southern Marianas and then off to the north and
west of the islands over the next couple of days, a strong
southwest monsoon surge is expected to develop across the Marianas
in its wake. Heavy rainfall and breezy to windy conditions are
expected across the Marianas through Saturday with the passage of
98W and the ensuing monsoon surge.

Rainfall amounts of 6 to 12 inches are possible across the region
through Saturday night, with locally higher amounts also possible.
With the expected prolonged and heavy rainfall over the coming
days, there will be a growing concern for mudslides potential. A
Flood Watch is in effect through Saturday night.

Winds and seas will become hazardous to small craft, with winds 20
to 30 kt and gusts to 40 kt and seas 8 to 12 feet anticipated by
Thursday night. A Small Craft Advisory is in currently in effect for
Tinian and Saipan, and will begin for Guam and Rota beginning
Thursday morning, continuing through Saturday night.

Surf is expected to rise along east and south facing reefs first
beginning Thursday, then transition to south and west facing
reefs as 98W pushes to the northwest and the southwesterly monsoon
intensifies in its wake. This will cause the surf and risk of rip
currents to rise along south and west facing reefs as surf will
exceed the 9 foot threshold. Surf and rip risk look to remain
hazardous through much of the weekend.

For more information on Invest 98W (TCFA), see bulletins issued by
JTWC under WMO header WTPN21 PGTW.

Residents across the Marianas should continue monitoring local
weather forecasts from the National Weather Service in Guam, and for
additional information from your local emergency management office.
