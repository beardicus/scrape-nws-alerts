        <headline>Air Quality Alert issued July 23 at 10:56PM CDT by NWS Green Bay WI</headline>
        <description>The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has issued an Air
Quality Advisory for the following counties: Ashland, Barron,
Bayfield, Burnett, Chippewa, Douglas, Dunn, Iron, Pepin, Pierce,
Polk, Price, Rusk, Sawyer, St. Croix, Vilas, Washburn.

WHAT...The PM2.5 AQI is expected to reach the Unhealthy for
Sensitive Groups (USG) to Unhealthy level.

WHERE...Northwest Wisconsin.

WHEN...Beginning at 6 AM Thursday morning.

Precautionary/Preparedness Actions:
Sensitive groups: Consider rescheduling or moving all activities
inside. Go inside if you have symptoms.

People with asthma: Follow your asthma action plan and keep
quick-relief medicine handy.

People with heart disease: Symptoms such as palpitations,
shortness of breath, or unusual fatigue may indicate a serious
problem. If you have any of these, contact your health care
provider.

Everyone else: Keep outdoor activities shorter and less intense.
Go inside if you have symptoms.

Additional Details:
Canadian wildfire smoke will move into northwest Wisconsin
Thursday morning, likely reaching the Duluth/Superior area
between 6 and 9 AM. The smoke will then slowly move southeast
throughout the day on Thursday, approximately reaching an Eau
Claire-to-Rhinelander line by midnight Thursday night. The
Wisconsin DNR will update the advisory area on Thursday afternoon
to reflect the newest models and observations.

Currently, the smoke is expected to continue moving east and
south, impacting much of northern Wisconsin on Friday, with the
potential to move travel down Green Bay and Lake Michigan into
southern Wisconsin. Southerly winds are expected to begin pushing
the smoke back north on Saturday, but lingering smoke impacts
could mean an advisory will be necessary for at least some part
of Wisconsin over the weekend.
