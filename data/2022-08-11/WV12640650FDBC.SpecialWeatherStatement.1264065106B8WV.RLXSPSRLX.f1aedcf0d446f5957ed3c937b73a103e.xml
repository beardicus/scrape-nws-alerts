<headline>Special Weather Statement issued August 11 at 8:07PM EDT  by NWS Charleston</headline>
<description>...A strong thunderstorm will impact portions of northwestern Wirt
and southern Wood Counties through 830 PM EDT...

unsecured objects. Torrential rainfall is occurring with
this storm.

Parkersburg, Belpre, Lubeck, Washington, Mineralwells, Belleville,
Blennerhassett, Davisville, Greencastle, Morristown, Rockport and

Interstate 77 in West Virginia between mile markers 157 and 174.

<instruction>If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.
Torrential rainfall is also occurring with this storm and may lead to
localized flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flooded
roadways.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to travel across
flooded roads. Find alternate routes. It takes only a few inches of
swiftly flowing water to carry vehicles away.
Do not drive your vehicle into areas where the water covers the
roadway. The water depth may be too great to allow your car to cross
safely. Move to higher ground.</instruction>
