<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT MDT TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Arroyo and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of east central Utah, including the following
county, Grand.
* WHEN...Until midnight MDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
Rises in small streams and normally dry arroyos. Dangerous flows
over low-water crossings.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 847 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms. This will cause arroyo and small stream
flooding. Between 0.4 and 0.7 inches of rain have fallen.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 0.3 to 0.6 inches are expected
over the area. This additional rain will result in minor
flooding.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
mainly rural areas of Northeastern Grand County</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Remain alert for flooding even in locations not receiving rain.
Arroyos, streams, and rivers can become raging killer currents in a
matter of minutes, even from distant rainfall.</instruction>
