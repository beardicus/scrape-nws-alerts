<description>...SNOW CHANGING TO RAIN, LIKELY HEAVY, WITH RISING SNOW LEVELS
LATE WEEK IN UPPER LYNN CANAL...
An atmospheric river late this week into the weekend will bring
warming temperatures, rising snow levels, and the potential for
accumulating snow changing to heavy rain. Upper Lynn Canal will
receive light to moderate snow Wednesday. A winter weather
advisory is posted for Haines Wednesday morning through Wednesday
evening for 3 to 6 inches of new snow. A short break is possible
Thursday afternoon through Thursday evening before heavy
precipitation moves in late Thursday night. At sea level, the
precipitation may start as a mix of snow and rain before quickly
changing to all rain, heavy at times. Snow will hang on longer for
the Haines and Klondike highways and at higher elevations, with
heavy snow possible near the Canadian border of the Klondike
highway. Rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches are possible from
Thursday night through Sunday. Snowfall amounts of 5 to 9 inches
are possible out the Haines highway and up to 12 inches at White
Pass with lower amounts at lower elevations. Snow levels are
forecast to rise to around 2,500 feet or higher which could lead
to a melting mountain snowpack and introduce some nuisance
flooding concerns. Rain at White Pass is not out of the question.
Rain over deep snow on top of structures and rooftops could
challenge load limits across Upper Lynn Canal. Please stay tuned
to the forecast as it is refined through the week.</description>
