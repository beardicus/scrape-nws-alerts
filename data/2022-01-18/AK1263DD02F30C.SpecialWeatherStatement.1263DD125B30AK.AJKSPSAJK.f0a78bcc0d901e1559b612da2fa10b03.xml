<description>...SNOW CHANGING TO RAIN, LIKELY HEAVY, WITH RISING SNOW LEVELS
LATE WEEK...
Signals continue to point to a possible atmospheric river event
late this week into the weekend including warming temperatures,
rising snow levels, and the potential for accumulating snow
changing to heavy rain. Upper Lynn Canal will receive light to
moderate snow. A winter weather advisory is posted for Haines for
this evening. A short break is possible Thursday and Thursday
night before heavy precipitation starts Friday morning. At sea
level, the precipitation may start as a mix of snow and rain
before quickly changing to all rain, heavy at times. Snow will
hang on longer for the Haines and Klondike highways and at higher
elevations, with heavy snow possible near the Canadian border of
the Klondike highway. Rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches are
possible from Friday through Sunday. Snowfall amounts of 5 to 9
inches are possible out the Haines highway and up to 12 inches at
White Pass with lower amounts at lower elevations. Snow levels
are forecast to rise to around 2,500 feet which could lead to a
melting mountain snowpack and introduce some nuisance flooding
concerns. Rain over deep snow on top of structures and rooftops
could challenge load limits. Please stay tuned to the forecast as
it is refined through the week.</description>
