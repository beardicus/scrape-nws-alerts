<headline>Air Stagnation Advisory issued January 18 at 6:48AM PST until January 18 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...FREEZING FOG ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST THIS
MORNING...
...AIR STAGNATION ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST THIS
MORNING...
* WHAT...For the Freezing Fog Advisory, visibility a quarter
mile or less in freezing fog. For the Air Stagnation Advisory,
stagnant air is expected, which may lead to deteriorating air
quality.
* WHERE...For the Freezing Fog Advisory, much of I-5 and highway
199 including Grants Pass, Cave Junction and Obrien, but also
Agness. For the Air Stagnation Advisory, Valleys in eastern
Curry and Josephine Counties. This includes the Rogue Valley,
Applegate Valley and Illinois Valley.
* WHEN...Until 10 AM PST this morning.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous driving conditions due to low visibility
and potential frost on bridges. Air stagnation is likely to
result in diminishing air quality with time, especially in and
near areas with significant sources of air pollution.
Diminished air quality is likely to cause health issues for
people with respiratory problems if precautions are not taken.

https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/map/?wfo=mfr</description>
<instruction>If driving, slow down, use your headlights, and leave plenty of
distance ahead of you. Also, be alert for frost on bridge decks
causing slippery roads.
People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with diminished air quality. N95 masks are
effective at filtering out the majority of harmful air
particulates.
State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor
burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be
limited as much as possible. According to state air quality
agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants
close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with
your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
