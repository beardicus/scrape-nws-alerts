<description>...HEAVY RAIN POSSIBLE WITH RISING SNOW LEVELS LATE WEEK FOR MISTY
FJORDS...
Signals continue to point to a possible atmospheric river event
late this week into the weekend including warming temperatures,
rising snow levels, and the potential for heavy rain. Following a
mid-week period of winter weather with a winter weather advisory
posted Wednesday afternoon through Thursday morning, precipitation
will change to rain Thursday. Initially the heaviest rain is
expected to be focused on the northern panhandle. The moisture
stream is expected to gradually slide southward through the
weekend, but there is uncertainty regarding the timing and
duration of heavy rain over Misty Fjords. The current forecast is
for rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches from Thursday evening
through Sunday, with the heaviest precipitation possible Saturday
through Sunday. Snow levels are forecast to rise to 3,000 to 5,000
feet. Rain along with a melting mountain snowpack will increase
the risk of minor flooding issues. Please stay tuned to the
forecast as it is refined through the week.</description>
