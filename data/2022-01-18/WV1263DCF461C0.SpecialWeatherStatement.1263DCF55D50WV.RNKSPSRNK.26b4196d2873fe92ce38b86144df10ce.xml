<description>...Winter Weather and Wind Advisory Ended at 100 AM EST This
Morning...
The Winter Weather Advisory for additional minor accumulations of
snow and blowing snow ended at 100 AM EST this morning. While
some snow showers may linger in the area through the early morning
hours, additional accumulations of snow are expected to be little
more than a trace. Note, however, gusty west to northwest winds of
15 to 25 mph will continue through the morning allowing for areas
of blowing snow. Those planning to venture out early this morning
should be prepared for areas of ice and snow that remain on some
roads and even areas that were previously plowed may have a layer
of snow on them once again as snow blows and drifts around in the
strong winds. Not all roads may be cleared as well. Use extreme
caution if you plan to travel this morning and allow extra time to
reach your destination. Also, use extreme caution on snow and ice
covered sidewalks and walkways as you venture about this morning.
Only limited improvement in these conditions is expected today as
temperatures largely remain below freezing.
Wind chill readings early this morning will be in the single
digits and teens above zero. Those planning to venture out should
wear layers of clothing to protect from the bitter cold.</description>
