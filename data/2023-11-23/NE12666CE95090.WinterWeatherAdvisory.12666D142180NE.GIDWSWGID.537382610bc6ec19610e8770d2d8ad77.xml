<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued November 23 at 1:40PM CST until November 25 at 6:00PM CST by NWS Hastings</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER CONDITIONS HEADED TO PORTIONS OF SOUTH CENTRAL
NEBRASKA AS EARLY AS FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND EXPANDING INTO NORTH
CENTRAL KANSAS SATURDAY...
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT FROM NOON FRIDAY TO 6 PM
CST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 2 and 4
inches.
* WHERE...Dawson, Furnas, and Gosper Counties.
* WHEN...From noon Friday to 6 PM CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...It will not snow throughout the entire
duration of this Advisory, with snow instead falling
intermittently. There is also some uncertainty in snow amounts, as
dry air could potentially delay the onset of snow and reduce
amounts, especially on Friday. No matter how much it snows,
confidence is high that blowing and drifting snow will not be a
significant issue, with winds only averaging 5 to 15 MPH, from the
east most of the time but shifting to westerly Saturday afternoon.</description>
