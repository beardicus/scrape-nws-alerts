<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 15 at 3:59AM PST until December 16 at 1:00PM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM THIS
EVENING TO 1 PM PST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 3 to 7 inches
along Highway 395, 7 to 14 inches west of Highway 395 including
Mammoth Lakes, and up to 20 inches near the Sierra crest.
Lighter amounts up to 1 inch in the Chalfant Valley. Winds
gusting up to 45 mph with Sierra ridge gusts to near 100 mph.
* WHERE...Mono County.
* WHEN...From 7 PM this evening to 1 PM PST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult across the Eastern
Sierra. The hazardous conditions will impact the Thursday
morning commute. Delays likely with road closures possible.
Strong winds could cause tree damage and power outages. Expect
periods of poor visibility in blowing snow.</description>
<instruction>The combination of this new snowfall and gusty winds with
existing snow cover could cause major travel delays, especially
during periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time
to reach your destination. Leave extra space between vehicles
since it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
