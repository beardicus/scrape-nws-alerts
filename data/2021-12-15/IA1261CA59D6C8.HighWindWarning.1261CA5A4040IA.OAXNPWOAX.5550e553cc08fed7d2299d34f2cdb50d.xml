<headline>High Wind Warning issued December 15 at 7:30PM CST until December 15 at 10:00PM CST by NWS Omaha</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM CST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...West or northwest winds over the area will remain strong
with gusts to 50 or 60 mph possible through around 10 pm.
Storms moved off to the east earlier, but these winds are due to
the strong pressure gradient associated with a stronger area of
low pressure moving through the region.
* WHERE...Portions of northeast Nebraska and west central Iowa.
* WHEN...Until 10 PM CST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Damaging winds could blow down trees and power lines.
Widespread power outages may occur. Damage to structures will be
possible. Travel will be difficult, especially for high profile
vehicles. Unsecured outdoor objects may be blown away. If any
fires start, they could be hard to control due to the wind.
Areas of blowing snow will remain possible through about 10 pm.</description>
<instruction>People should avoid being outside in forested areas and around
trees and branches. If possible, remain in the lower levels of
your home during the windstorm, and avoid windows. Use caution if
you must drive.</instruction>
