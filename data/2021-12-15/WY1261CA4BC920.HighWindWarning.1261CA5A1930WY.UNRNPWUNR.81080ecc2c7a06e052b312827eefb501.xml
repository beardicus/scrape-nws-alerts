8 PM MST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Northwest winds 25 to 35 mph with gusts up to 60 mph
expected.
* WHERE...Portions of northeast Wyoming and southwestern South
Dakota. This includes the Tribal Lands of the Pine Ridge

* WHEN...From 11 AM this morning to 8 PM MST this evening.
* IMPACTS...The high winds may blow down large trees and damage

profile vehicles. Strong winds can cause blowing dust, reduced
visibility, and flying debris.

may injure you. If you are driving, be prepared for sudden wind
gusts that can cause you to lose control of your vehicle,
especially on open stretches, or as you approach the crest of
hills. Also be alert for debris or dust blowing across the road.</instruction>
