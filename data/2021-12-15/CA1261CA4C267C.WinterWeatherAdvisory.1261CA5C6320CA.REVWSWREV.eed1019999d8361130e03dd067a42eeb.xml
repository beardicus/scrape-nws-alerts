Eastern Sierra Counties and Northern Washoe County.
* WHEN...From 1 PM this afternoon to 10 AM PST Thursday. Heaviest
snowfall rates between 3 PM this afternoon and midnight.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be difficult with poor visibility due to
falling and blowing snow. Plan for delays, possibly
significant. The hazardous conditions will impact this evening`s

<instruction>The combination of this new snowfall and gusty winds with
existing snow cover could cause major travel delays, especially
during periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time
to reach your destination. Leave extra space between vehicles
since it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
