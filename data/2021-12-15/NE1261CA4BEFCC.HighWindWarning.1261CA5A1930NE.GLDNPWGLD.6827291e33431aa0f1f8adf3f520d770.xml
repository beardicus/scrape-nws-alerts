<senderName>NWS Goodland (Northwestern Kansas and East Central Colorado)</senderName>
<headline>High Wind Warning issued December 15 at 4:19AM CST until December 15 at 9:00PM CST by NWS Goodland</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM MST /9 AM CST/
THIS MORNING TO 8 PM MST /9 PM CST/ THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Southwest to Northwest at 40 to 55 mph with gusts up to
75 mph. A few gusts up to 85 mph are possible, mainly south
and southwest of Goodland.
* WHERE...Entire Tri-State area.
* WHEN...From 8 AM MST /9 AM CST/ to 8 PM MST /9 PM CST/
Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Wind of this magnitude can down trees, power lines,
and create flying debris.. which may lead to power outages,
transportation disruptions, damage to buildings and vehicles,
and injury or death. High winds will create dangerous travel
conditions, especially on high speed limit, high traffic
routes such as Interstate 70. Reduced visibilities associated
with blowing dust will exacerbate already difficult travel
conditions and create very poor air quality.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Several abrupt wind shifts are
anticipated during the day on Wednesday. Winds will abruptly
shift from S to WSW during the late morning and early
afternoon. Winds will abruptly shift from WSW to NW during the
mid to late afternoon.</description>
<instruction>The safest place to be during high winds, is indoors. If you must
drive, watch for objects blowing across the roadway and into your
path. Keep a safe distance from cars in adjacent lanes as strong
gusts could suddenly push a vehicle outside its lane of travel.
Take extra care in high-profile vehicles such as a truck, van, or
SUV, or when towing a trailer, as these are more prone to be
pushed or flipped by high winds.
High dust concentrations can aggravate asthma and cause
respiratory problems, especially in children, the elderly, or
those with pre-existing respiratory conditions. The Kansas
Department of Health and Environment recommends taking
preventative measures such as staying indoors or wearing
protective breathing masks, if outside.</instruction>
