SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------

Hurricane Erin has strengthened back to a category 3 hurricane once
again, making it a major hurricane this morning. Erin will continue
to track northwards today before turning to the north and east on
Friday with the system making its closest point of approach to the
Outer Banks and North Carolina coast Thursday morning. While the
center of Erin is expected to remain a couple hundred miles off the
North Carolina coast, significant coastal impacts are expected
across eastern North Carolina due to its large size into the end of
the week.

Moderate to significant storm surge inundation of 2 to 4 feet above
ground level is expected along the oceanside north of Cape Lookout,
resulting in a significant threat to life and property. The worst
impacts will likely be felt along the Outer Banks on Ocracoke and
Hatteras Island. This is expected to be a prolonged duration event
which is already ongoing and will peak this evening through
Thursday, then gradually improving late week into the weekend.
Portions of NC-12 and secondary roads along the Outer Banks, in
particular on Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands, will likely be
impassable or inaccessible through much of this week due to
significant ocean overwash. Minor to locally moderate inundation of
1 to 3 ft will also be possible for soundside areas adjacent to the
southern Pamlico Sound on Thursday and possibly into Friday.

Erin is expected to increase in size over the next few days and
tropical storm force winds will be felt tonight into Thursday
for eastern coastal areas, particularly on the Outer Banks.

Strong rip currents are expected along area beaches through the
week. Extensive beach erosion is also likely due to strong long
period waves as high as 10 to 20 feet in the surf zone, highest on
the Outer Banks.

Very dangerous marine conditions will continue for the coastal
waters, sounds and rivers, with gusty winds and dangerous seas.
This will create treacherous conditions for mariners.

POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------

* SURGE:
Protect against life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across the Outer Banks from Duck to Cape Lookout. Potential
impacts in this area include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.

Also, protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across the Crystal Coast. Some minor to locally moderate inundation
is also possible for soundside locations on the the southern end of
the Pamlico Sound tonight into Thursday, and perhaps into early
Friday.

Elsewhere across Eastern North Carolina, little to no impact is
anticipated.

* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
the Outer Banks southward to Cape Lookout, and adjacent coastal
communities on Pamlico and Albemarle Sound. Potential impacts in this
area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.

Elsewhere across Eastern North Carolina, little to no impact is
anticipated.

* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across Coastal Eastern North Carolina. Potential
impacts include:
- Ponding of water on roadways may cause instances of localized
flooding.
- 1 to 2 inches of rain is possible today into Thursday, especially
where heavier rain bands develop near the coast.

Elsewhere across Eastern North Carolina, little to no impact is
anticipated.

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------

* EVACUATIONS:
Follow the advice of local officials. Portions of Dare and Hyde
counties are under mandatory evacuation orders.

* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.

If you are relocating to safe shelter, leave as early as possible.
Allow extra time to reach your destination. Many roads and bridges
will be closed once strong winds arrive. Check the latest weather
forecast before departing and drive with caution.

If heading to a community shelter, become familiar with the shelter
rules before arrival, especially if you have special needs or have
pets. Take essential items with you from your Emergency Supplies Kit.

Failure to adequately shelter may result in serious injury or loss of
life. Always heed the advice of local officials and comply with any
orders that are issued. Remember, during the storm 9 1 1 Emergency
Services may not be able to immediately respond if conditions are
unsafe. This should be a big factor in your decision making.

Keep cell phones well charged. Cell phone chargers for automobiles
can be helpful, but be aware of your risk for deadly carbon monoxide
poisoning if your car is left idling in a garage or other poorly
ventilated area.

It is important to remain calm, informed, and focused during an
emergency. Be patient and helpful with those you encounter.

If you are a visitor, be sure to know the name of the city or town in
which you are staying and the name of the county or parish in which
it resides. Listen for these locations in local news updates. Pay
attention for instructions from local authorities.

Storm surge is the leading killer associated with tropical storms and
hurricanes! Make sure you are in a safe area away from the surge
zone. Even if you are not in a surge-prone area, you could find
yourself cutoff by flood waters during and after the storm. Heed
evacuation orders issued by the local authorities.

If in a place that is vulnerable to high wind, such as near large
trees, a manufactured home, upper floors of a high-rise building, or
on a boat, consider moving to a safer shelter before the onset of
strong winds or flooding.

Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
