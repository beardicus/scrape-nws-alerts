        <headline>Coastal Flood Watch issued August 20 at 3:05AM EDT until August 22 at 12:00AM EDT by NWS Upton NY</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, life-threatening rip currents.
For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 7 to 11
feet expected in the surf zone today, 12 to 16 feet on Thursday
and 8 to 12 feet on Friday. For the Coastal Flood Watch,
one to two feet of inundation above ground level possible in
vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline.

* WHERE...Southwest Suffolk, Southeast Suffolk and Southern
Nassau Counties.

* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Friday evening.
For the High Surf Advisory, from 6 AM this morning to 8 PM EDT
Friday. For the Coastal Flood Watch, Thursday evening.

* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Widespread moderate flooding in the more
vulnerable locations near the waterfront and shoreline. Some roads
and low lying properties including parking lots, parks, lawns, and
homes and businesses with basements near the waterfront will experience
minor flooding.

* SWIMMING IMPACTS...Life-threatening swimming and surfing conditions
and localized beach erosion. Life-threatening rip currents are
likely for all people entering the surf zone. Anyone visiting
the beaches should stay out of the surf. Rip currents can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.

* SHORELINE IMPACTS...The threat for beach flooding, beach
erosion and escarpment and areas of dune erosion will increase
with successive high tides Tue eve thru Fri morning.
Widespread areas of dune erosion with localized overwashes are
expected during the Thu evening and Fri morning high tides.

        <instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.

Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.

If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
