SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------

Hurricane Erin is a Category 2 hurricane this morning and may regain
major hurricane status as it moves northward today. While the center of
Erin is expected to remain a couple hundred miles off the North
Carolina coast, significant coastal impacts are expected across eastern
North Carolina due to its large size into the end of the week.

Moderate to significant storm surge inundation of 2 to 4 feet above
ground level is expected along the oceanside north of Cape Lookout,
resulting in a significant threat to life and property. The worst
impacts will likely be felt along the Outer Banks on Ocracoke and
Hatteras Island. This is expected to be a prolonged duration event
which is already ongoing and will peak late today through Thursday,
then gradually improving late week into the weekend. Portions of NC-
12 and secondary roads along the Outer Banks, in particular on
Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands, will likely be impassable or
inaccessible through much of this week due to significant ocean
overwash. Minor to locally moderate inundation of 1 to 3 ft will also
be possible for soundside areas adjacent to the southern Pamlico Sound
on Thursday and possibly into Friday.

Erin is expected to increase in size over the next few days and
tropical storm force winds will be felt tonight into Thursday for
eastern coastal areas, particularly on the Outer Banks.

Strong rip currents are expected along area beaches through the week.
Extensive beach erosion is also likely due to strong long period waves
as high as 10 to 20 feet in the surf zone, highest on the Outer Banks.

Very dangerous marine conditions will continue for the coastal waters,
sounds and rivers, with gusty winds and dangerous seas. This will
create treacherous conditions for mariners.

POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------

* SURGE:
Protect against life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across the Outer Banks from Duck to Cape Lookout. Potential
impacts in this area include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.

Also, protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across the Crystal Coast. Some minor to locally moderate inundation
is also possible for soundside locations on the the southern end of
the Pamlico Sound tonight into Thursday, and perhaps into early
Friday.

Elsewhere across Eastern North Carolina, little to no impact is
anticipated.

* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
the Outer Banks southward to Cape Lookout, and adjacent coastal
communities on Pamlico and Albemarle Sound. Potential impacts in this
area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.

Elsewhere across Eastern North Carolina, little to no impact is
anticipated.

* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across Coastal Eastern North Carolina. Potential
impacts include:
- Ponding of water on roadways may cause instances of localized
flooding.
- 1 to 2 inches of rain is possible today into Thursday, especially
where heavier rain bands develop near the coast.


Elsewhere across Eastern North Carolina, little to no impact is
anticipated.

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------

* EVACUATIONS:
Follow the advice of local officials. Portions of Dare and Hyde
counties are under mandatory evacuation orders.

* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies
kit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your
home or business.

When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.

If in a place that is vulnerable to high wind, such as near large
trees, a manufactured home, upper floors of a high-rise building, or
on a boat, plan to move to safe shelter.

If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
near the ocean or a large inland lake, in a low-lying or poor
drainage area, in a valley, or near an already swollen river, plan to
move to safe shelter on higher ground.

Always heed the advice of local officials and comply with orders that
are issued. Do not needlessly jeopardize your life or the lives of
others.

When securing your property, outside preparations should be concluded
as soon as possible before conditions deteriorate. The onset of
strong gusty winds or flooding can cause certain preparedness
activities to become unsafe.

Check on those who may not be fully aware of the situation or who are
unable to make personal preparations.

If you are a visitor, know the name of the county or parish in which
you are located and where it is relative to current watches and
warnings. If staying at a hotel, ask the management staff about their
onsite disaster plan. Listen for evacuation orders, especially
pertaining to area visitors.

Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes
to the forecast.
