SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------

Hurricane Erin remains a Category 2 hurricane this evening. Erin
will continue to track northwards tonight and tomorrow before turning
to the north and east on Friday with the system making its closest
point of approach to the Outer Banks and North Carolina coast tomorrow
morning. While the center of Erin is expected to remain a couple
hundred miles off the North Carolina coast, significant coastal
impacts are expected across eastern North Carolina due to its large
size into the end of the week.

Moderate to significant storm surge inundation of 2 to 4 feet above
ground level is expected along the oceanside north of Cape Lookout,
resulting in a significant threat to life and property. The worst
impacts will likely be felt along the Outer Banks on Ocracoke and
Hatteras Island. This is expected to be a prolonged duration event
which is already ongoing and will peak through tomorrow, then
gradually improving late week into the weekend. Portions of NC-12 and
secondary roads along the Outer Banks, in particular on Hatteras and
Ocracoke Islands, are already closed and will likely remain impassable
or inaccessible through much of this week due to significant ocean
overwash. Minor to locally moderate inundation of 1 to 3 ft will also
be possible for soundside areas adjacent to the southern Pamlico Sound
tomorrow and possibly into Friday.

Erin will continue to increase in size over the next few days and
tropical storm force winds will be felt tonight into tomorrow for
eastern coastal areas, particularly on the Outer Banks.

Strong rip currents are expected along area beaches through the week.
Extensive beach erosion is also likely due to strong long period waves
as high as 10 to 20 feet in the surf zone, highest on the Outer Banks.

Very dangerous marine conditions will continue for the coastal waters,
sounds and rivers, with gusty winds and dangerous seas. This will
create treacherous conditions for mariners.

POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------

* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across
the Outer Banks from Duck to Cape Lookout. Remain well away from life-
threatening surge having additional significant impacts. If realized,
these impacts include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.

Potential impacts from the main surge event are also now unfolding
across the Crystal Coast. Remain well away from locally hazardous
surge having additional limited impacts.

Elsewhere across Eastern North Carolina, little to no impact is
anticipated.

* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across the
Outer Banks southward to Cape Lookout, and adjacent coastal communities
on Pamlico and Albemarle Sound. Remain well sheltered from hazardous
wind having possible limited impacts. If realized, these impacts
include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.

Elsewhere across Eastern North Carolina, little to no impact is
anticipated.

* OTHER COASTAL HAZARDS:
Life threatening rip currents and dangerous marine conditions will
persist through the week.

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------

* EVACUATIONS:
Follow the advice of local officials.


* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to stay inside and away from windows. Listen for
updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Keep a battery-
powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.

During the peak of the storm be ready to move quickly. Keep your
shoes on and rain gear handy. Boots and athletic shoes offer the best
foot protection if you become unexpectedly exposed to the weather.

Keep your cell phone charged and in power-saving mode. If you lose
power, use it sparingly and mainly for personal emergencies and
check-ins.

Do not be a thrill seeker or risk your life for senseless photos or
videos.

Quickly move to the safest place within your shelter if it begins to
fail, preferably an interior room on the lowest floor as long as
flooding is not a concern.

If you are prone to flooding or in an area under a storm surge watch
or warning, be prepared for the possibility of a quick and dramatic
rise in water levels.
