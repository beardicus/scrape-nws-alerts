<description>...WIND ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM SUNDAY TO 1 PM PST
MONDAY...
...FREEZE WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH
MONDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...For the Wind Advisory, north winds 15 to 30 mph with
gusts up to 50 mph expected. Highest peaks of the North Bay
could see gusts up to 70 mph. For the Freeze Watch, sub-
freezing temperatures as low as 32 possible.
* WHERE...North Bay Interior Mountains and North Bay Interior
Valleys.
* WHEN...For the Wind Advisory, from 1 PM Sunday to 1 PM PST
Monday. For the Freeze Watch, from late Sunday night through
Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...Gusty winds could blow around unsecured objects.
Tree limbs could be blown down and a few power outages may
result. Frost and freeze conditions will impact unsheltered
and marginally sheltered populations, kill crops/sensitive
vegetation, impact outdoor pets/livestock, and possibly damage
unprotected outdoor plumbing.</description>
<instruction>Use extra caution when driving, especially if operating a high
profile vehicle. Secure outdoor objects.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
