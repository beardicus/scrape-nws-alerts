<description>...Quick Hitting Winter Storm Sunday Followed By Bitterly Cold
Temperatures...
* Snow will begin to push into the region Sunday morning working
from north to south through the day. The heavier band of snow
will only last up to a few hours in western Nevada with up to 6
hours as it transverses the Sierra. While a few light snow
showers may linger south of Mono Lake early Monday morning,
overall the system will be out of the area Monday. This will be
a cold system, with light powdery snow at all elevations. For
details on snow totals, please see the Winter Weather Advisory.
* It doesn`t take much for the snow to pack down into ice as cars
drive over it. Driving conditions may get messy Sunday, with
the potential for lingering icy conditions into the Monday
morning commute.
* For the latest roadway conditions call 5 1 1 or download
Caltran`s and NDOT`s smart phone applications, Quickmap and
NVRoads, respectively.
* This storm will also bring strong northeast winds on Sunday
leading to choppy lake and recreation impacts. Winds will also
drive wind chills into the teens and single digits on Sunday. Be
sure to bundle up!
* Frigid temperatures will settle into the region behind this
storm with highs remaining below freezing Monday and possibly
Tuesday. Overnight lows Monday night could be the coldest some
locations have seen in 5-10 years. Preparations should be made
to protect vulnerable populations and pets from these very cold
temperatures. It`s also a good idea to make sure that your pipes
are protected from the cold.</description>
