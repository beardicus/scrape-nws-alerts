or less in dense fog. For the Freeze Watch, sub-freezing
temperatures as low as 32 possible.
* WHERE...San Francisco Bay Shoreline.
* WHEN...For the Dense Fog Advisory, until 10 AM PST this

* IMPACTS...Frost and freeze conditions will impact unsheltered

<instruction>Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.
If driving, slow down, use your headlights, and leave plenty of
distance ahead of you.</instruction>
