<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 08 at 2:22PM CST until March 10 at 6:00AM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Winter Storm With Significant Accumulations Expected...
.A winter storm is still on track to bring heavy snow to the area.
The snow will overspread much of the area Thursday afternoon and
continue through the evening before tapering off late Thursday
night. Snowfall totals are expected to range from 5 to 9 inches
with some locally higher amounts possible.
Snowfall rates of an inch per hour look to be possible during the
afternoon and evening across northeast Iowa into southwest and
central Wisconsin. Rates this high will cause rapid accumulations
to occur with roads quickly becoming snow covered and dangerous
travel conditions developing. Considering altering travel plans if
necessary.
...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 3 PM THURSDAY TO 6 AM CST
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 5 to 7
inches. Rates of an inch per hour possible during the afternoon
and evening.
* WHERE...La Crosse, Vernon and Richland Counties.
* WHEN...From 3 PM Thursday to 6 AM CST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous
conditions could impact the evening commute.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
