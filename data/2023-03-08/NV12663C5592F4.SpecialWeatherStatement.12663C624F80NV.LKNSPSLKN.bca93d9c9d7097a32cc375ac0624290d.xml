<description>...An area of convective snow showers will move across
Elko County...
At 1226 PM this afternoon doppler radar is tracking an area of
scattered snow showers across northern Nevada moving from
southwest to northeast. Showers are beginning to move into Elko
County. SPC outlooks paired with environmental analysis indicate a
region of enhanced instability across Elko County. Snow showers
are expected to strengthen and produce brief periods of squall
like conditions. Heavy bands of snow and gusty winds with gusts
around 40 mph will be in the area. Visibility will be reduced to
1/2 mile or less under any such activity along with localized
light accumulations ranging from a skiff to 2 inches. Activity is
expected to exit the forecast area around 0800 PM.
Travel will become difficult under any such conditions and
extreme caution should be exercised if impacted by a band of heavy
snow. Slow down and turn on headlights. Pull off the highway if
needed and into a safe area and wait until conditons clear.
