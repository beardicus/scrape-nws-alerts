<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued March 08 at 10:37AM CST until March 10 at 6:00AM CST by NWS DesMoines</headline>
<description>...Winter Storm Expected Portions of Northern and Central Iowa on
Thursday into Thursday Night...
.There is the potential for a slight shift to the southwest for
the expected area of heavier snowfall. Some minor adjustments have
been made to the watch outline at this time.
A storm is expected to spread precipitation into Iowa toward
daybreak on Thursday. The precipitation is expected to expand
statewide during the day with rain in the far south, rain and
snow mixed in portions of southern and central Iowa and mainly
snow across the north half of the state. Moderate to heavy snow
accumulations are expected in the watch area by Thursday night.
...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY MORNING THROUGH
LATE THURSDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 4 to 6
inches possible. Strong winds may produce blowing snow as
well, reducing visibilities.
* WHERE...Portions of Central Iowa.
* WHEN...From Thursday morning through late Thursday night.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be problematic. Patchy blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the evening commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...There is some indication that heavier snow
could occur farther south and west than previous forecasts. Thus
these additional counties have been added to the watch area.</description>
