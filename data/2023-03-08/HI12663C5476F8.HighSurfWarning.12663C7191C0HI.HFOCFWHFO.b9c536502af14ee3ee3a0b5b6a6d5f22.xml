KAUAI OAHU AND MOLOKAI AND FOR NORTH FACING SHORES OF MAUI THROUGH
THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
...HIGH SURF WARNING FOR WEST FACING SHORES OF THE BIG ISLAND
FROM THIS EVENING THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
.A very large northwest swell will build today and peak tonight
into early Thursday. The combination of large wind waves from
strong west winds and a mix of medium and longer period swell
energy will produce very rough and hazardous conditions into
Thursday. The swell will gradually decline and shift out of the
north- northwest Friday through the weekend.
...HIGH SURF WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM THIS EVENING TO
6 PM HST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Dangerously large breaking waves of 10 to 15 feet along
west facing shores of the Big Island by Wednesday evening.
* WHERE...Kona and Kohala.
* WHEN...From 6 PM this evening to 6 PM HST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...High. Expect very strong breaking waves and powerful
currents. Waves breaking in channel entrances may make
navigating the channels dangerous.</description>
<instruction>Stay away from the shoreline along the affected coasts. Be
prepared for road closures. Postpone entering or leaving channels
affected by the high surf until the surf subsides.</instruction>
