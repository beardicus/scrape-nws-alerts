<headline>Flood Watch issued March 08 at 3:38PM PST until March 12 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>.Heavy rain with higher snow levels is expected to bring the risk of
flooding, mainly in areas below approximately 6500 feet. The main
impacts are expected to be on smaller creeks and streams and in
areas of poor drainage, but minor to moderate river flooding river
flooding can not be ruled out.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
SUNDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of California and western Nevada, including the
following areas, in California, Greater Lake Tahoe Area,
Lassen-Eastern Plumas-Eastern Sierra Counties and Mono County. In
western Nevada, Greater Lake Tahoe Area, Greater Reno-Carson
City-Minden Area and Mineral and Southern Lyon Counties.
* WHEN...From Thursday afternoon through Sunday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas due to deep snow confining flow
and limiting drainage. Low-water crossings may be flooded. Storm
drains and ditches may become clogged with snow and debris.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A warm atmospheric river will lead to rapid runoff in areas
of shallow snowpack and wet ground. Continued precipitation
on areas with deeper snowpack may begin to pass rain through
the snowpack during the prolonged precipitation event. This
will lead substantial hazard of minor flooding with
significant rises on main stem rivers. Flooding on mainstem
rivers is not forecast at this time, but rises to monitor
stage are now expected on the east fork of the Carson near
Gardnerville and the Carson River near Carson City. Minor or
even moderate river flooding can`t be ruled out.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
