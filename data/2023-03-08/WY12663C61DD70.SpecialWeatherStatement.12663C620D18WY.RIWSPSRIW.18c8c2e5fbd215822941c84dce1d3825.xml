<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WILL AFFECT PARTS OF EXTREME WESTERN SWEETWATER
COUNTY...
HAZARDS...A snow squall accompanied by winds of 15 TO 25 mph which
can rapidly reduce visibility to around a quarter of a mile.
LOCATION AND MOVEMENT...At 600 PM MST, a snow squall was 10 miles
southwest of Little America, or about 30 miles west of Green River
moving east around 20 to 30 mph.
THIS SQUALL WILL BE NEAR...
Little America around 630 PM.
Green River will begin to be impacted between 715 and 730 PM.
Rock Springs could be impacted around 8 PM, if this snow squall
remains together.
This includes Interstate 80 between mile markers 57 and 95.
The heaviest snow should last between 30 and 45 minutes. A quick
inch of snow could occur with roads becoming slick and hazardous.
SAFETY INFO... Use extra caution if you must travel into or through
this squall. Rapid changes in visibility and potentially slick roads
may lead to accidents.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time to reach your destination.
