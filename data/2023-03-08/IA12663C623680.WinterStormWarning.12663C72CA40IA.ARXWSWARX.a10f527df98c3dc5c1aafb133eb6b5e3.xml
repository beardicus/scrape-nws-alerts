<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 08 at 9:36PM CST until March 10 at 6:00AM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Winter Storm With Significant Accumulations Expected...
.A winter storm is still on track to bring heavy snow to the
area. The snow will overspread much of the area Thursday
afternoon and continue through the evening before tapering off
late Thursday night. Snowfall totals are expected to range from
5 to 9 inches with some locally higher amounts possible.
Snowfall rates of an inch per hour look to be possible during the
afternoon and evening across northeast Iowa into southwest and
central Wisconsin. Rates this high will cause rapid accumulations
to occur with roads quickly becoming snow covered and dangerous
travel conditions developing. Considering altering travel plans
if necessary.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON THURSDAY TO
6 AM CST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 5 to 9
inches. Rates of an inch per hour possible during the
afternoon and evening, especially across northeast Iowa into
Wisconsin.
* WHERE...Portions of northeast Iowa, southeast Minnesota and
southwest Wisconsin.
* WHEN...From noon Thursday to 6 AM CST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous
conditions could impact the evening commute.</description>
