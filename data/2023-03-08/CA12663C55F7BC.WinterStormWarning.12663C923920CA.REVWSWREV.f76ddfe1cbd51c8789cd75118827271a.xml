<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 08 at 3:11PM PST until March 12 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM PST THURSDAY TO 11 AM
PDT SUNDAY...
* CHANGES: Upgraded to Winter Storm Warning. Highlighted the
significant changes in snow levels through this storm.
* WHAT...Heavy snow with periods of heavy rain expected. Total
snow accumulations of up to 12 inches, except 2 to 6 feet above
6500 feet. Winds gusting as high as 60 mph with gusts up to 120
mph along the Sierra crest.
* WHERE...Greater Lake Tahoe Area.
* WHEN...From 4 PM PST Thursday to 11 AM PDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Very
strong winds combined with heavy snow could cause tree damage
and lead to power outages. Snow loading on structures will
increase due to the additional rain and snow being absorbed into
the deep snowpack, along with higher risks for dangerous
roofalanches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow levels are expected to fluctuate
significantly during the storm, initially starting around 6500
feet, rising to around 8500 Thursday night, then dropping to
6000-6500 feet Friday night into Saturday. Periods of higher
snow levels Thursday night into Friday brings the risk of
flooding in lower elevations--see the Flood Watch for more
details.</description>
<instruction>Avoid travel if possible, you could be stuck in your vehicle for
many hours. If you must travel, prepare for long delays and carry
an emergency kit with extra food, water and clothing. If you stay
home, have a backup plan in case of power outages.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.
Follow guidance from local officials and building inspectors for
ways to monitor and mitigate the risk of increased snow loads on
roofs.</instruction>
