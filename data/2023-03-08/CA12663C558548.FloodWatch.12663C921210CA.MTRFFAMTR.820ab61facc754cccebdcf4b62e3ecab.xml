<headline>Flood Watch issued March 08 at 12:18PM PST  by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>.A strong winter storm will impact the region Thursday into Friday
with showers lingering into Saturday and potentially Sunday. This
system is tapping into very moist subtropical moisture which will
allow for moderate to periods of heavy precipitation. The area with
the greatest probability of flooding includes the Santa Cruz
Mountains and Santa Lucia Mountains where the highest rainfall
amounts are expected.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
SUNDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Entire San Francisco Bay Area and Central Coast including
Monterey and San Benito Counties.
* WHEN...From Thursday afternoon through Sunday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams will see rapid rises.  Flooding may occur in
poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water crossings may be flooded.
Storm drains and ditches may become clogged with debris.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rainfall totals will range from 1.5 to 3 inches for most
urban areas with 3 to 6 inches in the coastal ranges and
inland hills. Up to 6 to 8 inches over the Santa Cruz
Mountains and locally up to 10 inches over favored peaks and
higher terrain of the Santa Lucia Mountains where prolonged
moderate to heavy precipitation and higher rain rates are
currently forecast. Pre-existing saturated soils will not be
able to absorb must of this rainfall and therefore will
quickly turn into runoff. Urban and small stream flooding is
expected along with a 25% exceedance probability that some
main stem rivers may rise above flood stage.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
