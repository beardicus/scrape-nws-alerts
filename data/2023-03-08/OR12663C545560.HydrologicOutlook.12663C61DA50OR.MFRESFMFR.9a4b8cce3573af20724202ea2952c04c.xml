<description>...Flood Potential Outlook for rain and snow melt flooding on
streams in the following county.
...Curry and Coos County in Oregon...
The coming week will be very wet and will be dominated by two
atmospheric river systems that will bring moderate to heavy rain
through the area. The first system will bring 3 to 4 inches of
rain from Thursday through much of Friday. The second system will
roughly double the rain at 5 to 7 inches from Sunday into Tuesday.
The snow level will rise briefly during both atmospheric rivers
which means that there will be rain falling on the low to
mid-elevation snow. This could lead to rapid snow melt causing
small stream flooding, standing water, and the potential for
flooding
along the Coquille River. While the threat of small stream flooding
may be present as both systems pass through the first system has a
lower chance as it may serve more to warm up the snowpack whereas
the second system brings heavier rainfall and will be a bit warmer
and could cause more widespread impacts from standing water and
small stream flooding.
A flood potential outlook is issued when there is the potential
for significant rises or flooding along rivers and streams.
The exact scenario for flooding remains uncertain. This product
will be updated as necessary. Watches and warnings may be issued
by the National Weather Service if this situation worsens.</description>
