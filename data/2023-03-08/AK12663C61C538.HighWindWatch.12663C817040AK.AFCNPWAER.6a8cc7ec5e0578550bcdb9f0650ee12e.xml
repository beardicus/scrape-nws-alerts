<headline>High Wind Watch issued March 08 at 3:46PM AKST until March 10 at 11:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH
FRIDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Northeast winds 35 to 55 mph with gusts up to 80 mph
possible.
* WHERE...Valdez through Thompson Pass.
* WHEN...From late Thursday night through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...High winds could move loose debris, damage property,
and cause power outages. Travel could be difficult, especially
for high profile vehicles.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Gusty outflow winds are expected to
channel through Thompson Pass and into Valdez for much of
Friday. Winds are expected to begin increasing Thursday evening,
peaking from late Friday morning through afternoon. There
remains uncertainty with the timing of peak winds. Blowing snow
may occur if these strong winds resuspend fallen snow, though
visibility reductions are not expected to be widespread.</description>
<instruction>A high wind watch means there is potential for a hazardous high
wind event. Monitor the latest forecasts and warnings for updates
on this situation. Fasten loose objects or shelter objects in a
safe location prior to the onset of winds.</instruction>
