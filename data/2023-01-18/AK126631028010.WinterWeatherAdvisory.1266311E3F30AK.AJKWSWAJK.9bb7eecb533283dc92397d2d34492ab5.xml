<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 18 at 12:16PM AKST until January 19 at 6:00PM AKST by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...FRONTAL PASSAGE THURSDAY IS EXPECTED TO BRING ACCUMULATING
SNOW TO THE HIGHWAYS...
.A front is forecast to pass through the Alaska Panhandle
Thursday. With warmer temps at sea level, a rain and snow mix with
minor accumulations is possible. But with colder weather in place
on the Haines and Klondike Highways, accumulating snow is looking
likely. Some uncertainty is in this forecast due to the southerly
flow, so if the warmer air and rain is able to move northward
faster than expected, then snowfall amounts will be lower. And if
the cold air stays in place longer, higher snow amounts are also
possible.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT TONIGHT TO
6 PM AKST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of up to 5 inches
at higher elevations near Haines Customs and White Pass. Less
than 2 inches expected at sea level.
* WHERE...Klondike and Haines Highway.
* WHEN...From midnight tonight to 6 PM AKST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Heaviest snowfall rates are expected in the
morning.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
Have extra supplies in your vehicle incase of breakdowns or
getting stuck.
