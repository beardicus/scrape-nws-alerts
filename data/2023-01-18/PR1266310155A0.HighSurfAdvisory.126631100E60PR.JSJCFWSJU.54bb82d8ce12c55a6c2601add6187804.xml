<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM AST THURSDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE THURSDAY

* WHAT...Dangerous surf conditions and rip currents expected due
to breaking waves of up to around 8 to 12 feet. Localized
beach erosion and coastal flooding are possible.
* WHERE...Beaches of Culebra, St. Thomas, St. John, and Adjacent
Islands.
* WHEN...For the high risk of rip currents, through late
Thursday night. For the high surf, through 6 AM AST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming conditions. Rip currents can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper
waters. Hazardous breaking waves.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.
A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in
the advisory area, producing localized beach erosion and
dangerous swimming conditions.</instruction>
