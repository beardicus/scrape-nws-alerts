with wave heights of 1 to 3 feet. Small boats, kayaks and
paddle boards will be prone to capsizing and should remain off
lake waters until conditions improve.</description>
<instruction>Even light snowfall causes major travel delays, especially during
periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to
reach your destination. Leave extra space between vehicles since
it takes longer to stop on slick roadways. Have your winter travel
kit ready in your vehicle with food, water, clothing, blankets,
flashlights, chains, etc.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
