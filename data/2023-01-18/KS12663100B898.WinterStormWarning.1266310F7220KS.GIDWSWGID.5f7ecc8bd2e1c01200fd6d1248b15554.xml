<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT CST
TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations mainly 6 to
12 inches. Higher amounts of 13 to 16 inches are possible for
areas northwest of a line from Elwood to Saint Paul to
Fullerton. Winds will average 15 to 25 MPH with highest gusts of
30 to 35 MPH, initially out of the northeast but then turning
northwesterly tonight. This will mainly be a snow event for
areas from the Tri Cities north and west. A narrow swath of ice
accumulations of a tenth to around a quarter of an inch with
lower snowfall amounts of 3 to 7 inches are expected further
southeast from Phillips County Kansas northeastward into
Webster, Clay, and York Counties in Nebraska.
* WHERE...Portions of south central Nebraska and Phillips County
in Kansas.
* WHEN...Until midnight tonight.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. The
hazardous conditions will worsen throughout the day. Lingering
travel impacts into at least Thursday morning are possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The greatest confidence in heavy snowfall
is for areas north and west of the Tri-Cities. Confidence in
snowfall amounts decrease further southeast where snow mixes
with sleet and freezing rain.</description>
