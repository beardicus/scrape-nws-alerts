<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued January 18 at 2:16PM PST until January 23 at 3:00PM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>...KING TIDES WILL CAUSE MINOR COASTAL FLOODING FOR LOW LYING
AREAS THROUGH SUNDAY AFTERNOON...
.The highest astronomical tides of the year, commonly referred to
as the King Tides, continue to impact the coast and Bay shoreline
from January 19th through the 23rd and have historically resulted
in the localized flooding of specific low lying areas each year.
In addition, the lowest low tides of the event will be observed
during the early evening hours which may lead to trouble for
mariners navigating shallow waterways.
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM THURSDAY TO
3 PM PST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Minor coastal flooding expected at prone low lying
coastal locations across the coast and the San Francisco Bay
shoreline during peak high tide from Thursday morning until
Monday afternoon.
* WHERE...San Francisco, Coastal North Bay Including Point Reyes
National Seashore, North Bay Interior Valleys, San Francisco
Bay Shoreline, San Francisco Peninsula Coast, Northern
Monterey Bay and Southern Monterey Bay and Big Sur Coast.
* WHEN...From 6 AM Thursday to 3 PM PST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of areas previously impacted by King Tide
events is expected, including low lying lots, parks, and roads
along the coast and around the San Francisco Bay Shoreline
with the highest high tides. Difficulty navigating shallow bay
waters during the lowest low tides.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Tidal levels will also rise along the
Pacific coast but impacts will be more localized to areas such
as Elkhorn Slough near Moss Landing and the mouth of the
Salinas river at the Salinas Lagoon. Tide poolers and
beachgoers should be familiar with the times and heights of
local tidal levels to avoid hazards that may arise from
rapidly shifting water levels.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Tide poolers should also be aware that there could be occasional
waves running farther up the beach than normal. Do not turn your
back to the ocean.</instruction>
