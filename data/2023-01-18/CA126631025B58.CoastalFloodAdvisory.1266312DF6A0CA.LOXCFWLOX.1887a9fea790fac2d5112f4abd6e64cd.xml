<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued January 18 at 12:22PM PST until January 20 at 10:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST FRIDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding.
For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 8 to 10
feet, highest on west to northwest facing beaches. Dangerous
rip currents expected for most beach areas.
* WHERE...San Luis Obispo County Beaches and Santa Barbara
County Central Coast Beaches.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 10 PM PST Friday.
For the High Surf Advisory, until 10 PM PST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely over vulnerable low-
lying coastal areas such as parking lots, beaches and
walkways. Significant damage to roads or structures is NOT
expected. There is an increased risk of ocean drowning. Rip
currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Large
breaking waves can cause injury, or wash people off beaches
and rocks.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Minor coastal flooding is possible around
the time of morning high tide, causing inundation of sea water
in low lying coastal areas and minor beach erosion. Even higher
tides are forecast for Thursday through Monday with tides 7.4
feet or higher, peaking Friday through Sunday near 7.7 feet
between 8 AM to 930 AM. Coastal flooding is likely to persist
through early next week.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
