<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 18 at 3:25AM CST until January 19 at 12:00AM CST by NWS Hastings</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT CST
TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation. Additional snow accumulations
of 2 to 5 inches and ice accumulations of two tenths to three
tenths of an inch. Winds will average 15 to 25 MPH with highest
gusts of 30 to 35 MPH, initially out of the northeast but then
turning northwesterly Wednesday night. This will end up being
more of an ice event in the Fillmore and Nuckolls County area.
* WHERE...Fillmore and Nuckolls Counties
* WHEN...From midnight Tuesday night to midnight CST Wednesday
night.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult in the warned area due
to the combination of freezing rain and snow. The hazardous
conditions will develop in time to impact the morning commute
and continue through the evening commute. Lingering impacts
into at least Thursday morning are likely.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...While minor forecast adjustments remain
possible, forecast confidence has increased enough that
significant snow accumulation will indeed occur.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
The latest road conditions for the state you are calling from can
be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
