<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT CST
TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation. The greatest winter weather
concern in these counties near the Nebraska/Kansas border will
be freezing rain this morning into early this afternoon. Ice
accumulations around to possibly over one quarter inch will be
possible. Freezing rain will change to snow Wednesday afternoon
or evening before ending. Snow accumulations of 1 to 5 inches
are expected. Winds will average 15 to 25 MPH with highest gusts
of 30 to 35 MPH, initially out of the northeast but then turning
northwesterly tonight.
* WHERE...In Kansas, Smith and Jewell Counties. In Nebraska,
Thayer, Fillmore, and Nuckolls Counties.
* WHEN...Until midnight tonight.
* IMPACTS...The freezing rain may result in downed trees and power
lines along with the possibility for power outages. Travel could
also be very difficult in the warned area due to the combination
of freezing rain and snow. The hazardous conditions will worsen
through the day on Wednesday with lingering impacts into at
least Thursday morning.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Slight changes in the storm track could
greatly impact snowfall and ice accumulations today across these
areas, which are right along the southern edge of this storm
system.</description>
