* IMPACTS...Those with conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and heart
disease will be especially vulnerable to impacts from poor air
quality, as will adults over age 65, young children, and pregnant
women if smoke concentrations become unhealthy.
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to determine
if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method available at
https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.

visibility and to get practical health tips for smoky days.
Individuals can improve indoor air quality during wildfire smoke
events using indoor air cleaners including Do-It-Yourself air
cleaners. Visit Research on DIY Air Cleaners to Reduce Wildfire Smoke
Indoors | US EPA for guidance on how to make Do-It-Yourself air
cleaners.</description>
