<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued April 13 at 2:17PM PDT until April 14 at 11:00PM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 11 PM THIS EVENING TO
11 PM PDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 10 to 18
inches near and west of CA-89 above 7000 feet, with 5-10 inches
below 7000 feet. For areas east of CA-89, 2-6 inches of snow are
expected. Winds gusting as high as 60 mph in the upper portions
of the Sierra.
* WHERE...Greater Lake Tahoe Area.
* WHEN...From 11 PM this evening to 11 PM PDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute. Strong
winds could cause tree damage.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The highest totals will be for the Sierra
crest and western portion of the Tahoe Basin, with much less
snow on the eastern side of the Basin. Gusty winds will bring
rough lake waters to Lake Tahoe with wave heights of 1-3 feet.</description>
<instruction>Even light snowfall causes major travel delays, especially during
periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to
reach your destination. Leave extra space between vehicles since
it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
