<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued April 13 at 2:39PM CDT until April 14 at 8:00PM CDT by NWS Amarillo</headline>
<description>...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM CDT THIS
EVENING FOR STRONG WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY VALUES FOR THE
ENTIRE OKLAHOMA AND TEXAS PANHANDLES...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
THURSDAY EVENING FOR STRONG WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR
THE WESTERN AND CENTRAL OKLAHOMA PANHANDLE AND THE NORTHWEST AND
NORTH CENTRAL TEXAS PANHANDLE...
The National Weather Service in Amarillo has issued a Fire
Weather Watch for strong winds and low relative humidity, which
is in effect from Thursday afternoon through Thursday evening.
* Affected Area...In Oklahoma...Cimarron and Texas. In Texas...
Dallam...Sherman...Hansford...Hartley...Moore and Hutchinson.
* 20 Foot Winds...West 25 to 35 mph with gusts up to 45 mph this
evening. Southwest 15 to 25 mph with gusts to 35 mph Thursday
* Relative Humidity...As low as 7 percent.
* Red Flag Threat Index...2 to 6 this evening. 3 to 5 on Thursday.
* Timing...Critical fire weather conditions until 10 pm.
* Additional Details...The west will certainly be the most
critical, but winds are expected to be slightly lower the
further east. Areas to the north and northeast might miss out
of the critical conditions if a frontal boundary stalls out
over the Panhandles.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now...or will shortly. A combination of
strong winds...low relative humidity...and warm temperatures will
create favorable weather for rapid fire growth and spread. Avoid
activities that promote open flames and sparks.
A Fire Weather Watch means that the potential for critical fire
weather conditions exists. Listen for later forecasts and
possible red flag warnings.</instruction>
