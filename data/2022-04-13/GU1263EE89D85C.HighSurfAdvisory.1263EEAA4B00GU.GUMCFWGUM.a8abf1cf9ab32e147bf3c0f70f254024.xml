to 10 to 12 by Thursday.
* WHERE...West facing reefs of Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan.
* WHEN...Through Friday night.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized
beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water.

<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.

float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
