<headline>Freeze Warning issued October 06 at 3:39AM MDT until October 07 at 8:00AM MDT by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>...WIND ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM MDT EARLY THIS
MORNING...
...FREEZE WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 11 PM THIS EVENING TO
8 AM MDT SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Wind Advisory, northwest winds 15 to 25 mph
with gusts up to 45 mph. For the Freeze Warning, sub-freezing
temperatures as low as 26 expected.
* WHERE...Bennett County and Southern Jackson County. This
includes the Tribal Lands of the Pine Ridge Reservation.
* WHEN...For the Wind Advisory, until 6 AM MDT early this
morning. For the Freeze Warning, from 11 PM this evening to 8
AM MDT Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Sudden wind gusts can cause drivers to lose control,
especially in lightweight or high profile vehicles. Strong winds
can cause blowing dust, reduced visibility, and flying debris.
Frost and freeze conditions will kill crops, other sensitive
vegetation.</description>
<instruction>Use extra caution when driving, especially if operating a high
profile vehicle. Secure outdoor objects.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
