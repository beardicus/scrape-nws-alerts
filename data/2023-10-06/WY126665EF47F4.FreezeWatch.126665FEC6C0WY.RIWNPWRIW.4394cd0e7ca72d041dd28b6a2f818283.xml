<headline>Freeze Watch issued October 06 at 8:45AM MDT until October 07 at 10:00AM MDT by NWS Riverton</headline>
<description>...FREEZE WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH
SATURDAY MORNING...
...FROST ADVISORY IS CANCELLED...
* WHAT...Cloud cover kept temperatures in the middle to upper 30s
for most locations, and temperatures are now warming, so the
Frost Advisory is now cancelled. For the Freeze Watch, sub-
freezing temperatures as low as 28 are possible.
* WHERE...Northeast Johnson County, Southeast Johnson County and
Natrona County Lower Elevations.
* WHEN...From late tonight through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Frost and freeze conditions could kill crops, other
sensitive vegetation and possibly damage unprotected outdoor
plumbing.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Freeze products are issued until a season
ending event occurs, usually as a result of a hard freeze (28
degrees). Should a season ending event occur, a Freeze
Watch/Warning is no longer issued for the season.</description>
<instruction>Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
