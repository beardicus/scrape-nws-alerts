        <headline>Flood Warning issued July 3 at 9:11PM CDT until July 6 at 7:00AM CDT by NWS Midland/Odessa TX</headline>
        <description>...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in Texas...

Rio Grande at Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch near Castolon, Texas
affecting Brewster County.

For the Rio Grande...including Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch near
Castolon,  Texas...Major flooding is forecast.

* WHAT...Major flooding is occurring and major flooding is forecast.

* WHERE...Rio Grande at Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch near Castolon,
Texas.

* WHEN...Until Sunday morning.

* IMPACTS...At 12.0 feet (3.7 meters), the river reaches bankfull,
minor lowland flooding occurs, and no significant damage is
expected.
At 15.0 feet (4.6 meters), flood stage is reached.  Moderate
lowland flooding begins.  Roads that lead to Cottonwood Campground
and River Road may flood.  Stages are practically synonymous with
the gage at Cottonwood Campground at Castolon (CSTT2), and
therefore represent the reach from Santa Elena Canyon through
Cottonwood Campground, where damage may occur.  Cattle also graze
in the lowlands, and may be threatened.
At 19.0 feet (5.8 meters), the river reaches major flood stage.
Flooding begins to occur upstream in Cottonwood Campground at
Castolon, as stages at each location are practically synonymous.
Moderate lowland flooding begins at the gage site, but no damage
occurs.  The gage is inaccessible, as River Road is impassable at
several locations.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 8:15 PM CDT Thursday the stage was 19.3 feet (5.9 meters).
- Bankfull stage is 12.0 feet (3.7 meters).
- Recent Activity...The maximum river stage in the 24 hours
ending at 8:15 PM CDT Thursday was 19.3 feet (5.9 meters).
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise to a crest of 22.3
feet (6.8 meters) tomorrow morning. It will then fall below
flood stage late Sunday morning.
- Flood stage is 15.0 feet (4.6 meters).
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
22.0 feet (6.7 meters) on 06/03/2019.
