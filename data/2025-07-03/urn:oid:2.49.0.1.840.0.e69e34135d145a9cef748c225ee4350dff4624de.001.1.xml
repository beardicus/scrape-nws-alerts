        <instruction>Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.

Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.

Low water crossings will become dangerous in heavy rain. Do not
attempt to cross flooded roads. Find an alternate route.

Remain alert for flooding even in locations not receiving rain.
Arroyos, streams, and rivers can become raging killer currents in a
matter of minutes, even from distant rainfall.

Get out of washes and creeks if you are camping or hiking! Flooding
is occurring or imminent and will inundate creeks and washes.

Report flooding to local law enforcement or NWS Flagstaff on our
Facebook or Twitter pages when you can do so safely.</instruction>
