<description>...STRONG SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS THIS EVENING AND TUESDAY...
Gusty southeasterly winds up to 60 mph will persist through this
evening as a front associated with a strong Bering low moves
through the region. Winds will slowly diminish through the
overnight hours tonight. Winds are expected to be generally light
through Monday as the low passes through the region. Gusty
northwesterly winds are then expected to develop by Monday evening
with gusts of 50 to 65 mph possible through Tuesday evening.
People are urged to secure loose objects that could be blown
around or damaged by the wind.
