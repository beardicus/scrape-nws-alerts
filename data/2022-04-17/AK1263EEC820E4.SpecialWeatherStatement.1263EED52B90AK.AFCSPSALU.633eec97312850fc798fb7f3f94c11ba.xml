<description>...STRONG SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS EARLY SUNDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
SUNDAY EVENING...
Southeasterly winds will quickly increase Sunday morning across
the eastern Aleutians ahead of a front associated with a strong
area of low pressure in the western Bering. Gusty winds of 55 to
70 mph are possible early Sunday afternoon through Sunday evening
as the front moves through the region. Winds will then slowly
diminish through the overnight hours. Winds are expected to be
generally light through Monday as the low passes through the
region. Gusty northwesterly winds are then expected to develop by
early Tuesday morning with gusts of 50 to 65 mph possible through
Tuesday evening.
People are urged to secure loose objects that could be blown
around or damaged by the wind.
