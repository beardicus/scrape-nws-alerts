        <headline>Flood Advisory issued May 12 at 4:18PM EDT until May 13 at 3:15AM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg SC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...Nuisance to Minor flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
expected.

* WHERE...A portion of western North Carolina, including the
following counties, Avery, Burke, Caldwell and McDowell.

* WHEN...Until 315 AM EDT Tuesday.

* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks,
greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and
parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.
A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.  A
small culvert washout or two is possible.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 333 PM EDT, Rounds of light to moderate rainfall continue
to pivot into several watersheds along the northern North
Carolina Blue Ridge Escarpment, including:

Wilson Creek in southeastern Avery and western Caldwell
counties,
North Toe River headwaters in central Avery County near
Newland,
Linville River in southern Avery County and northwestern
Burke County,
North Fork Catawba River in northeastern McDowell County,
Warrior Fork in northwestern Burke County,
and Johns River in western Caldwell County and northern Burke
County.

While short-term rates have not been significant enough to
cause flash-flood concerns, the Advisory area has seen 1.5-3
inches since early Monday morning.  This rainfall is
beginning to produce excessive runoff into the above streams
and associated tributaries.  Over the next several hours,
stream levels are expected to gradually rise and exceed
bankfull levels in several locations, beginning first along
flood-prone areas of Wilson Creek near Edgemont, the upper
reaches of the Linville River near Linville, and the North
Toe River near Newland.  High flows will gradually work
downstream into Johns River later this evening where nuisance
to Minor flooding may develop.

- A period of lighter showers is expected to persist from now
through this evening.  However, rounds of moderate to heavy
showers and a few embedded thunderstorms are possible
generally after 8pm as the best instability moves through the
Advisory area.  These showers and storms may persist for
several hours into the overnight.  Given the saturated soils
and increasing stream flows, resultant runoff from this
activity my be significant enough to produce flash flooding.
Therefore, those in the Advisory area are encouraged to stay
weather aware later tonight as a Flash Flood Warning or two
may be needed should those heavier rainfall rates
materialize.  A Flood Watch for flash flooding remains in
effect through 8am Tuesday.

- Some locations that may experience nuisance flooding
include...
Newland, Blowing Rock, Crossnore, Linville Falls, Jonas
Ridge, Edgemont, Pineola, Ashford, Linville, Globe,
Collettsville and Oak Hill.

        <instruction>In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.

Flooding is developing and may worsen over the next several hours.
It is important to know where you are relative to streams, rivers,
or creeks which can become killers in heavy rains. Campers and
hikers should avoid streams or creeks.</instruction>
