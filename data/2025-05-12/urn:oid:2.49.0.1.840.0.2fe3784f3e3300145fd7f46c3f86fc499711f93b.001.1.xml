        <headline>Air Quality Alert issued May 12 at 11:56PM CDT by NWS Duluth MN</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has issued an Air
Quality Alert for fine particle pollution. The Air Quality Index
(AQI) is expected to reach the Orange or Unhealthy for Sensitive
Groups category.

* WHERE...Portions of northeast Minnesota including northern St.
Louis, central St. Louis, and Inland Lake and Cook counties.
The areas most likely to experience smoke impacts include
Brimson, Isabella, Babbitt, Ely, and portions of the Boundary
Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.

* WHEN...Through 3 PM CDT Tuesday.

* IMPACTS...Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease
(including asthma), heart disease, and children and older
adults, may experience health effects.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The Camp House Fire, Jenkins Creek Fire,
and Munger Shaw Fire are ongoing across northeastern Minnesota.
Crews are responding with full suppression using ground
resources and aircraft. Gusty southerly winds will become more
southeasterly Tuesday. This will transport the smoke plume north
and northeast from the ongoing fires. Smoke will continue to
impact areas near and downwind of the fires. Smoke from these
fires has been observed as far north as the Canadian Border.
</description>
        <instruction>Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including
asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults, should
limit prolonged or heavy exertion.

Follow all safety instructions from local emergency management
officials. Evacuation orders issued for St. Louis County can be
