        <headline>Flood Advisory issued May 12 at 1:27PM EDT until May 12 at 7:15PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg SC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.

* WHERE...A portion of northeast Georgia, including the following
county, Rabun.

* WHEN...Until 715 PM EDT.

* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks,
greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and
parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.
A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.  A
small culvert washout or two is possible.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 119 PM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated training showers and thunderstorms across central
and western Rabun County since about 11:30am.  These heaviest
rainfall has just departed the area and only light rainfall
remains.  However, about 1.25-2.25 inches of rain fell over
the past 90 minutes on top of soils saturated by 1-2 inches
of rainfall from earlier today.  This additional rainfall is
producing excessive runoff across the Advisory area
significant enough to cause isolated areas of nuisance
flooding.  The areas of greatest concern include along Tiger
Creek between Clayton and Lakemont as well as the headwaters
of the Tallulah River including along Persimmon Creek and
other feeder streams.

- No additional heavy rainfall is expected over the next 1-3
hours, however additional bands of heavy showers and storms
may be possible later this afternoon and into the evening.
Additional heavy rainfall may be enough to cause new areas of
flooding to develop.  Please stay weather aware through the
remainder of the day and be prepared to seek higher ground
should flash flooding develop.

- Some locations that may experience isolated nuisance flooding
include...
Clayton, Mountain City, Tiger, Dillard, Sky Valley, and
Lakemont.

        <instruction>Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.

In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
