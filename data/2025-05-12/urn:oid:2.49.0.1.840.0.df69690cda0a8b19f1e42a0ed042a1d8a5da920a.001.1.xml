        <headline>Flood Advisory issued May 12 at 5:25PM EDT until May 12 at 11:15PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg SC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.

* WHERE...Southwestern Hart County and central and western Elbert
County in northeastern Georgia.

* WHEN...Until 1115 PM EDT Monday.

* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks,
greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and
parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.
A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.  A
small culvert washout or two is possible.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 511 PM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated a new round of heavy rainfall from thunderstorms is
developing over Deep Creek and Beaverdam Creeks near Dewy
Rose, Sweet City, and Bowman in western Elbert County.
Additional thunderstorms capable of torrential rainfall are
moving into Elbert County from the south and will impact
southwestern Hart County over the next 60 minutes.  The
resultant heavy rainfall is occurring over saturated soils
from earlier rainfall which produced 1.5-2.5 inches of rain
across the Advisory area.  Excessive runoff is ongoing,
resulting in rapid rises along area streams, including Deep
Creek, Dove Creek, and Beaverdam Creek.  It is likely that
these and adjacent streams will approach and exceed bankfull
conditions, resulting in nuisance to Minor flooding of
adjacent low-lying areas.  Flood-prone areas and roadways,
including Horse Farm Rd, Brickyard Rd, and Winns Mill Rd, are
likely to be impacted over the next 2-3 hours, as well as
property adjacent to Beaverdam Creek along Brewers Bridge Rd.

- A Flash Flood Warning may be needed for this area if heavy
rainfall persists over the next 60 minutes.  Individuals
within the Advisory area are urged to stay weather aware,
avoid all low-lying areas adjacent to streams, and be
prepared to seek higher ground should flash-flooding develop.

- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Elberton, Royston, Bowman, Canon, Middleton, Dewy Rose, Sweet
City, Vanna and Fortsonia.
