        <description>A broad tropical disturbance, being monitored as Invest 92W, is
slowly moving through western Micronesia and towards Palau and Yap
and is located near 9N141E. Today's satellite scatterometer data and
visible satellite imagery does not show a well-defined circulation,
but an elongated area of cyclonic (counter-clockwise) turning, that
is generating locally heavy showers, potentially with some gusty
winds. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center rates 92W as a "sub-low" for
development, which means significant development into a tropical
cyclone is unlikely over the next 24 hours. Mult-model consensus does
support a gradual development of 92W later this week, but the
overall trend supports development as 92W is west of Palau and Yap,
and is moving west-northwest into the Philippine Sea.

This slow and disorganized development will lead to widespread
variability in conditions across Palau and Yap State, however, the
potential for locally heavy showers, gusty winds, and choppy seas
exists across the region. Model ensembles show the potential for 3 to
6 inches across the region through Friday, but the location of the
heavier rainfall will depend on where the locally heavy showers
setup. At this time, landslides are unlikely, due to the high
variability in rainfall potential. However, if soils become
saturated by heavy rain, this potential will increase with the onset
of additional rainfall. Also, northwest to north swells generated by
distant Typhoons Ragasa and Neoguri will be increasing surf along
west and north facing reefs of Palau and Yap over the next few days,
leading to elevated surf along west and north facing reefs. Current
wave model projections keep surf below hazardous levels of 9 feet,
but this forecast will be closely monitored for any changes. As 92W
moves west of Palau and Yap, there is the potential for a monsoon-
like pattern to develop as 92W organizes, prolonging elevated seas
and surf along the western sides of the islands and impacting areas
sensitive to southwest to westerly winds and swells.

Residents and mariners should monitor the latest forecasts for the
region at weather.gov/gum/PublicForecasts and any information shared
by WSO Palau and WSO Yap for their local regions.
