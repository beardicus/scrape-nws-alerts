<description>...HEAVY RAINFALL POSSIBLE OVER THE WEEKEND...
Tropical Storm Malakas, centered near 6N146E is moving toward the
north-northwest. It is expected to turn northwestward, passing to
the east of Fais and Ulithi in Yap State over the next few days.
Latest model guidance is in better agreement over the expected
movement and development of Malakas through Monday morning, then the
models diverge. The GFS turns toward the northeast while the ECMWF
pushes the system more north-northwestward. The GFS solution would
bring heavier rainfall to the Marianas, with up to 10 inches
indicated through Monday. Based on current forecast movement,
rainfall amounts between 3 and 6 inches remain a possibility through
Monday evening.
Localized flooding is possible in low-lying and poor drainage areas,
while flash flooding will be possible in areas of heaviest rainfall,
especially near steep terrain. Residents of the Marianas need to
closely monitor this developing situation as watches, advisories and
warnings could be issued later in the week. If living near streams
and rivers, prepare to move items away from stream and river banks.
Make sure storm drains nearby are not clogged, especially in
low-lying areas.
This outlook will not updated. If necessary, a Flash Flood Watch may
be issued Saturday or Saturday night.</description>
