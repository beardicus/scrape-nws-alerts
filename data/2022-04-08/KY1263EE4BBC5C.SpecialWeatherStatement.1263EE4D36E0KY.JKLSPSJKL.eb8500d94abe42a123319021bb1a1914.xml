<description>...Wintery Weather and High Elevation Snow Will Take Us Into The
Weekend...
A strong and unseasonably cold storm system will affect the area
through the first part of the weekend. Any rain showers which
persist into the overnight will gradually mix with or change to
snow showers. The vast majority of the area will remain above
freezing overnight, and will not experience anything more than a
temporary dusting of wet snow. However, the highest elevations
at and above 2,500 feet, should experience some light snow
accumulations which persist. From tonight through Saturday
evening, the crest of Pine Mountain along the Little Shepherd
Trail and Black Mountain could receive between 1 and 3 inches of
snow. Slippery travel could occur at times on KY 160 between Lynch
and the VA border.
The precipitation should taper off Saturday evening, and skies
will then clear Saturday night. This will set us up for temperatures
near or below freezing by dawn on Sunday. Most places can expect
frost at a minimum, and the possibility of temperatures dipping
below 30 degrees.</description>
