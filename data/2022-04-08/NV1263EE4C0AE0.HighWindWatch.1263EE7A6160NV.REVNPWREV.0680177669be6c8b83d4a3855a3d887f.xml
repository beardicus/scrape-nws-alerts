<headline>High Wind Watch issued April 08 at 7:32PM PDT until April 11 at 11:00PM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WATCH IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH MONDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...West-southwest winds 25 to 40 mph with gusts up to 70 mph
possible, especially in wind-prone areas including Highway 95
near Walker Lake.
* WHERE...Mineral and Southern Lyon Counties.
* WHEN...From Monday afternoon through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...Damaging winds could blow down trees and power lines.
Widespread power outages are possible. Travel could be
difficult, especially for high profile vehicles. Blowing dust
may reduce visibility downwind of dry lake beds and sinks.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...North to south oriented highways will
experience the strongest crosswinds. Areas of blowing dust will
be possible. Gusty winds and dry conditions may result in a
period of localized critical fire conditions, so avoid
activities that may spark a fire.</description>
<instruction>Now is the time to secure loose outdoor items such as patio
furniture, holiday decorations, and trash cans before winds
increase which could blow these items away. The best thing to do
is prepare ahead of time by making sure you have extra food and
water on hand, flashlights with spare batteries and/or candles in
the event of a power outage.</instruction>
