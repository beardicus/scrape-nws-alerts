<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued April 08 at 6:46AM CDT until April 10 at 9:00PM CDT by NWS El Paso</headline>
<description>...FIRE WEATHER WATCH FOR SUNDAY DUE TO STRONG WINDS, VERY LOW
HUMIDITY, WARMER THAN NORMAL TEMPERATURES, AND DEEP INSTABILITY...
.Broad, large-scale, troughing across the western U.S. will bring
deep and dry southwesterly flow across southern New Mexico and Far
west Texas Saturday through early next week. As winds aloft
increase and surface low pressure develops to our east, winds
across the region will become breezy to windy and gusty on Sunday.
Weak high pressure over the area today and Saturday will dry out
fuels ahead of these windy conditions, with warm temperatures and
single-digit relative humidity with almost no overnight recovery.
In addition, the atmosphere will be deeply unstable with mixing
depths above 10,000 ft and transport winds of 30 to 40 mph
helping to provide strong ventilation for any fires that do
ignite. Fire weather conditions will further deteriorate and
become Critical for Monday and Tuesday as winds grow stronger with
the trough`s arrival and passage.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
SUNDAY EVENING FOR DRY, WINDY, WARM, AND UNSTABLE CONDITIONS FOR
FIRE WEATHER ZONES 055, 056, 110, 111, 112, AND 113...

issued a Fire Weather Watch, which is in effect from Sunday

* AFFECTED AREA AND TIMING...All of southwest and south central
New Mexico, as well as El Paso and Hudspeth counties in Far West

30 mph by early afternoon with gusts of 35 to 45 mph after mid
