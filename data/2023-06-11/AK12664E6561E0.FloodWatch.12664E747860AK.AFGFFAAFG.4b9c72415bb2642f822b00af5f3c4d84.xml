<headline>Flood Watch issued June 11 at 3:12PM AKDT  by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE TUESDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Rivers draining the Brooks Range in the Upper Koyukuk
Valley.
* WHEN...Through late Tuesday night.
* IMPACTS...Runoff from rainfall and remaining snowmelt has caused
rivers draining from the southeastern Brooks Range to rise to near
bankfull in many locations, with water over banks in some low
lying areas. River levels will continue to rise in Allakaket and
Hughes through tomorrow.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Heavy rain has fallen on existing snowpack leading to
increased runoff. Flows in rivers may increase quickly
covering gravel bars. An increased amount of debris will flow
down rivers. Minor flooding is possible in Hughes and
Allakaket.

Those living or recreating along rivers draining the Brooks Range are
encouraged to monitor river levels this weekend.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
