<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued June 11 at 6:49PM PDT until June 12 at 12:45AM PDT by NWS Sacramento</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Sacramento has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
Northeastern Butte County in northern California...
Plumas County in northern California...
* Until 1245 AM PDT.
* At 649 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing
heavy rain across highway 89 and 70 from Crescent Mills to Twain
and Belden. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin
shortly. Debris flows and rock slides will also be possible, as
the heavy rain is falling in portions of the North Complex and
Dixie fire burn scars.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms. Debris flows
and Rock slides.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban
areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as
other poor drainage and low-lying areas.  Debris flows
and Rock slides.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Pulga, Quincy, East Quincy, Bald Eagle Mountain, Tobin, Belden,
Storrie, Bucks Lake, Caribou, Meadow Valley, Twain, Seneca,
Paxton, Stirling City, Indian Falls, Keddie, Concow, Crescent
Mills and Greenville.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry areas is likely. The heavy rains will
likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.</instruction>
