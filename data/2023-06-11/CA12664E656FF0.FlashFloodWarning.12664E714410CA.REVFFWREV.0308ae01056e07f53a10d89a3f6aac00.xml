<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued June 11 at 4:48PM PDT until June 11 at 6:00PM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Reno has extended the
* Flash Flood Warning for...
Alpine County in northern California...
* Until 600 PM PDT.
* At 448 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing
heavy rain across the warned area. Up to 1 inch of rain has
fallen. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through the Tamarack burn scar. The debris flow can consist
of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban
areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as
other poor drainage and low-lying areas.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Grover Hot Springs, Markleeville and Turtle Rock Campground.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>A Flash Flood Warning for a recent burn area means that flooding
and/or debris flows are imminent or occurring. Residents living in
or immediately downstream should take immediate precautions to
protect life. Quickly move away from the burn area only if it is
safe to do so, otherwise shelter in place and move to a second story
or the highest location in your home to stay out of the path of
fast-moving water and debris flows.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
