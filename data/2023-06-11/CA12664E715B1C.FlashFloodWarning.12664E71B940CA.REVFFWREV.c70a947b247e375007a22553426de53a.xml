<instruction>A Flash Flood Warning for a recent burn area means that flooding
and/or debris flows are imminent or occurring. Residents living in
or immediately downstream should take immediate precautions to
protect life. Quickly move away from the burn area only if it is
safe to do so, otherwise shelter in place and move to a second story
or the highest location in your home to stay out of the path of
fast-moving water and debris flows.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.</instruction>
