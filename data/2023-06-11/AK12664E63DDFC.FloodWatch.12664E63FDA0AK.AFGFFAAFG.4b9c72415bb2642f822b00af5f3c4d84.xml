<headline>Flood Watch issued June 11 at 5:19AM AKDT  by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Rivers draining the Brooks Range in the Upper Koyukuk
Valley.
* WHEN...Through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Runoff from rainfall and remaining snowmelt has caused
rivers draining the southeastern Brooks Range to rise to near
bankfull in many locations, with water over bank in some low lying
areas. Water from the Koyukuk will cover the old runway along the
river in Allakaket. The Koyukuk is not expected to flood in
Bettles, but will likely reach bankfull. Water levels will
continue to rise into the weekend, possibly causing minor flooding
in other locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Heavy rain has fallen on existing snowpack leading to
increased runoff. Flows in rivers may increase quickly
covering gravel bars. An increased amount of debris will flow
down rivers.

Those living or recreating along rivers draining the Brooks Range are
encouraged to monitor river levels this weekend.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
