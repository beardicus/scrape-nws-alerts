        <headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued October 15 at 3:35AM EDT until October 15 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City NC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to 1 to 2 feet of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking
waves of 6 to 9 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards
Statement, dangerous rip currents and large breaking waves
expected in the surf zone.

* WHERE...Hatteras Island.

* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 8 PM EDT Friday.
For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT this evening. For
the Beach Hazards Statement, from 8 AM EDT this morning
through this evening.

* IMPACTS...Up to 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in a low threat of property damage. Some roads and
low lying property including parking lots, parks, lawns, and
homes adjacent to the waterfront will experience shallow
flooding. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore
break can throw a swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom
causing neck and back injuries.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The combination of gusty onshore winds,
high astronomical tides, wave run up, and already battered and
weakened dune and other oceanside structures will bring the
potential of additional impacts to Hatteras Island, mostly north
of Cape Hatteras, around the time of high tide through Thursday.
Additionally, minor soundside flooding is expected to continue
into Friday.

        <instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.

Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.

Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.

Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
