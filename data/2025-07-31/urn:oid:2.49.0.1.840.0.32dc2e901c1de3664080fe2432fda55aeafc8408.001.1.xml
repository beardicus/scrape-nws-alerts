AIR QUALITY INDEX...Moderate to Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups

ADDITIONAL DETAILS...

An alert for possible Moderate (Air Quality Index
yellow category) to Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups air quality
(Air Quality Index orange category) due to smoke has been issued
for the following Nebraska counties: Adams, Antelope, Boone, Boyd,
Buffalo, Burt, Butler, Cass, Cedar, Clay, Cuming, Colfax, Cuming,
Dakota, Dixon, Dodge, Douglas, Fillmore, Franklin, Gage, Garfield,
Greeley, Hamilton, Holt, Howard, Jefferson, Johnson, Kearney,

Seward, Sherman, Stanton, Thayer, Thurston, Valley, Washington,

During Moderate (AQI yellow category) conditions, those who are
unusually sensitive to particle pollution should consider reducing
prolonged or heavy exertion.

Prescribed burning is being conducted in the region for the
management of prairie and rangelands, and smoke may affect the air
quality in Nebraska.

Smoke levels and wind directions are monitored by Nebraska and
other states to predict when impacts to the air quality may occur.
Air Quality alerts for smoke are issued for affected areas by the
Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services and Department of
Water, Energy, and Environment and posted on agency webpages and
social media sites.  By notifying the media and local health
departments, alerts help citizens protect their health by
informing them of days where outdoor activities should be reduced
or avoided to minimize exposure to smoke.

Alerts are based on data available from weather forecasts, smoke
plume modeling, satellite imagery, and from air quality monitors
located in Omaha, Bellevue, Lincoln, Beatrice, Grand Island, and
Scottsbluff.
