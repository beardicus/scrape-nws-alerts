<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued October 15 at 4:15PM AKDT until October 16 at 2:00PM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 PM AKDT
MONDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow accumulations of
up to 4 inches and ice accumulations up to two tenths of an
inch. Highest snow accumulations expected west of Sleetmute.
Highest ice accumulations expected along the Kuskokwim Mountains
east of Crooked Creek and south of Stony River.
* WHERE...Lower Kuskokwim Valley.
* WHEN...Until 2 PM AKDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on difficult travel conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Forecast precipitation amounts have
increased since the previous update, leading to the potential
for greater snow and ice accumulations overnight. Otherwise, we
continue to expect the highest chances of freezing rain from
Crooked Creek east and north of Koliganek, between the Kuskokwim
Mountains and Western Alaska Range. Crooked Creek will mark the
approximate transition zone in precipitation type, with areas
to its west more likely to see snow and areas to its east more
likely to see freezing rain/ice.</description>
