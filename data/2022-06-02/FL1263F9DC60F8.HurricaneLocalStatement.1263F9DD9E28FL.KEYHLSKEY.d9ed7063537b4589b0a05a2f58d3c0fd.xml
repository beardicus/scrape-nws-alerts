SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
At 1100 PM, the disturbance was centered near latitude 21.8 North,
longitude 87.4 West. The system is moving toward the north near 6 mph.
A turn toward the northeast is expected tonight, and a faster motion
toward the northeast is expected Friday and Saturday. This system will
continue to move closer to the Florida Keys through tonight and
tomorrow. Weather conditions will gradually deteriorate with and
thundery squalls becoming more frequent.
A Tropical Storm Warning is now in effect for all Florida Keys and
surrounding waters.
There is a potential risk for multiple hazards for the Florida Keys,
including flooding rainfall, tropical storm force winds, especially in
squalls, isolated tornadoes, and treacherous marine conditions.
Heavy rainfall of 4 to 8 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 10
inches, may cause significant rainwater flooding. A Flood Watch is in
effect from midnight tonight through Saturday evening.
A few tornadoes will be possible Friday through Saturday.
There is potential for minor coastal flooding of 1 to 2 feet above mean
sea level along the Gulfside/Bayside Saturday, especially over the on
the bayside communities in the Upper Keys. Significant oceanside wave
overwash is expected Friday through Saturday, most evident around the
times of higher high tide.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across the Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.
Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with
underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.
Many road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across the
Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
the Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
* SURGE:
Potential for minor coastal flooding of 1 to 2 feet above mean sea
level along the Gulfside/Bayside Saturday, especially over the
bayside communities along the far Upper Keys (including Key Largo).
Significant oceanside wave overwash is expected Friday through
Saturday, most evident around the times of higher high tide
(especially late morning through mid afternoon).
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of roads and parking lots inundated by surge water.
Driving conditions dangerous in places where surge water covers
the road.
- Moderate beach erosion.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
No mandatory evacuations are in effect expected for this storm.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
in a low-lying or poor drainage area, plan to move to safe shelter on
higher ground.
If a Tornado Warning is issued for your area, be ready to shelter
quickly, preferably away from windows and in an interior room not prone
to flooding. If driving, scan the roadside for quick shelter options.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
