<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM MDT FRIDAY...
The New Mexico Departments of Health and Environment has issued an
Air Quality Alert, until 1 PM MDT Friday.
An Air Quality Alert for Smoke has been issued.
* WHAT... Localized areas of unhealthy air quality will continue for
areas near the black fire in the Gila National Forest. Outflow
winds from afternoon or evening shower/thunderstorm activity just
east of the Black fire may push smoke further west and southwest
into areas near the Gila Cliff Dwellings, Mimbres Valley and
vicinity of Kingston and Hillsboro. Outside the immediate Black
fire area, smoke impacts from other large fires in the state are
not expected to be either widespread or significant.
* WHERE... Significant impacts will be focused across western
Socorro, Catron, northeast Grant, and far western Sierra counties.
More details on impacted locations and latest air quality
information can be found at https://fire.airnow.gov.
* WHEN... Now through at least 1PM MDT Friday, June 3.</description>
