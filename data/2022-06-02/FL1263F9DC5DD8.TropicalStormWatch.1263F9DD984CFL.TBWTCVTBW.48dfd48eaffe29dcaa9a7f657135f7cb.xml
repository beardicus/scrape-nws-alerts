urban or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving
conditions on bridges and other elevated roadways.

creeks, canals, and ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken
foundations. Several places may experience expanded areas
of rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and
