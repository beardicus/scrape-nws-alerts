SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
At 500 PM EDT, Potential Tropical Cyclone One is currently near the
Yucatan Peninsula and is tracking northeastward towards the
southeastern Gulf of Mexico. This system is forecast to move closer to
the Florida Keys starting tomorrow, with weather conditions beginning
to deteriorate by early Friday morning and thundery squalls
becoming more frequent.
There is a potential risk for multiple hazards for the Florida Keys,
including flooding rainfall, tropical storm force winds, especially in
squalls, isolated tornadoes, and treacherous marine conditions.
Heavy rainfall of 4 to 8 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 10
inches, may cause significant rainwater flooding. A Flood Watch is in
effect from midnight tonight through Saturday evening.
A few tornadoes will be possible Friday through Saturday.
There is potential for minor coastal flooding of 1 to 2 feet above mean
sea level along the Gulfside/Bayside Saturday, especially over the on
the bayside communities in the Upper Keys. Significant oceanside wave
overwash is expected Friday through Saturday, most evident around the
times of higher high tide.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across the
Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* SURGE:
Potential for minor coastal flooding of 1 to 2 feet above mean sea
level along the Gulfside/Bayside Saturday, especially over the bayside
communities along the far Upper Keys (including Key Largo). Significant
oceanside wave overwash is expected Friday through Saturday, most
evident around the times of higher high tide (especially late morning
through mid afternoon).
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across the Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.
Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with
underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.
Many road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
the Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
No mandatory evacuations are expected for this storm.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies
kit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your
home or business.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
in a low-lying or poor drainage area, plan to move to safe shelter on
higher ground.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes
to the forecast.
There is a threat from tornadoes with this storm. Have multiple ways
to receive Tornado Warnings. Be ready to shelter quickly.
