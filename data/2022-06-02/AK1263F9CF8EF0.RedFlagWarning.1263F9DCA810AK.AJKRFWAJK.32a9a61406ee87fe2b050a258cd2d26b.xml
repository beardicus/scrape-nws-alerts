<headline>Red Flag Warning issued June 02 at 11:16AM AKDT until June 02 at 9:00PM AKDT by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM AKDT THIS EVENING
FOR HIGH TEMPERATURES, LOW HUMIDITY, AND BREEZY CONDITIONS
FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONE 018...
The National Weather Service in Juneau has issued a Red Flag
Warning, which is in effect until 9 PM AKDT this evening.
* AFFECTED AREA...Fire weather zone 018.
* WIND...May reach speeds up to 15 mph.
* HUMIDITY...Relative humidity will fall into the low 20s or upper
teens with temperatures in the mid 70s and 80s on Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly.
Outdoor burning is not recommended.
A warning means that severe fire weather conditions are already
occurring or imminent in the warning area. Temperatures will warm
rapidly through the early afternoon. Breezy conditions will aid
steep reductions in relative humidity as well which will enhance
the spread of any uncontained fires should they develop.
Confidence is high that red flag conditions will develop by mid-
day. These conditions may persist through Friday and an extension
to this red flag warning may become necessary.
Please advise the appropriate officials and fire crews in the
field of this red flag warning.
This statement will be updated by 9 PM AKDT Thursday or sooner if
conditions warrant.
