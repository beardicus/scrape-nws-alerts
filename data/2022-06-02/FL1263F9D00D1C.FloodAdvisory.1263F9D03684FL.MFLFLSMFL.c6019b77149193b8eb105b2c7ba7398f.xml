* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...A portion of South Florida, including the following

* WHEN...Until 745 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 636 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicated that the rains have
ended in the Advisory area. However, rainfall amounts of 2 to
4 inches with up to 6 inches in the Weston area have fallen
from from the previous showers and thunderstorms. This amount
of rainfall will take some time to drain away due to the
grounds being already saturated from previous storm the last
couple of days. Therefore, the Flood Advisory will remain in
effect until 745 PM EDT this evening.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Pembroke Pines, Hollywood, Coral Springs, Davie, Plantation,
Sunrise, Tamarac, Margate, Lauderhill, Weston, North
Lauderdale, Cooper City, Sawgrass Mills Mall, Pine Island
Ridge, Intersection I-75 And Griffin Road, Sunshine Acres,
