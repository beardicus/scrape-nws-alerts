SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Potential Tropical Cyclone One, located near the northern tip of the
Yucatan Peninsula, continues to move slowly northward late this
evening. The developing system is forecast to turn northeast and
become a Tropical Depression late tonight or Friday morning.
The system is then expected to become a Tropical Storm and continue
to move northeast at a faster forward speed across the southeast
Gulf of Mexico. The system is forecast to move northeast across the
southern half of the Florida peninsula Saturday into Saturday
evening.
The primary hazard for east central Florida at this time is the
potential for flooding rainfall with this system as it draws closer
to the area. Rainfall totals may reach 4 to 6 inches across portions
of Okeechobee county and the Treasure Coast Friday night through
Saturday night. Any deviations in the track toward central Florida
or a slower motion would elevate the heavy rainfall further north
across the area.
As the system moves toward the southern Florida peninsula Saturday
into Saturday night the frequency of showers and squalls will
increase with the potential for gusts to tropical storm strength in
heavier squalls near where the center tracks across the state and in
any stronger outer rainbands. The strongest winds are expected to
occur late Saturday into Saturday night on the current forecast
track.
With the current forecast track and intensity of the system, storm
surge is not expected for east central Florida. However, a few
tornadoes cannot be ruled out across the area.
Residents and visitors should stay tuned to the latest forecasts and
information regarding Potential Tropical Cyclone One as we head
through the upcoming weekend.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
East Central Florida. Potential impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant
impacts across Okeechobee and the Treasure Coast counties. Potential
impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals, and
ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
Prepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having limited
impacts possible across Brevard and Osceola counties.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts mainly
south of Orlando. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
Elsewhere across East Central Florida, little to no impact is
anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local officials for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
near the ocean or a large inland lake, in a low-lying or poor
drainage area, in a valley, or near an already swollen river, plan to
move to safe shelter on higher ground.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes
to the forecast.
