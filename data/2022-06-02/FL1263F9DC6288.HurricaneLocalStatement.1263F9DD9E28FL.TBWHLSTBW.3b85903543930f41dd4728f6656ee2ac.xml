- The Tropical Storm Watch has been upgraded to a Tropical Storm
Warning for Coastal Charlotte and Coastal Lee
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Coastal Charlotte and
Coastal Lee
- A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Coastal Sarasota,
DeSoto, Hardee, Highlands, Inland Charlotte, Inland Lee, Inland
Manatee, Inland Sarasota, and Polk
* STORM INFORMATION:

southwest of Sarasota FL
- 21.8N 87.4W
- Storm Intensity 35 mph
- Movement North or 360 degrees at 6 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Potential Tropical Cyclone One, centered northeastern part of the
Yucatan Peninsula, is expected to continue to move north at about
5 mph through tonight. Then, it should turn toward the northeast on
Friday and Saturday. The system should move across the southeastern
Gulf of Mexico through Friday night, and then move across the southern
and central portions of the Florida Peninsula on Saturday.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant
impacts across Southwest and parts of West-central Florida. Potential
impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals, and
ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
Protect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across Southwest and parts of West-central Florida.
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
Southwest and parts of West-central Florida. Potential impacts in this
area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across West Central and Southwest Florida, little to no
impact is anticipated.
* SURGE:
Protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited impacts
across Southwest and parts of West-central Florida. Potential impacts
in this area include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread
with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where
surge water covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
Elsewhere across West Central and Southwest Florida, little to no
impact is anticipated.
* TORNADOES:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time across West Central
and Southwest Florida.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
If you are relocating to safe shelter, leave as early as possible.
Allow extra time to reach your destination. Many roads and bridges
will be closed once strong winds arrive. Check the latest weather
forecast before departing and drive with caution.
If heading to a community shelter, become familiar with the shelter
rules before arrival, especially if you have special needs or have
pets. Take essential items with you from your Emergency Supplies Kit.
Keep cell phones well charged. Cell phone chargers for automobiles
can be helpful, but be aware of your risk for deadly carbon monoxide
poisoning if your car is left idling in a garage or other poorly
ventilated area.
It is important to remain calm, informed, and focused during an
emergency. Be patient and helpful with those you encounter.
If you are a visitor, be sure to know the name of the city or town in
which you are staying and the name of the county or parish in which
it resides. Listen for these locations in local news updates. Pay
attention for instructions from local authorities.
Rapidly rising flood waters are deadly. If you are in a flood-prone
area, consider moving to higher ground. Never drive through a flooded
roadway. Remember, turn around don`t drown!
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
