<description>...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM AKDT THIS
EVENING FOR HIGH TEMPERATURES, LOW HUMIDITY, AND BREEZY CONDITIONS
FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONE 019...
* AFFECTED AREA...Fire weather zone 019.
* WIND...Up to 15 mph.
* HUMIDITY...As low as 14 percent with temperatures in the mid
80s on Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Any fires that develop could spread rapidly.
Outdoor burning is not recommended.</description>
<instruction>A warning means that severe fire weather conditions are already
occurring or imminent in the warning area. Temperatures will warm
rapidly through the morning. Breezy conditions will aid steep
drops in humidity as well which will all enhance spread should
fire develop. Confidence is high that red flag conditions develop
by mid-day. These conditions may persist through Friday and an
extension to this red flag warning may become necessary.
Please advise the appropriate officials and fire crews in the
field of this red flag warning.
This statement will be updated by 9 PM AKDT Thursday or sooner if
conditions warrant.</instruction>
