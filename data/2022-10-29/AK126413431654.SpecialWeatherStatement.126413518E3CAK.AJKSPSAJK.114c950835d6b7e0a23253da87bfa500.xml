<description>...STRONG WINDS POSSIBLE SUNDAY...
A wave of low pressure will develop over the Gulf late tonight and
track up into the central or southern Panhandle Sunday. Along and
south of the track of this low, enhanced southwest wind gusts are
likely. At this time there is high uncertainty in regards to the
exact track of this low, however wind gusts of up to 50 mph from
the southwest will affect some coastal communities from Sitka
southward to the west coast of Prince of Wales Island during the
day Sunday. As the track and strength of this system becomes more
clear, there is the potential for high wind warnings to be posted
tonight into Sunday for some portion of the central and southern
Gulf coast. Places that are more exposed to southwest wind should
make preparations for a period of strong wind gusts Sunday.</description>
