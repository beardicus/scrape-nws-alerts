<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM EST MONDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM EST
MONDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to 1 to 2 feet of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking
waves of 6 to 8 feet expected in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Northern Outer Banks and Hatteras Island.
* WHEN...Until 10 AM EST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Minor oceanside flooding possible tonight into Monday
morning due to long period swell arriving from a coastal storm
well offshore. Up to 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground
level is possible in low- lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways resulting in a low threat of property damage. Some
roads and low lying property including parking lots, parks,
lawns, and homes adjacent to the waterfront may experience
shallow flooding. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Localized minor ocean overwash
possible, north of Cape Hatteras, for areas where dune
structures are vulnerable.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
