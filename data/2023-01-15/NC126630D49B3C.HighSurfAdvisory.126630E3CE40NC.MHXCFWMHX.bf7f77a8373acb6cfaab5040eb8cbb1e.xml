<headline>High Surf Advisory issued January 15 at 3:39PM EST until January 16 at 3:00PM EST by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 PM EST MONDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 PM EST MONDAY NORTH OF
CAPE HATTERAS...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to 1 to 2 feet of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking
waves of 6 to 9 feet expected in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Northern Outer Banks and Hatteras Island.
* WHEN...Until 3 PM EST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Minor oceanside flooding and localized minor ocean
overwash possible into Monday due to wave run up from low
pressure well offshore. Up to 1 to 2 feet of inundation above
ground level is possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and
tidal waterways resulting in a low threat of property damage.
Some roads and low lying property including parking lots, parks,
lawns, and homes adjacent to the waterfront may experience
shallow flooding. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Localized ocean overwash possible north
of Cape Hatteras, for areas where dune structures are
vulnerable, mainly around times of high tide. High tide is
around 2 AM Monday morning and 2 PM Monday afternoon.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.</instruction>
