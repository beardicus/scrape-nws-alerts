<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued January 15 at 8:09PM PST until January 17 at 10:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST
TUESDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST TUESDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding.
For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 8 to 14
feet with dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...West facing San Luis Obispo County Beaches and Santa
Barbara County Central Coast Beaches.
* WHEN...Until 10 PM PST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely, around the time of
high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as
parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to
roads or structures is NOT expected. There is an increased
risk for ocean drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers and
surfers out to sea. Large breaking waves can cause injury,
wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats
near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Minor coastal flooding is possible around
the time of high tide, causing inundation of sea water in low
lying coastal areas and minor beach erosion. High tides will be
5.9 feet at 438 AM on Monday and 6.4 feet at 523 AM on Tuesday.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
