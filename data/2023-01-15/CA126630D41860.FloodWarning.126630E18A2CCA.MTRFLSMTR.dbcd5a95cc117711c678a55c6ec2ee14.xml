<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads.
Most flood related deaths occur in automobiles. Do not attempt to
cross water covered bridges, dips, or low water crossings. Never try
to cross a flowing stream, even a small one, on foot. To escape
rising water find another route over higher ground.
Motorists should not attempt to drive around barricades or drive
cars through flooded areas.
Caution is urged when walking near riverbanks.
Even 6 inches of fast-moving flood water can knock you off your feet
and a depth of 2 feet will float your car. Never try to walk, swim,
or drive through such swift water. If you come upon flood waters,
stop, turn around and go another way.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
The next statement will be issued this evening at 400 PM PST.</instruction>
