<headline>Rip Current Statement issued November 20 at 4:31PM AST until November 23 at 6:00PM AST by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY MORNING THROUGH
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Dangerous surf conditions and rip currents expected due
to breaking waves around 6 feet.
* WHERE...Beaches of eastern St. Croix.
* WHEN...From Monday morning through Wednesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions along with
localized minor coastal flooding and beach erosion. Strong
currents that can carry even the best swimmers away from shore
and out to sea.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.</instruction>
