through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding is expected, with water reaching
or pushing into the dunes on South Padre Island. Vehicles,
except those with four wheel drive and high wheel bases, will
be unable to be driven on the beach. This includes locations
north of Public Beach Access #3. Minor to moderate beach
erosion is expected. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions
and localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the
best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
