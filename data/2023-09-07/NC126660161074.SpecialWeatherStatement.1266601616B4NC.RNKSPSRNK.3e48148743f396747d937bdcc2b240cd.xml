<description>...A STRONG THUNDERSTORM WILL IMPACT NORTH CENTRAL STOKES AND
SOUTHEASTERN PATRICK COUNTIES THROUGH 1045 PM EDT...
At 1029 PM EDT, Doppler radar was tracking a strong thunderstorm near
Danbury, moving north at 20 mph.
HAZARD...Wind gusts up to 40 mph and pea size hail.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around
unsecured objects. Minor hail damage to vegetation is
possible.
This storm will remain over mainly rural areas of
north central Stokes and southeastern Patrick Counties.
MAX HAIL SIZE...0.25 IN
MAX WIND GUST...40 MPH</description>
<instruction>If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.
Locally heavy rain will quickly reduce visibility and result in
ponding of water on roadways, standing water in low lying areas, and
minor flooding of creeks, streams, and areas of poor drainage.
Drivers are urged to slow down and use extra caution to avoid
hydroplaning.
Frequent cloud to ground lightning is occurring with this storm.
Lightning can strike 10 miles away from a thunderstorm. Seek a safe
shelter inside a building or vehicle.</instruction>
