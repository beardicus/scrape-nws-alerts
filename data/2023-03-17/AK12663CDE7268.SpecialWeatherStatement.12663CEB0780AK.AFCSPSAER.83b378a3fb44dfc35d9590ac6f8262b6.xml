<description>...AREAS OF SNOW AND BLOWING SNOW TO CONTINUE THROUGH EARLY FRIDAY
AFTERNOON...
Areas of snow and blowing snow will continue across portions of
the western Kenai Peninsula through early Friday afternoon as a
storm system moves south of the region. Bands of snow are moving
from east to west across the Kenai Peninsula this morning, and
while most of the heavier snow will remain confined to the higher
elevations, periods of snow are likely to continue west of the
mountains, especially from Kenai south to Homer, through the next
several hours. The combination of snow and gusty northerly winds
may reduce visibility to as low as one half mile at times.
Visibility may also be reduced along the Sterling Highway to the
combination of snow, blowing snow, and resuspended snow from
vehicular traffic. Travel may become difficult and motorists are
urged to slow down and use caution.
