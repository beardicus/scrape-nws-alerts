<description>...HEAVY SNOW SHOWERS POSSIBLE THIS EVENING...
Periods of light snow will continue across the area this evening.
Gusty west winds will also produce some blowing and drifting of
the snow that has already fallen. Temperatures well below
freezing will result in untreated roads remaining snow covered and
slippery.
Scattered much stronger snow showers dropping southeast from
northwest Wisconsin and western Upper Michigan will also begin
affecting the area. Brief bursts of heavy snow with the stronger
snow showers could result in a significant reduction in
visibility--possibly to less than 1/4 mile--and a much faster
accumulation of snow on roads and sidewalks.
Anyone traveling this evening should be prepared for the
possibility of encountering heavy snow showers with greatly
reduced visibility. Use extra caution, and allow extra time to
reach your destination.</description>
