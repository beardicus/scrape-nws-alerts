<headline>Rip Current Statement issued March 17 at 4:01PM EDT until March 17 at 11:00PM EDT by NWS Tallahassee</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 AM EDT SATURDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding.
For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Coastal Franklin County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 3 AM EDT
Saturday. For the High Rip Current Risk, until 11 PM EDT this
evening.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Rip currents can sweep even
the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The main concern will be with the high tide
cycle late this evening. At high tide, normally dry ground near
the shoreline could experience around 2 feet of inundation.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
