NIGHT...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM MONDAY TO 6 PM AST
TUESDAY...

to 10 feet, and occasionally higher. Breakers will surpass 10
feet after 6 AM AST this afternoon.
* WHERE...for Culebra.
* WHEN...Through late Monday night.
* IMPACTS...Rip currents that can sweep even the best swimmers
away from shore into deeper water where it becomes difficult to
return to safety. Dangerous swimming conditions and localized
beach erosion.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...It is very likely that the High Rip
Current Risk statements might be extended through most of next

western Atlantic.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.
A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in
the advisory area, producing localized beach erosion and
dangerous swimming conditions.</instruction>
