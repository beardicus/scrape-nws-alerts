<headline>Wind Advisory issued May 19 at 2:17PM MDT until May 19 at 5:00PM MDT by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>...WIND ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM MDT THIS
AFTERNOON...
...WIND ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM TO 6 PM MDT FRIDAY...
...FREEZE WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...For the first Wind Advisory, northwest winds 25 to 35 mph
with gusts up to 50 mph expected. For the second Wind Advisory,
northwest winds 25 to 35 mph with gusts up to 55 mph. For the
Freeze Watch, sub-freezing temperatures as low as 31 possible.
* WHERE...The Northern Meade County Plains, the Pennington
County Plains and the Southern Meade County Plains.
* WHEN...For the first Wind Advisory, from 8 AM to 6 PM MDT
Friday. For the second Wind Advisory, until 5 PM MDT this
afternoon. For the Freeze Watch, from late Friday night
through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Sudden wind gusts can cause drivers to lose control,
especially in lightweight or high profile vehicles. Strong
winds can cause blowing dust, reduced visibility, and flying
debris. Frost and freeze conditions could kill crops, other
sensitive vegetation.</description>
<instruction>Use extra caution when driving, especially if operating a high
profile vehicle. Secure outdoor objects.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
