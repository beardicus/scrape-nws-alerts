temperatures as low as 26 possible.
* WHERE...In Utah, Eastern Uinta Basin. In Colorado, Lower Yampa

Power outages are possible. Travel will be difficult, especially
for high profile vehicles. Frost and freeze conditions could

unprotected outdoor plumbing.</description>
<instruction>People should avoid being outside in forested areas and around
trees and branches. If possible, remain in the lower levels of
your home during the windstorm, and avoid windows. Use caution if
you must drive.
People, especially those with respiratory illnesses, heart
disease, the elderly, and children are recommended to stay
indoors and avoid prolonged outdoor exercise or heavy exertion
due to wind-blown dust.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
