<headline>Hard Freeze Watch issued May 19 at 3:04AM MDT until May 21 at 9:00AM MDT by NWS Cheyenne</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 PM MDT THIS
AFTERNOON...
...HARD FREEZE WATCH IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY EVENING THROUGH
SATURDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...For the High Wind Warning, west winds 30 to 40 mph with
gusts up to 55 mph expected. For the Hard Freeze Watch, sub-
freezing temperatures as low as 22 possible.
* WHERE...South Laramie Range and South Laramie Range Foothills.
* WHEN...For the High Wind Warning, until 3 PM MDT this
afternoon. For the Hard Freeze Watch, from Friday evening
through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Damaging winds will blow down trees and power lines.
Widespread power outages are expected. Travel will be
difficult, especially for high profile vehicles. Frost and
freeze conditions could kill crops, other sensitive vegetation
and possibly damage unprotected outdoor plumbing.</description>
<instruction>People should avoid being outside in forested areas and around
trees and branches. If possible, remain in the lower levels of
your home during the windstorm, and avoid windows. Use caution if
you must drive.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
