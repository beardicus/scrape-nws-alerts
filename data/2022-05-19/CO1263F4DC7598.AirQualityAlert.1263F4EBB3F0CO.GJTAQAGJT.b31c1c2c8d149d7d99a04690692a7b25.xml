<description>...AIR QUALITY HEALTH ADVISORY FOR WILDFIRE SMOKE FROM 900 AM
THURSDAY UNTIL 900 AM FRIDAY...
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has
issued the following...
WHAT...Air Quality Health Advisory for Wildfire Smoke.
WHERE...northern Archuleta and southern Mineral Counties, along
with the entirety of Saguache, Rio Grande, Alamosa, Conejos, and
Costilla Counties. Locations include, but are not limited to
Pagosa Springs, Saguache, Del Norte, Alamosa, Conejos, and San
Luis.
WHEN...900 AM Thursday May 19 to 900 AM Friday May 20
IMPACTS...Moderate to heavy smoke can be expected Thursday morning
for areas in close vicinity to the Plumtaw wildfire, including
Pagosa Springs. Air quality will improve by late Thursday morning
as atmospheric mixing increases and smoke lifts into the
atmosphere. However, periods of moderate to heavy smoke will be
possible downwind to the east of the fire along the Archuleta and
Mineral County line, and additional heavy smoke impacts will be
possible across the San Luis Valley. By late Thursday evening
smoke will begin to drain to locations south and southwest of the
fire, including Pagosa Springs, bringing occasional heavy smoke
through early Friday morning. Any smoke in the San Luis Valley
could also linger through early Friday morning.
HEALTH INFORMATION...Public Health Recommendations: If smoke is
thick or becomes thick in your neighborhood you may want to remain
indoors. This is especially true for those with heart disease,
respiratory illnesses, the very young, and the elderly. Consider
limiting outdoor activity when moderate to heavy smoke is present.
Consider relocating temporarily if smoke is present indoors and is
making you ill. If visibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in
your neighborhood, smoke has reached levels that are unhealthy.</description>
