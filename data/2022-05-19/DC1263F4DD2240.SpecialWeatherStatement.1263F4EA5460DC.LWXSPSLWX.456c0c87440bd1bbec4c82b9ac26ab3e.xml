<description>...EARLY SEASON HEAT FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...
Temperatures will rise into the 90s Friday, Saturday, and Sunday
for the first time since last Autumn. Friday will be the first 90
degree day in the Baltimore and Washington Metropolitan Areas
since last September. Saturday is forecast to be the hottest day
of the weekend, with many locations reaching the mid-90s and heat
indices approaching 100. This level of heat will continue through
Sunday.
The abrupt beginning of hot temperatures early in the season after
a relatively cool spring brings an increased risk of heat
illnesses unless proper precautions are taken for those working
or recreating outdoors.
Since many outdoor events are planned this weekend in the region,
be aware of the heat, and take extra precautions if you work or
spend time outside this weekend. Reschedule strenuous activities
to early morning or evening. Plan to wear lightweight and loose
fitting clothing, and seek shade from the sun. Schedule frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments and stay
hydrated with non-alcoholic beverages.</description>
