<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM MDT FRIDAY...
The New Mexico Departments of Health and Environment has issued an
Air Quality Alert, until 1 PM MDT Friday.
An Air Quality Alert for Smoke has been issued.
* WHAT... Strengthening west and southwest winds through the rest of
the afternoon and especially into Friday combined with very dry air
will create widespread critical fire weather conditions across much
of New Mexico for the next 36 hours or so. Smoke from on-going
wildfires will be transported nearly due east through this evening
then generally to the east and northeast on Friday. An approaching
weather disturbance will maintain windy conditions across the
higher elevations of northern New Mexico tonight and broadly
disrupt typical nighttime drainage winds in the vicinity of the
large fires. The one exception may be in southwest areas of the
state where surface winds may decouple enough to allow smoke to
drift down-valley impacting areas south and southeast of the Black
fire.
* WHERE...Locations most likely to experience the most significant
impacts from smoke include the following counties: Catron, Colfax,
Mora, San Miguel, Sierra, and Socorro counties. Impacted
communities include but are not limited to: Arrey, Chacon, Elephant
Butte, Gallinas, Guadalupita, Hatch, Las Vegas, Magdalena, Mora,
Ocate, Pecos, Radium Springs, Sapello, San Antonio, Truth or
Consequences, and Winston.
* WHEN... Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1pm MDT
Friday, May 20th
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method
available at
https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
