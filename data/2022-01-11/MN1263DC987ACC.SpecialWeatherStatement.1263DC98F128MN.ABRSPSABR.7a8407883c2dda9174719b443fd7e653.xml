<description>...SPRINKLES OR PERHAPS FREEZING SPRINKLES POSSIBLE THROUGHOUT THE
JAMES RIVER VALLEY OVER INTO WESTERN MINNESOTA OVERNIGHT...
Very light rain or sprinkles will move down across parts of
northeast South Dakota into western Minnesota, mainly from the
James River valley region into far western Minnesota over the next
few hours. Although air temperature ranges from 35 to 40 degrees,
road surfaces may fall below and remain below freezing while it
rains very lightly, and could quickly become icy. Highways that
could be impacted the most will be north of US Highway 212 and
east of US Highway 281, including Interstate 29 from near
Watertown up to the border of the Dakotas.
The coverage of the precipitation is expected to be spotty and
quick moving. But areas that do receive very light rain or
sprinkles which freeze on impact with the ground are likely to
experience slippery roads and walking surfaces, which could
linger into Wednesday morning. Those with travel plans tonight
through Wednesday morning are encouraged to check the latest road
conditions before venturing out.</description>
