<headline>Flood Warning issued January 08 at 2:51PM EST until January 11 at 7:00AM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg SC has
issued a Flood Warning for the following rivers in North Carolina...
French Broad River At Blantyre affecting Henderson and
Transylvania Counties.
French Broad River Near Fletcher affecting Henderson and Buncombe
Counties.
.A potent storm system is expected to produce 4-6 inches of rainfall
across the upper French Broad River watershed from early Tuesday
morning through Tuesday evening.  This rainfall will quickly
overwhelm saturated soils and result in excessive runoff and
significant stream rises across Transylvania and Henderson counties,
with several tributaries of the French Broad River expected to
exceed bankfull and cause flooding of adjacent areas as early as
Tuesday morning.  This excessive flow will cause the upper French
Broad River from Rosman downstream to Brevard, Blantyre, Etowah, and
Fletcher to exceed Minor Flood Stage late Tuesday morning into
Tuesday afternoon and possibly Moderate Flood Stage by Wednesday
morning.  This will resulting in significant and damaging inundation
within the river valley impacting farmland, numerous flood-prone
roadways, and possibly some structures including outbuildings,
barns, crawl spaces, and basements.  Flooding may persist through
early Thursday.  Residents are advised to move vulnerable property
to higher ground and stay up-to-date by monitoring the latest river
levels and forecasts.

MORNING...

* WHERE...French Broad River near Fletcher.
* WHEN...From Tuesday afternoon to Thursday morning.

River floodwaters may be impacting several roads within the
valley, resulting in road closures including along Glenn Bridge
Rd., Pinner Rd., Butler Bridge Rd., Nelson Rd., Banner Farm Rd.,
Brannon Rd., Old Brevard Hwy., and Ladson Rd.  Widespread farmland
flooding is ongoing with floodwaters impacting some residential
and commercial property and outbuildings.  Adjacent parks and
river access points along the reach of the river are experiencing
significant inundation.
