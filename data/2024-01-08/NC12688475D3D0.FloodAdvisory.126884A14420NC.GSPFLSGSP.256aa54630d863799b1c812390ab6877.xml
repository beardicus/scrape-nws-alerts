<headline>Flood Advisory issued January 08 at 4:32PM EST until January 11 at 1:00AM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has issued
a Flood Advisory for the following rivers in North Carolina...
French Broad River At Asheville affecting Buncombe County.
French Broad River At Marshall affecting Madison County.
.A potent storm system is expected to produce 4-6 inches of rainfall
across the upper French Broad River watershed and 1.5-3 inches of
rainfall across the middle and lower French Broad River watershed
from early Tuesday morning through Tuesday evening.  This rainfall
will quickly overwhelm saturated soils and result in excessive
runoff and significant stream rises throughout the French Broad
River valley.  Nuisance to Minor flooding of some tributaries,
including the Ivy River, is possible beginning late Tuesday morning
or early Tuesday afternoon.  This excessive flow will cause portions
of the French Broad River from Bent Creek downstream to Biltmore,
Asheville, Woodfin, and Marshall to exceed Action/Advisory Stage
late Tuesday evening into early Wednesday morning, causing common,
nuisance flooding of low-lying areas.  If rainfall totals
significantly exceed current forecasts, higher crests across the
middle and lower French Broad River may occur, resulting in deeper
inundation of common, flood-prone areas adjacent to the river.  If
necessary, a River Flood Warning may be required.   Residents,
business owners, and recreational river users are encouraged to stay
up-to-date by monitoring the latest river levels and forecasts, as
conditions may change quickly.
...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM THIS AFTERNOON TO EARLY THURSDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Nuisance flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
expected.  Minor flooding is possible.
* WHERE...French Broad River at Marshall.
* WHEN...From this afternoon to early Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...At 7.0 feet, The French Broad River is starting to flood
low-lying areas on Blannahassett Island.  Low-lying areas along
Hayes Run Creek in the Rollins area are beginning to flood.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 3:00 PM EST Monday the stage was 2.3 feet and falling
steady.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise to a crest of 7.5
feet Wednesday morning.  The river may continue to rise to
near or just above Minor Flood Stage Wednesday morning.  If
the river significantly exceeds Minor Flood Stage, a River
Flood Warning may be issued.  Also, the river may exceed
critical levels earlier than currently forecast due to the
potential for intense rainfall rates.  Please closely monitor
the latest levels and forecasts.
- Action/Advisory Stage is 7.5 feet.
