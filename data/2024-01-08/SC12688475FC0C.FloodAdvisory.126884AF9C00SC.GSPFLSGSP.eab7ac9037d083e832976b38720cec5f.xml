<headline>Flood Advisory issued January 08 at 5:35PM EST until January 11 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has issued
a Flood Advisory for the following rivers in South Carolina...
Saluda River Near Greenville affecting Greenville and Pickens
Counties.
.A potent storm system is expected to produce 3-5 inches of rainfall
across the upper Saluda River watershed from from early Tuesday
morning through early Tuesday evening.  This rainfall will quickly
overwhelm saturated soils and result in excessive runoff and
significant stream rises for all forks of the Saluda River and
associated tributaries.  Minor to Moderate flooding of some
tributaries is likely beginning late Tuesday morning or early
Tuesday afternoon.  This excessive flow will cause portions of the
upper Saluda River to exceed bankfull or Action/Advisory Stage as
early as Tuesday evening.  The Saluda River may stay above bankfull
levels through Wednesday afternoon, causing common, nuisance
flooding of low-lying areas.  If rainfall totals significantly
exceed current forecasts, higher crests along the upper Saluda River
may occur, resulting in deeper inundation of common, flood-prone
areas adjacent to the river.  If necessary, a River Flood Warning
may be required.   Residents, business owners, and recreational
river users are encouraged to stay up-to-date by monitoring the
latest river levels and forecasts, as conditions may change quickly.
...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY EVENING TO THURSDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Nuisance flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
expected.  Minor flooding is possible.
* WHERE...Saluda River near Greenville.
* WHEN...From Tuesday evening to Thursday evening.
* IMPACTS...At 8.0 feet, Action/Advisory Stage.  Common, nuisance
flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to the Saluda River is
beginning.  Floodwaters are beginning to impact farmland,
woodlands, nurseries, parks, athletic fields, golf courses,
greenways, and boat-access areas with up to 2 feet of inundation.
Floodwaters are likely beginning to impact the lowest elevation of
residential yards along Shop Ct, Covenant Dr, Riverview Dr, and
Riverview Cir.
At 9.5 feet, Minor Flood Stage. Common, deeper flooding of
low-lying areas adjacent to the Saluda River is developing with
lesser impacts to vulnerable property.  More significant
floodwaters are beginning to impact low-lying areas downstream of
Saluda Dam, including the lowest elevation of residential yards
along Shop Ct, Covenant Dr, Riverview Dr, Riverview Cir, and Old
Easley Bridge Rd.  Floodwaters may be approaching River Rd near
Myers Ln.  Residents next to the river need to take precautions to
protect vulnerable property, closely monitor the latest river
levels and forecast, and follow guidance from Pickens and
Greenville County Emergency Management.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 4:45 PM EST Monday the stage was 3.5 feet and steady.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise to a crest of 8.7
feet early Wednesday morning.  The river may continue to rise
to near or just above Minor Flood Stage Wednesday morning.

latest levels and forecasts.
