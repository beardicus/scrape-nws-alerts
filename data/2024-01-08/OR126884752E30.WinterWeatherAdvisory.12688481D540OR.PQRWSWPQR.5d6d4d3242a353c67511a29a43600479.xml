<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 08 at 9:08AM PST until January 08 at 4:00PM PST by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...BLIZZARD CONDITIONS EXPECTED FOR THE CASCADE PASSES AND ABOVE
TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY...
.OVERVIEW...The heaviest snow so far this season is on its way to
the Cascades after a strong cold front sweeps across the Pacific
Northwest Monday night, ushering in much colder air and more
seasonable snow levels for Tuesday. Strong and deep onshore flow
will lead to periods of heavy snow, strong winds, and near zero
visibility for the Cascades, especially for exposed areas above
3500 feet. This has prompted us to issue a rare Blizzard Warning
for the Cascade passes and above, with Winter Storm Warnings
extending as low as 1500 to 2000 feet in the Cascade foothills.
By the time snow showers decrease Wednesday, elevations 3000 feet
and above will likely be measuring their snow in feet, rather
than inches.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM PST THIS
AFTERNOON ABOVE 1500 FEET...
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM TUESDAY TO
4 PM PST WEDNESDAY ABOVE 1500 FEET...
* WHAT...Wet snow and possible freezing rain today. Heavy snow and
gusty winds expected Tuesday through Wednesday. Snow
accumulation of 1 to 4 inches today, with a light glaze of ice
possible. Snow accumulations of 6 to 14 inches Tuesday through
Wednesday, with heaviest accumulations above 2000 feet. Winds
gusting up to 55 mph on exposed ridges.
* WHERE...Upper Hood River Valley above 1500 feet.
* WHEN...
Winter Weather Advisory....from 4 AM to 4 PM Monday.
Winter Storm Warning.......from 4 AM Tuesday to 4 PM Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. Strong winds could
cause tree damage.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...After a period where snow levels are well
above the Cascade passes Monday night, snow levels will
plummet to around 1500 to 2000 feet by midday Tuesday.</description>
