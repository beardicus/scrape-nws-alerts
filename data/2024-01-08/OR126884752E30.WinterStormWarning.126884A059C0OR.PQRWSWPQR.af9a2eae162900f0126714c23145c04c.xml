<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 08 at 9:08AM PST until January 10 at 4:00PM PST by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...BLIZZARD CONDITIONS EXPECTED FOR THE CASCADE PASSES AND ABOVE
TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY...
.OVERVIEW...The heaviest snow so far this season is on its way to
the Cascades after a strong cold front sweeps across the Pacific
Northwest Monday night, ushering in much colder air and more
seasonable snow levels for Tuesday. Strong and deep onshore flow
will lead to periods of heavy snow, strong winds, and near zero
visibility for the Cascades, especially for exposed areas above
3500 feet. This has prompted us to issue a rare Blizzard Warning
for the Cascade passes and above, with Winter Storm Warnings
extending as low as 1500 to 2000 feet in the Cascade foothills.
By the time snow showers decrease Wednesday, elevations 3000 feet
and above will likely be measuring their snow in feet, rather
than inches.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM PST THIS
AFTERNOON ABOVE 3000 FEET...
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM TUESDAY TO
4 PM PST WEDNESDAY ABOVE 1500 FEET...
...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM TUESDAY TO 4 PM
PST WEDNESDAY ABOVE 3000 FEET...
* WHAT...Snow expected Monday. Heavy snow, strong winds, and
near zero visibility expected Tuesday through Wednesday,
especially above 3000 feet. Additional snow accumulations
Monday will range from 2 to 8 inches, mainly above 3000 feet
in elevation. Snow accumulations Tuesday through Wednesday on
the order of 1 to 4 feet, heaviest above 3000 feet in
elevation. Southwest to west winds may gust as high as 55 mph
at pass level and as high as 75 mph for the higher ski resort
elevations.
* WHERE...In Oregon, Northern Oregon Cascades. In Washington,
South Washington Cascades.
* WHEN...
Winter Weather Advisory.... from 4 AM to 4 PM Monday.
Winter Storm Warning.... ...from 4 AM Tuesday to 4 PM Wednesday.
Blizzard Warning (3000`+).. from 4 AM Tuesday to 4 PM Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...The combination of heavy snow and strong winds will
occasionally result in white-out conditions Tuesday through
Wednesday. Poor visibility and rapid snow accumulation of up
to 2 inches per hour will result in dangerous conditions for
even the most experienced of drivers Tuesday, Tuesday night,
and into Wednesday. Strong winds and heavy snow may bring down
tree limbs, leading to power outages. Increasingly cold and
windy conditions will make the outdoors hazardous for the
unprepared.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...After a period where snow levels are well
above the Cascade passes Monday night, snow levels will
plummet to around 1500 to 2000 feet by midday Tuesday.</description>

Travel Tuesday through early Wednesday should be restricted to
emergencies only. If you must travel, make sure your cell phone
is charged, make sure someone knows where you`re going, and be
