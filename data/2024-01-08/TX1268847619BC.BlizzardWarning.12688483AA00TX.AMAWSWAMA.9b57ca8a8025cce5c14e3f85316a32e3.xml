blowing snow with strong winds are likely. Do not travel. This will
lead to whiteout conditions, making travel extremely dangerous. Do

situation, have a winter survival kit with you and notify a friend
or family of your plans. Do not travel. If you get stranded, stay in
your vehicle. Do not travel.</instruction>
