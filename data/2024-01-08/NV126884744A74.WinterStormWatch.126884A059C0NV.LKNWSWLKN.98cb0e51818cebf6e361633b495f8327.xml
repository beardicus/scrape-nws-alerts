<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 08 at 3:25AM PST until January 10 at 4:00PM PST by NWS Elko</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 2 to
5 inches in mid elevations and up to 10 inches in higher
elevations are possible. Winds could gust as high as 55 mph.
* WHERE...Northern Elko County and Ruby Mountains and East
Humboldt Range.
* WHEN...From Tuesday morning through Wednesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Patchy blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute. Gusty
winds could bring down tree branches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Two rounds of active weather over the
course of the Tuesday and Wednesday timeframe bring a
combination of snowfall and strong sustained winds. This will
lead to periods of treacherous travel conditions, particularly
in portions of the watch area. Even though there is a lull in
active snowfall Tuesday evening, this won`t last long enough to
provide any break from poor weather conditions and accumulating
snowfall coupled with strong winds return during the Wednesday
morning hours.</description>
