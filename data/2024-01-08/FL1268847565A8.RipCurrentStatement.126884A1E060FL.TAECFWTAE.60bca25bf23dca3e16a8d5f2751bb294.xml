<headline>Rip Current Statement issued January 08 at 1:50PM EST until January 11 at 5:00AM EST by NWS Tallahassee</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE WEDNESDAY
NIGHT...
...HIGH SURF WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 AM EST /10 AM
CST/ WEDNESDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM EST /MIDNIGHT CST/
TUESDAY TO 1 AM EST /MIDNIGHT CST/ WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
For the High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking waves of
up to 12 feet expected in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood
Advisory, minor coastal flooding expected.
* WHERE...South Walton, Coastal Bay and Coastal Gulf Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through late Wednesday
night. For the High Surf Warning, until 11 AM EST /10 AM CST/
Wednesday. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 1 AM EST
/midnight CST/ Tuesday to 1 AM EST /midnight CST/ Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Peak water levels of 2 to 3 feet above normally dry
ground is expected on Tuesday. This will result in flooding of
beach access areas and parking lots. Breaking waves can sweep
people off jetties and docks, and into dangerous seas. Life-
threatening swimming conditions and significant beach erosion
can be expected. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers
away from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other waterside
infrastructure.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
