<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued January 08 at 3:39PM EST until January 10 at 10:00AM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 5 AM TO 10 AM EST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level expected in
vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...In New Jersey, Hudson, Eastern Bergen, Eastern Essex
and Eastern Union Counties. In New York, New York (Manhattan),
Richmond (Staten Island) and Kings (Brooklyn) Counties.
* WHEN...From 5 AM to 10 AM EST Wednesday.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Widespread minor flooding is expected
in the most vulnerable locations near the waterfront and
shoreline. Expect around 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground
level in low lying, vulnerable areas. Some roads and low lying
property including parking lots, parks, lawns and
homes/businesses with basements near the waterfront will
experience shallow flooding.
* RIVERINE IMPACTS...Runoff coinciding with the Wednesday morning
high tide will exacerbate street and property flooding issues
along tidal portions of the Hackensack and Passaic Rivers in
Bergen, Essex and Hudson Counties.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Peak surge of 4 to 5 ft will likely be
between times of high tide Tuesday evening and Wednesday
morning. The timing of an offshore windshift before the time of
high tide Wednesday morning should keep water levels below
moderate flood levels, but will exacerbate riverine flooding
along tidal reaches of the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers. In
addition, heavy rain during the Tuesday evening high tide will
likely exacerbate urban and poor drainage flood issues for
coastal and shoreline roads.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
