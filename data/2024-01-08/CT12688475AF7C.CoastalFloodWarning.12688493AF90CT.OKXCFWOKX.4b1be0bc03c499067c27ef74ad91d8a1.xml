<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued January 08 at 3:39PM EST until January 10 at 12:00PM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM TO NOON EST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level
expected in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...Southern Middlesex and Southern New London Counties.
* WHEN...From 6 AM to noon EST Wednesday.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Widespread moderate flooding of
vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline Wednesday
morning. Expect 2 to 2 1/2 ft of inundation above ground level
in low lying, vulnerable areas. This will result in numerous
road closures and cause widespread flooding of low lying
property including parking lots, parks, lawns and
homes/businesses with basements near the waterfront. Vehicles
parked in vulnerable areas near the waterfront will likely
become flooded. Flooding will also extend inland from the
waterfront along tidal rivers and bays.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...Breaking waves of 3 to 5 ft during the
Wednesday morning high tide. This will result in beach erosion,
and wave splashover onto shoreline roads and properties.
* RIVERINE IMPACTS...Freshwater runoff coinciding with the
Wednesday morning high tide will exacerbate street and property
flooding issues along tidal reaches of rivers in southeastern CT.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Peak surge of 4 to 5 ft will likely be
between times of high tide Tuesday evening and Wednesday
morning.</description>
