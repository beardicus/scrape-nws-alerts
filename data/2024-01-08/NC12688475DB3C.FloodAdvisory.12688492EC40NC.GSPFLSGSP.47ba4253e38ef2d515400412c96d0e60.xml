<headline>Flood Advisory issued January 08 at 4:51PM EST until January 10 at 7:00AM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has issued
a Flood Advisory for the following rivers in North Carolina...
Pigeon River At Canton affecting Haywood County.
.A potent storm system is expected to produce 3-6 inches of rainfall
across the east and west forks of the Pigeon River watershed from
from early Tuesday morning through Tuesday afternoon.  This rainfall
will quickly overwhelm saturated soils and result in excessive
runoff and significant stream rises in both the East Fork and West
Fork Pigeon rivers, with flash flooding possible.  This excessive
flow will cause portions of the Pigeon River from Max Thompson Rd to
Clyde to exceed bankfull or Action/Advisory Stage, causing common,
nuisance flooding of low-lying areas.  If rainfall totals
significantly exceed current forecasts, higher crests along the
Pigeon River may occur, resulting in deeper inundation of common,
flood-prone areas adjacent to the river.  If necessary, a River
Flood Warning may be required.   Residents and business owners are
encouraged to stay up-to-date by monitoring the latest river levels
and forecasts, as conditions may change quickly.
...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY MORNING TO WEDNESDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.  Minor
flooding is possible.
* WHERE...Pigeon River at Canton.
* WHEN...From Tuesday morning to Wednesday morning.
* IMPACTS...At 9.0 feet, Water may begin to flood parts of Vance
Street closest to the river and some parts of Fiberville Road.

near Fiberville Road.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 4:15 PM EST Monday the stage was 2.0 feet and nearly
steady.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise to a crest of 9.5
feet tomorrow evening.  The river may continue to rise to
near or just above Minor Flood Stage Wednesday morning.  If
the river significantly exceeds Minor Flood Stage, a River
Flood Warning may be issued.  Please closely monitor the
latest levels and forecasts.
