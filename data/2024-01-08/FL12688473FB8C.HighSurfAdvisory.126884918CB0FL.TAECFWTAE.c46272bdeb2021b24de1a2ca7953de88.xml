<headline>High Surf Advisory issued January 08 at 4:23AM EST until January 09 at 10:00PM EST by NWS Tallahassee</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE WEDNESDAY
NIGHT...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 10 PM THIS EVENING TO 10 PM
EST TUESDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY MORNING
THROUGH LATE TUESDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of up to 8 feet
expected in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Watch, minor to
moderate coastal flooding possible.
* WHERE...Coastal Franklin County.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through late Wednesday
night. For the High Surf Advisory, from 10 PM this evening to
10 PM EST Tuesday. For the Coastal Flood Watch, from Tuesday
morning through late Tuesday night.
* IMPACTS...Water levels could be highest around the time of high
tide, particularly east of Carrabelle where the high tide is
closer to midday. Water could overwash coastal roads and even
impact non-elevated structures in flood prone areas like
Alligator Point and Saint Teresa. Some shoreline erosion may
occur. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from
shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.</instruction>
