<headline>Flood Warning issued January 08 at 3:48PM EST until January 10 at 9:00PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg SC has
issued a Flood Warning for the following rivers in North Carolina...
Broad River In NC At Boiling Springs affecting Cleveland County.
.A potent storm system is expected to produce 3.5-4.5 inches of
rainfall across the upper Broad River watershed from Tuesday morning
through Tuesday evening.  This rainfall will quickly overwhelm
saturated soils and result in excessive runoff and significant
stream rises across Rutherford and Cleveland Counties, with some
small tributaries of the Broad River possibly exceeding bankfull and
causing nuisance to Minor flooding of adjacent areas as early as
late Tuesday morning.  This excessive flow will cause the Broad
River from downstream of Cliffside to the Broad River Greenway to
Gaston Shoals to exceed Action/Advisory Stage Tuesday afternoon and
Minor Flood Stage Wednesday morning.  This will result in common,
deeper flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to the Broad River with
lesser impacts to vulnerable property.  Residents are advised to
move vulnerable property to higher ground and stay up-to-date by
monitoring the latest river levels and forecasts.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY EVENING TO LATE WEDNESDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is forecast.

basements of homes between Abe`s Mountain Rd. and the river.  The
Broad River is likely flooding boat-access areas and the lowest
elevations of Broad River Greenway with at least 1-2 feet of
floodwaters.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 3:15 PM EST Monday the stage was 2.9 feet and falling
steadily.
- Action/Advisory Stage is 12.0 feet.

<instruction>Even 6 inches of fast-moving flood water can knock you off your feet
and a depth of 2 feet will float your car. Never try to walk, swim,
or drive through such swift water. If you come upon flood waters,
stop, turn around and go another way.
Caution is urged when walking near riverbanks.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
