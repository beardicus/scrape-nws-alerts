<headline>Coastal Flood Watch issued January 08 at 2:50AM PST until January 09 at 2:00PM PST by NWS Seattle</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH
TUESDAY AFTERNOON...
...HIGH SURF WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 7 AM TUESDAY TO 10 AM PST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Watch, significant coastal flooding
possible. Inundation of 2 to 3 feet above ground level is
possible along shorelines and low-lying coastal areas. For the
High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking waves of 13 to 29
feet expected in the surf zone.
* WHERE...North Coast and Central Coast zones.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Watch, from Tuesday morning
through Tuesday afternoon. For the High Surf Warning, from 7
AM Tuesday to 10 AM PST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Numerous roads may be closed. Low lying property
including homes, businesses, and some critical infrastructure
may be inundated. Some shoreline erosion may occur. Breaking
waves can sweep people off jetties and docks, and into
dangerous seas. Life-threatening swimming conditions and
significant beach erosion can be expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Strong low pressure is expected to move
just north of the region Tuesday, which, when combined with
strong onshore flow and westerly swell, may enhance the threat
for coastal flooding Tuesday.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other waterside
infrastructure.</instruction>
