<headline>High Surf Advisory issued January 08 at 1:50PM EST until January 09 at 10:00PM EST by NWS Tallahassee</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE WEDNESDAY
NIGHT...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 10 PM THIS EVENING
TO 10 PM EST TUESDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 7 AM TUESDAY TO 1 AM EST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of up to 8 feet
expected in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Warning, minor
to moderate coastal flooding expected.
* WHERE...Coastal Franklin County.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through late Wednesday
night. For the High Surf Advisory, from 10 PM this evening to
10 PM EST Tuesday. For the Coastal Flood Warning, from 7 AM
Tuesday to 1 AM EST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Water levels will be highest east of Carrabelle where
the high tide will line up with the strongest onshore winds.
From Carrabelle to the Ochlockonee River Entrance, water levels
along the coast are expected to reach 3 to 4 feet above normally
dry ground, resulting in flooding of coastal roads and
inundation of non-elevated structures along the coast. West of
Carrabelle, water levels of 2 to 3 feet above normally dry
ground are expected, which will result in flooding of low lying
roadways near the immediate coast. Some shoreline erosion will
occur. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized
beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers
away from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
