- A powerful low pressure system will spread heavy rain across
the region beginning this evening and continuing into
Tuesday.  Rainfall amounts of 3 to 5 inches are expected
across the mountains of northeast Georgia, the northern
Upstate north of Interstate 85, and the southern mountains of
North Carolina. Some locations in the mountains could get 6
inches of rain. The threat of flash flooding has been
increased given the recent rainfall in this area.

<instruction>A Flood Watch for flash flooding means there is a potential for
rapid onset flooding based on current forecasts. Flash flooding is a
very dangerous situation and may impact areas that do not typically
flood. Please monitor the latest forecasts and be prepared to take
action quickly should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.
Rainfall of more than five inches in similar storms has been
associated with an increased risk of landslides and rockslides. If
you live on a mountainside or in a cove at the base of a mountain,
especially near a stream, be ready to leave in advance of the storm
or as quickly as possible should rising water, moving earth, or
rocks threaten. Consider postponing travel along mountain roads
during periods of heavy rainfall.</instruction>
