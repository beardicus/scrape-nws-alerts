<headline>Flood Watch issued January 08 at 2:47PM EST  by NWS Philadelphia - Mount Holly</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of New Jersey, including the following areas,
Hunterdon, Morris, Somerset, Sussex and Warren and Pennsylvania,
including the following areas, Berks, Carbon, Eastern Chester,
Eastern Montgomery, Lehigh, Monroe, Northampton, Upper Bucks,
Western Chester and Western Montgomery.
* WHEN...From Tuesday afternoon through Wednesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Area creeks and streams are running high and could flood with more
heavy rain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rainfall of 2 to 3 inches with locally up to 4 inches
possible Tuesday through early Wednesday, with the heaviest
rain falling Tuesday night. The ground remains very saturated
following multiple rounds of heavy rainfall over the last
month. A period of higher hourly rainfall rates is possible
during Tuesday night which would enhance the potential for
flooding, particularly in more urban areas. The combination
of snowmelt and heavy rain may significantly elevate the
flooding risk, especially across northeast Pennsylvania and
northern New Jersey.

Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
