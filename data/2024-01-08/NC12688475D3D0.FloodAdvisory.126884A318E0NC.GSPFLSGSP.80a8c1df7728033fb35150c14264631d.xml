<headline>Flood Advisory issued January 08 at 4:32PM EST until January 11 at 1:00PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has issued
a Flood Advisory for the following rivers in North Carolina...
French Broad River At Asheville affecting Buncombe County.
French Broad River At Marshall affecting Madison County.
.A potent storm system is expected to produce 4-6 inches of rainfall
across the upper French Broad River watershed and 1.5-3 inches of
rainfall across the middle and lower French Broad River watershed
from early Tuesday morning through Tuesday evening.  This rainfall
will quickly overwhelm saturated soils and result in excessive
runoff and significant stream rises throughout the French Broad
River valley.  Nuisance to Minor flooding of some tributaries,
including the Ivy River, is possible beginning late Tuesday morning
or early Tuesday afternoon.  This excessive flow will cause portions
of the French Broad River from Bent Creek downstream to Biltmore,
Asheville, Woodfin, and Marshall to exceed Action/Advisory Stage
late Tuesday evening into early Wednesday morning, causing common,
nuisance flooding of low-lying areas.  If rainfall totals
significantly exceed current forecasts, higher crests across the
middle and lower French Broad River may occur, resulting in deeper
inundation of common, flood-prone areas adjacent to the river.  If
necessary, a River Flood Warning may be required.   Residents,
business owners, and recreational river users are encouraged to stay
up-to-date by monitoring the latest river levels and forecasts, as
conditions may change quickly.
