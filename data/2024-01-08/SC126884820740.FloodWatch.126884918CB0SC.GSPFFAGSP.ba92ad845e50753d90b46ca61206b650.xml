<description>.A strong low pressure system moving from the Plains overnight to
the Midwest on Tuesday will permit abundant Gulf moisture to stream
across the western Carolinas and northeast Georgia during the Flood
Watch period. The heavy rainfall will spread across the region
during the early morning hours, maximize atop the area Tuesday
morning through early afternoon, and then move east through Tuesday
evening. With rivers and streams still somewhat elevated from
previous heavy rainfall, flooding is expected to develop across the
region.
