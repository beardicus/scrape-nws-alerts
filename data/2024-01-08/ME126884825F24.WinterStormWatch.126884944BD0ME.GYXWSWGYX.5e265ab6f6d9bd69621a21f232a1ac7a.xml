<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 08 at 10:53PM EST until January 10 at 4:00PM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY EVENING THROUGH
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Heavy, wet snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 8 to
12 inches with greater than 12 inches possible across the higher
terrain. Winds could gust as high as 55 mph.
* WHERE...In Maine, Central Somerset, Northern Franklin, and
Northern Oxford Counties. In New Hampshire, Northern Coos and
Southern Coos Counties.
* WHEN...From Tuesday evening through Wednesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Visibilities may drop below 1/4 mile due to falling and
blowing snow. Wet snow will readily cling to branches and power
lines. The strong winds and weight of snow on tree limbs may down
power lines and could cause sporadic power outages. Significant
snowfall and periods of heavy snowfall rates will combine with low
visibility to create very dangerous driving conditions. The
hazardous conditions could impact the Wednesday morning commute.</description>
<instruction>Monitor the latest forecasts for updates on this situation.
Persons should consider delaying all travel. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution. Consider taking a winter
storm kit along with you, including such items as tire chains,
booster cables, flashlight, shovel, blankets and extra clothing.
Also take water, a first aid kit, and anything else that would help
you survive in case you become stranded.</instruction>
