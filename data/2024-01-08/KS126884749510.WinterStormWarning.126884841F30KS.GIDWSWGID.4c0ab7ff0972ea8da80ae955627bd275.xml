<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 08 at 7:16AM CST until January 09 at 9:00AM CST by NWS Hastings</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM CST TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations mainly
between 5 and 10 inches, except for the Mitchell County Kansas
area where slightly lower amounts are favored. North winds gusting
as high as 35 to 45 MPH starting mainly late this afternoon into
tonight, with near-blizzard conditions possible.
* WHERE...Portions of north central Kansas and central, east
central, and south central Nebraska.
* WHEN...Until 9 AM CST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Widespread falling and
eventually blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility to
around 1/2 mile at times, especially in open, rural areas,
creating near-blizzard conditions. The hazardous conditions could
impact especially the Monday evening and Tuesday morning commutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Precipitation could start as rain or sleet
this morning, especially near and south of the Kansas border, but
should change to snow within a few hours. Although much of the
area will see moderate to heavy snow already this morning into
early afternoon, the strongest winds and most likely time frame
for possible near-blizzard conditions will not occur until later
this afternoon into this evening north winds increase across the
area from west-to-east and gust as high as 35 to 45 MPH. The
majority of accumulating snow will fall today into this evening,
but lingering lighter snow and strong winds will continue into
Tuesday morning.</description>
