<headline>Flood Warning issued January 08 at 2:51PM EST until January 11 at 1:00PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg SC has
issued a Flood Warning for the following rivers in North Carolina...
French Broad River At Blantyre affecting Henderson and
Transylvania Counties.
French Broad River Near Fletcher affecting Henderson and Buncombe
Counties.
.A potent storm system is expected to produce 4-6 inches of rainfall
across the upper French Broad River watershed from early Tuesday
morning through Tuesday evening.  This rainfall will quickly
overwhelm saturated soils and result in excessive runoff and
significant stream rises across Transylvania and Henderson counties,
with several tributaries of the French Broad River expected to
exceed bankfull and cause flooding of adjacent areas as early as
Tuesday morning.  This excessive flow will cause the upper French
Broad River from Rosman downstream to Brevard, Blantyre, Etowah, and
Fletcher to exceed Minor Flood Stage late Tuesday morning into
Tuesday afternoon and possibly Moderate Flood Stage by Wednesday
morning.  This will resulting in significant and damaging inundation
within the river valley impacting farmland, numerous flood-prone
roadways, and possibly some structures including outbuildings,
barns, crawl spaces, and basements.  Flooding may persist through
early Thursday.  Residents are advised to move vulnerable property
to higher ground and stay up-to-date by monitoring the latest river
levels and forecasts.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY AFTERNOON TO EARLY THURSDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is forecast.  Moderate flooding is possible.
* WHERE...French Broad River at Blantyre.
* WHEN...From Tuesday afternoon to early Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...At 19.0 feet, Moderate Flood Stage.  Extensive flooding
of the upper French Broad River Valley is ongoing, resulting in
significant farmland inundation and affecting several roads
between Rosman and Horse Shoe.  Parts of Lyons Mountain Rd, Hannah
Ford Rd, Green Rd, Island Ford Rd, Barclay Rd, Wilson Rd, Poplar
Ln, River Rd, Pleasant Grove Rd, Butler Bridge Rd, and Big Willow
Rd are likely inundated by at least 1-3 feet of floodwaters.
Floodwaters may be threatening a trailer park on River Ridge Rd.
Floodwaters may be approaching buildings north of Grove Bridge
Road along US 64.  Associated tributaries, including Little River,
are likely flooding due to high water levels on the French Broad
River.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1:30 PM EST Monday the stage was 7.6 feet and falling
slowly.
- Action/Advisory Stage is 15.0 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above Minor Flood
Stage tomorrow afternoon and reach a crest of 18.5 feet
Wednesday morning.  It will then fall below Minor Flood Stage
Thursday morning.  The river may exceed Minor Flood Stage
earlier than currently forecast due to the potential for
intense rainfall rates.  Also, a crest above the Moderate
Flood Stage of 19.0 feet is possible Wednesday morning.
Please closely monitor the latest levels and forecasts.
- Minor Flood Stage is 16.0 feet.
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
