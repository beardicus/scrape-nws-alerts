<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued January 08 at 12:50PM PST until January 09 at 4:00PM PST by NWS Seattle</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 2 AM TO 4 PM PST
TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Minor coastal flooding expected. Inundation of 2 to 3
feet above ground level is possible along shorelines and low-
lying coastal areas.
* WHERE...Eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca and Western Strait of
Juan De Fuca zones.
* WHEN...From 2 AM to 4 PM PST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Minor coastal flooding due to tidal overflow is
expected around high tide. This may lead to flooding of
parking lots, parks, and roads, with only isolated road
closures expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Strong low pressure is expected to move
just north of the region Tuesday, which, when combined with
strong westerly flow through the Strait of Juan de Fuca, may
enhance the threat for coastal flooding Tuesday.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inundation above ground level refers to the height above the Mean
Higher High Water (MHHW) level.</instruction>
