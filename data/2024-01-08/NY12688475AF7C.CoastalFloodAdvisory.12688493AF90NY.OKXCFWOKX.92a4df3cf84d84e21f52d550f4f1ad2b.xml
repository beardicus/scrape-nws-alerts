<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued January 08 at 3:39PM EST until January 10 at 12:00PM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM TUESDAY TO NOON EST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level with Tuesday
evening and Wednesday morning high tides expected in vulnerable
areas near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...In Connecticut, Southern Fairfield and Southern New
Haven Counties. In New York, Southern Westchester, Northwest
Suffolk and Northern Nassau Counties.
* WHEN...From 7 PM Tuesday to noon EST Wednesday.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Widespread minor flooding is expected in
the most vulnerable locations near the waterfront and shoreline.
Expect around 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level in
low lying, vulnerable areas. Some roads and low lying property
including parking lots, parks, lawns and homes/businesses with
basements near the waterfront will experience shallow flooding.
* RIVERINE IMPACTS...Freshwater runoff coinciding with the
Wednesday morning high tide will exacerbate street and property
flooding issues along tidal reaches of rivers in southern CT and
Westchester. Surge up the Hudson River with the Wednesday
morning high tide will likely cause minor flooding for low-lying
river-front communities in Westchester, Rockland, Orange and
Putnam counties.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...Breaking waves of 3 to 5 ft during the
Tuesday evening high tide. This may result in beach erosion, and
wave splashover onto shoreline roads and properties. Wave
action should subside to 2 to 3 ft for the Wednesday morning
high tide.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Peak surge of 4 to 5 ft will likely be
between times of high tide Tuesday evening and Wednesday
morning. The timing of an offshore windshift before the time of
high tide Wednesday morning should keep water levels below
moderate flood levels, but will exacerbate riverine flooding
along tidal reaches of southern CT and Westchester Rivers. In
addition, heavy rain during the Tuesday evening high tide will
likely exacerbate urban and poor drainage flood issues for
coastal and shoreline roads.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
