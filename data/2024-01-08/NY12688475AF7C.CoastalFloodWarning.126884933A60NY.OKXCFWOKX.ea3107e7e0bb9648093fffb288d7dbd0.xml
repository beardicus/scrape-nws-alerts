<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued January 08 at 3:39PM EST until January 10 at 9:00AM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 5 AM TO 9 AM EST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...2 to 2 1/2 feet of inundation above ground level expected
in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline with the
Wednesday morning high tide.
* WHERE...Southern Queens County.
* WHEN...From 5 AM to 9 AM EST Wednesday.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Moderate flooding of vulnerable areas
near the waterfront and shoreline, particularly Wednesday
morning. Expect 2 to 2 1/2 ft of inundation above ground level
in low lying, vulnerable areas. This will result in numerous
road closures and cause widespread flooding of low lying
property including parking lots, parks, lawns and
homes/businesses with basements near the waterfront. Vehicles
parked in vulnerable areas near the waterfront will likely
become flooded. Flooding will also extend inland from the
waterfront along tidal rivers and bays.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...Large breaking waves of 10 to 15 ft along
the oceanfront will result in scattered dune erosion and
localized overwashes. Localized flooding of roadways and
vulnerable structures behind protective dunes is possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Peak surge of 4 to 5 ft will likely be
between times of high tide Tuesday evening and Wednesday
morning. The timing of an offshore windshift before the time of
high tide Wednesday morning is expected to keep the threat for
major flood thresholds (3 ft of inundation above ground) to be
reached low and localized. Surge guidance trends will be monitor
and forecast refined over the next 24 hours. In addition, heavy
rain during the Tuesday evening high tide will likely exacerbate
urban and poor drainage flood issues for coastal and shoreline
roads.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
