<headline>Flood Warning issued January 08 at 9:12PM EST until January 11 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...Forecast flooding changed from Minor to Moderate severity and
increased in duration for the following rivers in North Carolina...
French Broad River At Blantyre affecting Henderson and
Transylvania Counties.
.A potent storm system is expected to produce 4-6 inches of rainfall
across the upper French Broad River watershed from early Tuesday
morning through Tuesday evening.  This rainfall will quickly
overwhelm saturated soils and result in excessive runoff and
significant stream rises across Transylvania and Henderson counties,
with several tributaries of the French Broad River expected to
exceed bankfull and cause Minor to Moderate flooding of adjacent
areas as early as Tuesday morning.  This excessive flow will cause
the upper French Broad River from Rosman downstream to Brevard,
Blantyre, Etowah, and Fletcher to exceed Minor Flood Stage late
Tuesday morning into Tuesday afternoon and Moderate Flood Stage by
Wednesday morning.  This will result in significant and damaging
inundation within the river valley impacting farmland, numerous
flood-prone roadways, and possibly some structures including
outbuildings, barns, crawl spaces, and basements.  Flooding may
persist into Thursday afternoon.  Residents are advised to move
vulnerable property to higher ground and stay up-to-date by
monitoring the latest river levels and forecasts.
...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY AFTERNOON TO THURSDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Moderate flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...French Broad River at Blantyre.
* WHEN...From Tuesday afternoon to Thursday evening.
* IMPACTS...At 19.0 feet, Moderate Flood Stage.  Extensive flooding
of the upper French Broad River Valley is ongoing, resulting in
significant farmland inundation and affecting several roads
between Rosman and Horse Shoe.  Parts of Lyons Mountain Rd, Hannah
Ford Rd, Green Rd, Island Ford Rd, Barclay Rd, Wilson Rd, Poplar
Ln, River Rd, Pleasant Grove Rd, Butler Bridge Rd, and Big Willow
Rd are likely inundated by at least 1-3 feet of floodwaters.
Floodwaters may be threatening a trailer park on River Ridge Rd.
Floodwaters may be approaching buildings north of Grove Bridge
Road along US 64.  Associated tributaries, including Little River,
are likely flooding due to high water levels on the French Broad
River.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 8:30 PM EST Monday the stage was 7.5 feet and falling
slowly.
- Action/Advisory Stage is 15.0 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above Minor Flood
Stage by tomorrow evening.  The river is expected to exceed
Moderate Flood Stage by Wednesday morning, cresting at 19.1
feet Wednesday morning.  It will then fall below Minor Flood
Stage Thursday morning.  The river may exceed Minor Flood
Stage   earlier than currently forecast due to the potential
for intense rainfall rates.  The river may rise above the
forecasted crest.  Please closely monitor the latest levels
and forecasts.
- Minor Flood Stage is 16.0 feet.

or drive through such swift water. If you come upon flood waters,
stop, turn around and go another way.
