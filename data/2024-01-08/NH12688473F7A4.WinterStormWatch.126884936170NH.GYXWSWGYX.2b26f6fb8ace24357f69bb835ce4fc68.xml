<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 08 at 4:13AM EST until January 10 at 10:00AM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY EVENING THROUGH
WEDNESDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Heavy, wet snow possible. Total snow accumulations greater
than 8 inches possible. Winds could gust as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of south central, southwest, and western Maine
and northern New Hampshire.
* WHEN...From Tuesday evening through Wednesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Wet snow will readily cling to branches and power lines.
The strong winds and weight of snow on tree limbs may down power
lines and could cause sporadic power outages. Significant snowfall
and periods of heavy snowfall rates will combine with low
visibility to create very dangerous driving conditions. The
hazardous conditions could impact the Wednesday morning commute.</description>
<instruction>Monitor the latest forecasts for updates on this situation.
Persons should consider delaying all travel. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution. Consider taking a winter
storm kit along with you, including such items as tire chains,
booster cables, flashlight, shovel, blankets and extra clothing.
Also take water, a first aid kit, and anything else that would help
you survive in case you become stranded.</instruction>
