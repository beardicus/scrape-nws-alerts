<description>...Winter Storm Impacting The Area Tonight, Into Tuesday Night...
.A winter storm will bring impactful and hazardous winter weather
to the region late tonight into Tuesday night.
Snow spreads across parts of northeast Iowa and southwest
Wisconsin this evening, spreading northeast into southeast
Minnesota and western and central Wisconsin overnight.
By the Tuesday morning commute, 1 to 2 inch per hour snowfall
rates are likely across parts of northeast Iowa and southwest into
central Wisconsin. Early morning motorists should be prepared for

the Mississippi River by the evening. The bulk of the
accumulating snow will then exit into eastern Wisconsin by
midnight Tuesday.
In addition, northwest winds will increase with gusts 30 to
40 mph at times Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night. This will
result in blowing and drifting snow, especially across unsheltered
areas and along ridgetops.
