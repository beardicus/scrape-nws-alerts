<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued January 08 at 2:32AM PST until January 08 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM PST EARLY
THIS MORNING...
...HIGH SURF WARNING NOW IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM TUESDAY TO 4 PM PST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, Sneaker waves possible.
For the High Surf Warning, large waves and dangerous surf
conditions. Breakers up 28 to 35 feet likely.
* WHERE...In Oregon, North Oregon Coast and Central Oregon
Coast. In Washington, South Washington Coast.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, until 4 AM PST early
this morning. For the High Surf Warning, from 4 AM Tuesday to
4 PM PST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Destructive waves may wash over beaches, jetties, and
other structures unexpectedly. People can be swept off rocks and
jetties and drown while observing high surf. Severe beach
erosion may destroy coastal properties and buildings. Higher
than normal water run-up is expected on beaches and low-lying
shoreline.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Surfing, swimming, fishing, boating, and
observing large waves from rocks or coastal structures during
high surf conditions is dangerous. All large waves are not
alike. There is often an extra large breaker that can suddenly
sweep a person overboard or off a large rock with no warning.
The safest place to be during high surf conditions is in port
and well away from breaking waves.</description>
<instruction>A High Surf Warning means that high surf will affect beaches,
producing rip currents, sneaker waves and beach erosion. Stay
well back from the water`s edge and be alert for exceptionally
high waves.
Keep away from large logs on the beach. Water running up on the
beach can lift or roll logs which can injure or kill someone
caught in their path.
Remain out of the water to avoid hazardous swimming conditions.</instruction>
