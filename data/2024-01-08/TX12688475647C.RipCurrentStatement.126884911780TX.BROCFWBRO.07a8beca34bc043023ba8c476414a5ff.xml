<headline>Rip Current Statement issued January 08 at 12:47PM CST until January 09 at 6:00PM CST by NWS Brownsville</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH TUESDAY
AFTERNOON...
...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM CST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous south to north
longshore currents with embedded rips. For the Coastal Flood
Statement, isolated minor coastal flooding expected.
* WHERE...Kenedy Island, Willacy Island and Cameron Island
Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Tuesday
afternoon. For the Coastal Flood Statement, until 9 PM CST
this evening.
* IMPACTS...Wave run-up may approach the dunes along narrow
beaches. Beach equipment, such as umbrellas and chairs, could be
moved by waves. Vehicles driving along narrow beaches may
experience higher water levels. Elevated water levels may also
occur across the Laguna Madre and South Bay, and along State
Highway 4 west of Boca Chica State Park. Strong longshore
currents can move swimmers far away from their entry points, and
embedded rips can pull swimmers offshore at the same time.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Beach cameras on South Padre Island are
indicating a steady rise of water levels nearing the dune line
on the City Beaches. High tide, at 440 PM, is likely to coincide
with peak wave run-up which will reach the dunes at narrow
beaches and may edge to the dune line elsewhere. Conditions will
continue into the evening as predicted tides remain elevated,
even immediately after the cold front passes.</description>
<instruction>Move items behind the dune line to be safe. Potential swimmers are
urged to not enter the water today as the very rough surf and
strong currents are life-threatening.</instruction>
