<description>...SIGNIFICANT WINTER STORM TODAY INTO TUESDAY MORNING WITH BLIZZARD
CONDITIONS LIKELY AT TIMES...
...BLIZZARD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM THIS MORNING TO 9 AM CST
TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions and heavy snow expected. Total snow
accumulations mainly between 5 and 9 inches. North winds gusting
as high as 40 to 50 MPH starting this afternoon into this evening.
* WHERE...Portions of north central Kansas and south central
Nebraska, including the Tri Cities.
* WHEN...From 6 AM this morning to 9 AM CST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Widespread falling and
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility to around 1/4
mile at times, especially in open, rural areas. The hazardous
conditions could impact especially the Monday evening and Tuesday
morning commutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Precipitation could start as rain or sleet
this morning especially near and south of the Kansas border, but
should change to snow within a few hours. Although much of the
area will see moderate to heavy snow this morning, the strongest
winds and most likely time frame for blizzard conditions will not
begin until this afternoon into this evening, when north winds
increase and gust as high as 40 to 50 MPH. The majority of snow
will fall today into this evening, but lingering lighter snow and
strong winds will continue into Tuesday morning.</description>
<instruction>A Blizzard Warning means severe winter weather conditions are
expected or occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds
are likely. This will lead to whiteout conditions, making travel
extremely dangerous. Do not travel. If you must travel, have a
winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded, stay in your
vehicle.</instruction>
