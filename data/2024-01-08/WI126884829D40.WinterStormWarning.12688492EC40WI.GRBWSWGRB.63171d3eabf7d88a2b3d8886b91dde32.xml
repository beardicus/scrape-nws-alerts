<description>...HEAVY SNOW AND STRONG WINDS EXPECTED OVERNIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY
NIGHT...
.A strong winter system will move north into the Great Lakes late
tonight. Areas of freezing drizzle will precede the snow, resulting
in icy roads, especially over northern Wisconsin. Light snow will
overspread the region from south to north overnight into early
Tuesday. The snow should remain light in most areas through about
midday Tuesday, then become moderate to heavy through Tuesday
afternoon and early evening. The bulk of the accumulating snow will
fall Tuesday afternoon and evening. Wind gusts from the northeast to
north will also increase to 30 to 40 mph during the late afternoon
and evening, reducing visibility and resulting in patchy blowing and
drifting snow in open areas. The greatest accumulations are expected
in the eastern Fox Valley and lakeshore areas, where some lake
enhancement is anticipated. Hazardous travel conditions will
develop, with the worst conditions occurring during the afternoon
and early evening.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM TUESDAY TO 6 AM
CST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected, especially Tuesday afternoon and
evening. Total snow accumulations between 8 and 11 inches. Winds
gusting as high as 40 mph, resulting in patchy blowing and
drifting snow during the late afternoon and evening.
* WHERE...Calumet, Manitowoc, Brown, Door, and Kewaunee Counties.
* WHEN...From 3 AM Tuesday to 6 AM CST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous conditions
could impact the Tuesday morning and evening commutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The snow is generally expected to be light
overnight into Tuesday morning, with intensity picking up in the
afternoon.</description>
