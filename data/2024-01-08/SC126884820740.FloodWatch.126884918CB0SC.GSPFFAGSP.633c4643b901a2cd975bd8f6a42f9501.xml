<headline>Flood Watch issued January 08 at 8:28PM EST until January 09 at 10:00PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>.A strong low pressure system moving from the Plains overnight to
the Midwest on Tuesday will permit abundant Gulf moisture to stream
across the western Carolinas and northeast Georgia during the Flood
Watch period. The heavy rainfall will spread across the region
during the early morning hours, maximize atop the area Tuesday
morning through early afternoon, and then move east through Tuesday
evening. With rivers and streams still somewhat elevated from
previous heavy rainfall, flooding is expected to develop across the
region.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT EST TONIGHT THROUGH
TUESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of northeast Georgia, including the following
areas, Habersham, Rabun and Stephens; western North Carolina,
including the following areas, Polk, Rutherford, Henderson, Macon,
Southern Jackson and Transylvania; and Upstate South Carolina,
including the following areas, Central Greenville, Oconee,
Pickens, Greenville Mountains, and Northern Spartanburg Counties.
* WHEN...From midnight EST tonight through Tuesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A powerful low pressure system will spread heavy rain across
the region overnight through Tuesday. Rainfall amounts of 3
to 5 inches are expected throughout, while locations in the
southern-most parts of the North Carolina mountains near the
South Carolina border could see 6 inches. The threat of flash
flooding has increased given the recent rainfall in this
area.

<instruction>A Flood Watch for flash flooding means there is a potential for
rapid onset flooding based on current forecasts. Flash flooding is a
very dangerous situation and may impact areas that do not typically
flood. Please monitor the latest forecasts and be prepared to take
action quickly should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.
Rainfall of more than five inches in similar storms has been
associated with an increased risk of landslides and rockslides. If
you live on a mountainside or in a cove at the base of a mountain,
especially near a stream, be ready to leave in advance of the storm
or as quickly as possible should rising water, moving earth, or
rocks threaten. Consider postponing travel along mountain roads
during periods of heavy rainfall.</instruction>
