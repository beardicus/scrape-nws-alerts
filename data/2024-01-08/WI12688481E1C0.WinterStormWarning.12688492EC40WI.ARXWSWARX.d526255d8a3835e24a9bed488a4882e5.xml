<description>...Winter Storm Impacting The Area Tonight, Into Tuesday Night...
.A winter storm will bring impactful and hazardous winter weather

In addition, northwest winds will increase with gusts 30 to
40 mph at times Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night. This will
result in blowing and drifting snow, especially across unsheltered
areas and along ridgetops.
