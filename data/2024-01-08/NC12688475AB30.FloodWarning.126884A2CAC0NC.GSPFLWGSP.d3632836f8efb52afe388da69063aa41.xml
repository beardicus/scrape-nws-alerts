<headline>Flood Warning issued January 08 at 3:28PM EST until January 11 at 11:00AM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg SC has
issued a Flood Warning for the following rivers in North Carolina...
South Fork Catawba River At Lowell affecting Gaston County.
.A potent storm system is expected to produce 3-4 inches of rainfall
across the South Fork Catawba watershed from Tuesday morning through
Tuesday evening.  This rainfall will quickly overwhelm saturated
soils and result in excessive runoff and significant stream rises
across southeastern Burke County, Catawba County, Lincoln County,
and Gaston County, with several small tributaries of the SF Catawba
River possibly exceeding bankfull and causing nuisance to Minor
flooding of adjacent areas as early as late Tuesday morning.  This
excessive flow will cause the South Fork Catawba River near Lowell,
McAdenville, and Cramerton to exceed Minor Flood Stage early Tuesday
afternoon and possibly Moderate Flood Stage overnight Tuesday night
into Wednesday morning.  This will result in common, deeper flooding
of low-lying areas adjacent to the South Fork Catawba River with
lesser impacts to vulnerable property.  More significant inundation
with floodwaters approaching vulnerable buildings and property near
Cramerton is possible if the river exceeds Moderate Flood Stage.
Residents and business owners are advised to move vulnerable
property to higher ground and stay up-to-date by monitoring the
latest river levels and forecasts.

At 12.0 feet, Minor Flooding continues.  South Fork Catawba River
floodwaters may approach the Cramerton Fire Department building at
the intersection 8th Ave and 9th St.  The parking lot behind the
adjacent Cramerton Drug Company may be flooded.  Floodwaters may
approach one home along Riverside Dr. in Cramerton.
