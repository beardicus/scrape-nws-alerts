<description>...Snow Spreading In, Hazardous Travel Developing Overnight...
.Snow is moving north, northeast across northeast Iowa and
southwest Wisconsin late this evening, and will spread north of
Interstate 90 overnight. Roads will quickly become snow covered
and slippery after onset of the snow with visibilities falling
under 1 mile at times.
By the Tuesday morning commute, 1 to 2 inch per hour snowfall
rates are likely across parts of northeast Iowa and southwest
into central Wisconsin. Early morning motorists should be
prepared for slippery to hazardous travel, especially south of
Interstate 90.
The snow persists into Tuesday afternoon, gradually shifting east
of the Mississippi River by the evening. The bulk of the
accumulating snow will then exit into eastern Wisconsin by
midnight Tuesday.
In addition, northwest winds will increase with gusts 30 to
40 mph at times Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night. This will
result in blowing and drifting snow, especially across
unsheltered areas and along ridgetops.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM CST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow with accumulations of 8 to 11 inches. Winds
gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of northeast Iowa and central and southwest
Wisconsin.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM CST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Patchy
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. The
hazardous conditions will impact the Tuesday morning and evening
commutes.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
In Iowa, visit 511ia.org for road conditions. In Wisconsin,
visit 511wi.gov for road conditions.</instruction>
