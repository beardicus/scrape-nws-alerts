<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued January 08 at 3:39PM EST until January 10 at 1:00PM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM TUESDAY TO 1 PM EST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...1 to 2 ft of inundation above ground level expected in
vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline with the
Tuesday evening high tide cycle. 2 to 2 1/2 feet of inundation
above ground level expected in vulnerable areas near the
waterfront and shoreline with the Wednesday morning high tide
cycle. Locally 3 ft possible.
* WHERE...Northeast Suffolk, Southwest Suffolk, Southeast
Suffolk and Southern Nassau Counties.
* WHEN...From 4 PM Tuesday to 1 PM EST Wednesday.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Widespread moderate flooding of
vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline, particularly
Wednesday morning. Expect 2 to 2 1/2 ft, locally 3 feet of
inundation above ground level in low lying, vulnerable areas.
This will result in numerous road closures and cause widespread
flooding of low lying property including parking lots, parks,
lawns and homes/businesses with basements near the waterfront.
Vehicles parked in vulnerable areas near the waterfront will
likely become flooded. Flooding will also extend inland from the
waterfront along tidal rivers and bays.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...Large breaking waves of 15 to 20 ft along
the oceanfront will result in widespread dune erosion and damage
to dune structures. Scattered overwashes are expected, resulting
in some flooding of roadways and vulnerable structures behind
protective dunes. Isolated breaches or inundation of the barrier
island is possible where dune structures have been severely
compromised by previous storms.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Peak surge of 4 to 5 ft will likely be
between times of high tide Tuesday evening and Wednesday
morning. Tidal piling will likely inhibit the recession of water
before the Wednesday AM high tide, which could cause locally
major flooding for area from Freeport eastward. Of particular
concern are areas along the eastern Great South Bay from
Lindenhurst to Mastic and along the bay side of Fire Island,
where west to southwest gale winds may pile waters Wednesday
morning into afternoon along with 2 to 3 ft of wave action.
Residents in vulnerable communities should prepare for the
potential of major coastal flooding (3ft of inundation above
ground).
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
