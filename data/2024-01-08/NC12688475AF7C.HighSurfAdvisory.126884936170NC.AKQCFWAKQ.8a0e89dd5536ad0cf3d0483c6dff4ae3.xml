<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Large breaking waves will result in dangerous surf conditions and
possible beach erosion. Do not enter or approach the water due to
the risk of being swept away.</instruction>
