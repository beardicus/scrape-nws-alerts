<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 08 at 3:36AM CST until January 09 at 9:00AM CST by NWS Hastings</headline>
<description>...SIGNIFICANT WINTER STORM TODAY INTO TUESDAY MORNING WITH BLIZZARD
CONDITIONS LIKELY AT TIMES...
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM THIS MORNING TO
9 AM CST TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations mainly
between 6 and 10 inches, except for the Mitchell County Kansas
area where slightly lower amounts are favored. North winds gusting
as high as 35 to 45 MPH starting mainly late this afternoon into
tonight.
* WHERE...Portions of north central Kansas and central, east
central, and south central Nebraska.
* WHEN...From 6 AM this morning to 9 AM CST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Widespread falling and
eventually blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility to
around 1/2 mile at times, especially in open, rural areas,
creating near-blizzard conditions. The hazardous conditions could
impact especially the Monday evening and Tuesday morning commutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Precipitation could start as rain or sleet
this morning especially near and south of the Kansas border, but
should change to snow within a few hours for most areas. Although
much of the area will see moderate to heavy snow begin this
morning, the strongest winds and most likely time frame for
possible near-blizzard conditions will not occur until late this
afternoon into tonight, when north winds increase and gust as high
as 40 to 50 MPH. The majority of snow will fall today into this
evening, but lingering lighter snow and strong winds will continue
into Tuesday morning.</description>
