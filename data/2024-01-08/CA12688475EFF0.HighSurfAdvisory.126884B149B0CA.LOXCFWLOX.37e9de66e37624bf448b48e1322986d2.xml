FRIDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM TO NOON PST

* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 4 to
7 feet Wednesday and 6 to 8 feet with local max sets to 9 feet
Thursday. Dangerous rip currents are likely. Surf highest on

coastal flooding expected.
* WHERE...Ventura County Beaches.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, from 9 AM Wednesday to 3 AM
PST Friday. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 4 AM to noon

* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely, around the time of
high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as
parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to
roads or structures is NOT expected. There is an increased
risk for ocean drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers and
surfers out to sea. Large breaking waves can cause injury,
wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats
near shore.

be near 7.3 feet at around 830 AM.</description>

NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
