<description>...HEAVY SNOW AND STRONG WINDS EXPECTED OVERNIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY
NIGHT...
.A strong winter system will move north into the Great Lakes late
tonight. Areas of freezing drizzle will precede the snow, resulting
in icy roads, especially over northern Wisconsin. Light snow will
overspread the region from south to north overnight into early
Tuesday. The snow should remain light in most areas through about
midday Tuesday, then become moderate to heavy through Tuesday
afternoon and early evening. The bulk of the accumulating snow will
fall Tuesday afternoon and evening. Wind gusts from the northeast to
north will also increase to 30 to 40 mph during the late afternoon
and evening, reducing visibility and resulting in patchy blowing and
drifting snow in open areas. The greatest accumulations are expected
in the eastern Fox Valley and lakeshore areas, where some lake
enhancement is anticipated. Hazardous travel conditions will
develop, with the worst conditions occurring during the afternoon
and early evening.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM TUESDAY TO 6
AM CST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 3 and 6
inches.
* WHERE...Marathon, Langlade, Florence, Forest, and Northern
Marinette County Counties.
* WHEN...From 3 AM Tuesday to 6 AM CST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous conditions
could impact the Tuesday morning and evening commutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Freezing drizzle will occur before the snow
develops, so roads will be icy in spots.</description>

conditions for the state you are calling from can be obtained by
