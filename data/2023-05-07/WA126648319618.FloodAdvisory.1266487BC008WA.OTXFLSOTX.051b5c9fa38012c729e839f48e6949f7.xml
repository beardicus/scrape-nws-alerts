<instruction>Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.
Campers and hikers should avoid streams and creeks. River banks and
culverts can become unstable and unsafe. Flood water from mountain
snowmelt is cold and dangerous. Entering this fast flowing water can
cause cold water shock leading to loss of muscle function and onset
of hypothermia.</instruction>
