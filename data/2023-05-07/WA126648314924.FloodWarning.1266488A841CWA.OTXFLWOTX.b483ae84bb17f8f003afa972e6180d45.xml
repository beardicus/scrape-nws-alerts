<instruction>Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe. Flood water from mountain snowmelt is cold and
dangerous. Entering this fast flowing water can cause cold water
shock leading to loss of muscle function and onset of hypothermia.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. Campers and hikers should
avoid streams or creeks.</instruction>
