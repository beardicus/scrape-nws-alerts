<description>...Flood Potential Outlook for quick rises on rivers and streams in
the following counties in Oregon...Coos...Curry...Douglas...
A series of atmospheric rivers will bring heavy rain to the coast
and inland into Douglas County tonight through Sunday then again
Tuesday into Wednesday.
With the first system, rainfall amounts of 2 to 5 inches are
expected along the coast and into the coastal mountains through
Sunday, with around 1 to 3 inches across Douglas County. Lighter
rain is expected on Monday, followed by a second round of heavy rain
Tuesday and Wednesday, with similar amounts as the first system.
Heavy rain will result in rapid rises on areas streams and rivers.
For the Coquille at Coquille, the South Fork of the Coquille at
Myrtle Point and at Deer Creek at Roseburg there is a 30 percent
chance for the rivers to rise to bankfull and a 5 to 10 percent
chance for minor flooding, mainly as the second round of heavy rain
arrives Tuesday and Wednesday. For the Chetco River, there is a 10
percent chance for the river to rise to bankfull and less than 5
percent chance for minor flooding by Wednesday.
Additionally, ponding on area roadways, localized minor flooding in
low lying or flood prone areas, and localized rockfalls or
landslides are possible.
A flood potential outlook is issued when there is the potential for
significant rises or flooding along rivers and streams. The exact
scenario for flooding remains uncertain. This product will be
updated as necessary. Watches and warnings may be issued by the
National Weather Service if this situation worsens.</description>
