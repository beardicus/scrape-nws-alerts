<description>...POTENTIALLY IMPACTFUL ACCUMULATING SNOW NEXT WEEK...
With the next system on Monday into Tuesday, forecast guidance
continues to show the possibility of significant accumulating snow
for the Northern Lynn Canal area. Confidence in this outcome
continues to increase today as guidance points towards a longer
period of colder air remaining in place for the northern Lynn
Canal area. The main factor that would hinder the possibility of
accumulating snow right now is how fast does the warm air move up
Lynn Canal and reach the Haines and Skagway area. If this surge is
slower to move up the canal as guidance is continuing to point
towards, there is a chance that snow accumulations could be
greater than what is currently forecasted. If the warm air surge
happens faster than what model guidance is indicating, snow
accumulations will be limited and the area would see more rain
during this time. Stay tuned.
As always, the latest forecast information can be found at
