<description>...Winter Weather Advisories for Snow Accumulation Remain in Place
for Portions of the Northern Alaska Panhandle...
.A gale force low over the northeastern Gulf of Alaska continues
to push a front in across the Southeast Alaska Panhandle today.
This front will bring periods of heavier snowfall to several
locations, including Yakutat, Gustavus, Haines, Skagway and Juneau
where colder air is in place. The areas to see greatest amounts
of snowfall from 3 to 5 inches will be the Haines area and
Juneau, with Yakutat expected to switch back to rain for a period
of time this evening resulting in lower snow accumulation amounts.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM AKST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Snow. Total snow accumulations of 2 to 4 inches are
generally expected with some isolated higher amounts to 6 inches
possible. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...City and Borough of Juneau.
* WHEN...From 3 PM this afternoon to 6 AM AKST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be difficult overnight into Saturday
morning.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...It is possible that higher totals of
snowfall could be seen in the colder back areas of the
Mendenhall Valley and for higher elevations of Douglas in
localized areas. Most locations near the water and along the
larger highways will see significantly lower snow totals with
precipitation predominantly rain in warmer areas through the
evening hours before a changeover to snow takes place.</description>
