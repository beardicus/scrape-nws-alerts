Frequent cloud to ground lightning is occurring with these storms.
Lightning can strike 10 miles away from a thunderstorm. Seek a safe
shelter inside a building or vehicle.
These storms may intensify, so be certain to monitor local radio

are close enough to be struck by lightning. Move to safe shelter
now! Do not be caught on the water in a thunderstorm.</instruction>
