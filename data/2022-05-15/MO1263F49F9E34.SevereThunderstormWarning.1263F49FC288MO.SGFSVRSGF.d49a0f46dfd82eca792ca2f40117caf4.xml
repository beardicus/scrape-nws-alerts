Wind damage with these storms will occur before any rain or

SEEK SHELTER IMMEDIATELY inside a sturdy structure and stay away from
windows.
If on or near Table Rock Lake, get away from the water and move
indoors or inside a vehicle. Remember, lightning can strike out to
15 miles from the parent thunderstorm. If you can hear thunder, you
are close enough to be struck by lightning. Move to safe shelter
now! Do not be caught on the water in a thunderstorm.</instruction>
