<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued March 09 at 3:15AM AKST until March 10 at 9:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM THIS
EVENING TO 9 AM AKST THURSDAY FROM KIPNUK NORTH...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow accumulations of
up to one inch and ice accumulations up to one tenth of an inch.
Northeasterly winds 20 to 30 mph, gusting as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...Kuskokwim Delta from Kipnuk north.
* WHEN...From 6 PM this evening to 9 AM AKST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel may be difficult. Plan on slippery road
conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The combination of warm air and moisture
aloft moving over colder air near the surface will create the
potential for a band of freezing rain to develop. Freezing rain
is expected to begin in the northern Kuskokwim Delta this
evening and work southward, reaching its southern extent along a
line from Bethel to Kipnuk around midnight tonight. The freezing
rain is then expected to transition to snow from north to south
as temperatures aloft begin to cool. Freezing rain may persist
near Kipnuk into the morning Thursday, until precipitation
begins to taper off later in the day.</description>
