<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued March 09 at 2:39PM AKST until March 10 at 9:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM AKST
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow accumulations of
up to 4 inches and ice accumulations up to one tenth of an inch.
Northeast winds 25 to 35 mph, gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Kuskokwim Delta.
* WHEN...Until 9 AM AKST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel may be difficult. Plan on slippery road
conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Falling snow in combination with gusty
winds may reduce visibilities to as low as one quarter mile or
less at times through the early evening hours north of Toksook
Bay. There is then anticipated to be a lull in the activity
before another round of snow and blowing snow moves into the
area after midnight and into the morning hours Thursday. With
this second round of precipitation, some colder air is expected
to move in at the surface causing temperatures to cool for
places such as Bethel to Kipnuk to Toksook Bay while
temperatures aloft still remain warm. The combination of the
warm temperatures aloft and precipitation may allow for a
period of freezing rain for these areas especially after
midnight through Thursday morning. The dominant precipitation
type is expected to be snow as the warm nose is expected to
diminish rather quickly as colder air comes in but there exists
the threat for some freezing rain. All precipitation should come
to an end around 9 AM Thursday morning.</description>
