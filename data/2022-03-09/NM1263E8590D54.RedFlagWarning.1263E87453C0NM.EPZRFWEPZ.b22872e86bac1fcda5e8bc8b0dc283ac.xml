<description>...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
.An approaching weather system coming into the region from the
north will strengthen west to southwest flow over the area
Thursday afternoon. This will generate strong west-southwest
winds over the area. 20 foot wind speeds will be in the 20 to 25

relative humidity values across the lowlands west of the Rio
Grande in the lower to middle teens. These conditions will result
