.An approaching storm system will spread snow into the mountains and

uncertain. Snow amounts will be 2 to 6 inches in most areas, but up
to 18 inches in the higher mountains north of Berthoud Pass.
With snow beginning during the day today, driving conditions may
deteriorate substantially around rush hour this afternoon and
evening.
