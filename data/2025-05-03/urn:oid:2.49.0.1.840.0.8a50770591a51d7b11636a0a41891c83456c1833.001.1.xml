        <description>ESFAFC

As of approximately 19:30 AKDT Saturday, McGrath ice started running.
Water levels have risen but remain below the bank. Ice is very weak
and disintegrating as it moves. McGrath has no flood concerns at this
time.

As of approximately 20:30 AKDT Saturday, Stony River has ice running
past. Water levels have risen 3-4 ft and are expected to continue to
rise. Residents are not expecting the water level to reach airstrip
level. This ice run is more dense, with more water volume, a lot of
wood, and running faster than Thursday night. This ice run is most
likely ice from above Devils Elbow to near McGrath. Stony River has
no flood concerns at this time.

If runtime is similar to the Thursday ice run, then Sleetmute should
see this ice by mid-to-late morning Sunday.

The downstream flood potential remains low based on the very low
water levels and a lack of in-place river ice anywhere above Aniak.

At this time, the NWS urges residents in Stony River, Sleetmute, Red
Devil, and Crooked Creek to be prepared for rising water levels and
runs of ice through the evening into Monday morning.

NWS will continue to reach out to local community members for
observations and River Watch will fly the river as weather permits to
assess river conditions between Bethel and upstream of Crooked Creek
briefing communities along the way. To share any local observations,
please email anchorage.weather@noaa.gov.
