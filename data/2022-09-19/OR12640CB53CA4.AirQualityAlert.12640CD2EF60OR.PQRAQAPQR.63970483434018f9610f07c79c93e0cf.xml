<headline>Air Quality Alert issued September 19 at 4:37PM PDT  by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...AIR QUALITY ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 AM PDT WEDNESDAY...
Lane Regional Air Protection Agency has issued an Air Quality
Advisory, which is in effect until 11 AM PDT Wednesday.
In Eugene and Springfield, air quality of “unhealthy for sensitive
groups” is expected in the mornings with improved air quality each
afternoon.
In Oakridge, air quality is likely to worsen to “hazardous” on the
Air Quality Index.
Young children, older adults, and people with heart or lung problems
are especially vulnerable. With school back in session, it is
important to consider public health guidance for school outdoor
activities when scheduling time outdoors for children.
Pollutants in smoke can cause burning eyes, runny nose, aggravate
heart and lung diseases, and aggravate other serious health
problems. Limit outdoor activities and keep children indoors if it
is smoky. Please follow medical advice if you have a heart or lung
condition.
