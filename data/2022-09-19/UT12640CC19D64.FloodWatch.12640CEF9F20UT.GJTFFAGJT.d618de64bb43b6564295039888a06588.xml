<headline>Flood Watch issued September 19 at 10:49PM MDT  by NWS GrandJunction</headline>
<description>.An anomalous plume of moisture will move into the forecast area on
Tuesday and last until early Friday. Additionally, a system moving
through the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies will aid in the
development of widespread showers and thunderstorms. These storms
will be capable of producing heavy rainfall and cell training could
lead to flash flooding. Long periods of light to moderate rain could
also cause flooding issues. Event rainfall totals could exceed 1 to
3 inches along I-70 and points south, and 0.25 to 1 inches up north.
Steep terrain, burn scars and slot canyons will be the most
susceptible to flooding issues. Burn scars included in the Watch
area include the Grizzly Creek Fire as well as the Pack Creek and
Pine Gulch Fires and other smaller burn scars.
