<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Minor flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know
where you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can
become killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid
streams or creeks.</instruction>
