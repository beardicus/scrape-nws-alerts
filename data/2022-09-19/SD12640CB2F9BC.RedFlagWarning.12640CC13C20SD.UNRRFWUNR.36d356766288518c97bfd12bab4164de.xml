<headline>Red Flag Warning issued September 19 at 2:55AM MDT until September 19 at 8:00PM MDT by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>.Unseasonably warm temperatures are expected today. Minimum
relative humidity will be around 15 percent for much of the
area...with portions of northeast Wyoming and southwest South
Dakota dropping to near 10 percent. Deep boundary layer mixing
will result in gusty west-southwest winds this afternoon/early
evening. Wind gusts over 30 mph are possible for much of northeast
Wyoming and southwest South Dakota. While winds decrease this
evening, relative humidity will be slow to recover this evening/tonight;
maximum relative for areas around the Black Hills will be 45
percent or less. A cold front slides through the area
tonight/early Tuesday with a period of gusty northwest winds
behind the front.
