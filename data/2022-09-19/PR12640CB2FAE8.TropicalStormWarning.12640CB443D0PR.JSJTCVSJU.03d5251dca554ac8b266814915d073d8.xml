banks in many places with deep moving water. Small streams,
creeks, canals, arroyos, and ditches may become raging

valleys while increasing susceptibility to rockslides and
mudslides. Flood control systems and barriers may become
stressed.

communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or
washed away. Numerous places where flood waters may cover
