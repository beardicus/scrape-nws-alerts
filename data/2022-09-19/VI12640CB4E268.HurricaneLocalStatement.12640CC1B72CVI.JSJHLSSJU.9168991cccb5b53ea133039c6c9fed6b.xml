**TROPICAL STORM DISCONTINUED FOR PUERTO RICO**
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- All watches and warnings have been canceled
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 210 miles west-northwest of Aguadilla PR or about 210
miles northwest of Mayaguez PR

SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Fiona is currently located north of the Dominican Republic.
However, Fiona`s rain bands will continue to impact Puerto Rico as it
lifts northwards. Periods of torrential rains are therefore expected
to continue affecting the territory, creating life threatening flash
flood conditions, overflowing rivers and small streams and debris
flow. Additional heavy rains tonight will only aggravate the already
flooded areas and will trigger mudslides and rockfall due to the
unstable soil. Trailing moisture is expected to continue to affect the
region especially Puerto Rico at least through Tuesday or into
Wednesday.
Since the risk of winds have diminished, the tropical storm warning
for Puerto Rico was discontinued. Marine conditions should gradually
improve as well, but hazardous seas will prevail for the offshore
Atlantic waters. Additionally, life-threatening rip currents will
prevail across the local beaches at least into tomorrow.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Additional impacts from flooding rain are still a concern across Puerto
Rico. Remain well guarded against life-threatening flood waters having
further impacts of extensive potential. Additional 4 to 8 inches
expected across Puerto Rico.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Do not return to evacuated areas until it is safe. Listen for the all-
clear signal from local authorities.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Do not attempt to return to evacuated areas until local authorities
give the All-Clear signal.
Do not go sightseeing within impacted communities simply to observe
storm damage. Sightseers can interfere with the timeliness of
rescuers and first responders to needlessly jeopardize lives.
When inspecting damage, use flashlights rather than candles or flamed
lighting. Be aware of sparks that can ignite leaking gas or other
flammables.
Do not go up on your roof until the rain and strong winds have
subsided. Ladders can be slippery in the rain and unexpected wind
gusts can blow you off of the roof. Do not risk bodily harm in an
attempt to reduce property damage.
When clearing out fallen trees, be careful with chain saws and axes.
Always wear protective gear and keep others at a safe distance. Use
these tools according to operating manuals and safety instruction.
Leaning trees and those which have fallen on roof tops can be
especially challenging. If you are not in good health or unsure about
what you are doing, have someone else with tree cutting experience do
the job. Never cut trees without a partner.
If using a generator, avoid carbon monoxide poisoning by following
instructions by the manufacturer. Make sure that the generator is run
in a well ventilated space.
Problems with sewer backups can further contaminate standing flood
waters. Keep children away. Also, listen for boil water alerts
relative to communities whose tap water may have become non-potable.
