<description>...HEAVY RAINFALL AND LIFE THREATENING TO CATASTROPHIC FLOODING
EXPECTED ACROSS MUCH OF PUERTO RICO...
Tropical storm conditions will continue to affect portions of Puerto
Rico through most of the day, as rainbands from Hurricane Fiona will
lift northwards across the forecast area. These rainbands will bring
additional heavy rains and thunderstorms which will aggravate the
already saturated and flooded areas...especially along western,
southern and the interior sections of Puerto Rico. The loose soil
will also continue to trigger mudslides and rockfall in areas of
steep terrain.
...FLOOD WATCH NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH TUESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall will continue
to be possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands, including the
following areas, in Puerto Rico, Central Interior, Culebra,
Eastern Interior, Mayaguez and Vicinity, North Central, Northeast,
Northwest, Ponce and Vicinity, San Juan and Vicinity, Southeast,
Southwest, Vieques and Western Interior. In Virgin Islands, St
Croix and St.Thomas...St. John...and Adjacent Islands.
* WHEN...Through Tuesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rainbands from Hurricane Fiona will continue to move across
Puerto Rico. Sections of Puerto Rico already received 10 to
25 inches of rain. Additional amounts between 3 to 6 inches with
local maximum of 10 inches especially for southern Puerto Rico.
Catastrophic flooding continues in some areas, with episodes of
flash flooding expected to continue through Tuesday.
