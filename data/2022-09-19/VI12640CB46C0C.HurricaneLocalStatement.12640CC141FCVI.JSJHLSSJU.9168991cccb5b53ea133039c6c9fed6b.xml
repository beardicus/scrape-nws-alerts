<description>This product covers Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands
**RAIN FROM FIONA STILL AFFECTING PUERTO RICO**
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for all of Puerto Rico,
including Vieques and Culebra.
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 170 miles west-northwest of Aguadilla PR or about 180
miles west-northwest of Mayaguez PR
- 19.6N 69.5W
- Storm Intensity 90 mph
- Movement Northwest or 315 degrees at 9 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Fiona was now located near the northern coast of the
Dominican Republic. However, Fiona`s rain bands will continue to
impact Puerto Rico as it lifts northwards. Periods of torrential rains
are therefore expected to continue affecting the territory, creating
catastrophic and life threatening flash flood conditions, overflowing
rivers and small streams and debris flow. Additional heavy rains today
will only aggravate the already flooded areas and will trigger
mudslides and rockfall due to the unstable soil. Trailing moisture is
expected to continue to affect the region especially Puerto Rico at
least through Tuesday or into Wednesday.
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Puerto Rico, as well as for
the local waters until later today.
Rough and hazardous marine and coastal conditions are also expected to
persist. Squally conditions with seas at 12 to 15 feet across the Mona
Passage and Atlantic Offshore waters, elsewhere between 5 and 10 feet.
Seas will slowly subside during the afternoon and into the evening
hours. Expect winds of 25 to 45 knots with higher gusts accompanying
the rainbands.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
the region. Remain well guarded against life-threatening flood waters
having possible devastating impacts. If realized, these impacts
include:
- Extreme rainfall flooding may prompt numerous evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may overwhelmingly overflow their banks
in many places with deep moving water. Small streams, creeks,
canals, arroyos, and ditches may become raging rivers. In
mountain areas, deadly runoff may rage down valleys while
increasing susceptibility to rockslides and mudslides. Flood
control systems and barriers may become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter numerous structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Numerous places where flood waters may cover escape
routes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of raging water
with underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become very
dangerous. Numerous road and bridge closures with some weakened
or washed out.
Protect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
significant to extensive impacts across the entire area.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Do not return to evacuated areas until hazardous winds diminish and
flood waters abate.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to remain safely sheltered from the storm. Stay inside
and away from windows. Listen for updates and be ready in case you
lose electrical power. Locate your battery powered radio and flashlight
from your Emergency Supplies Kit. Keep these items close.
Do not venture outside while in the eye of a hurricane. Within the
eye, weather conditions may temporarily improve which can be
misleading. Once the eye passes, the wind will change direction and
return to dangerous speeds. Heavy rain will also return. Be smart and
remain safely hidden from the storm.
Do not be a thrill seeker or risk your life for senseless photos or
videos. Be wise and avoid becoming another statistic.
Be ready to move to the identified safe room if your home or shelter
begins to fail. Quickly move to an interior room on the lowest floor.
Put as many sturdy walls between you and the storm as you can.
Protect your head and body.
