        <headline>High Surf Advisory issued August 21 at 2:04AM EDT until August 22 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Upton NY</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, life-threatening rip
currents. For the High Surf Advisory, breaking waves building
to 9 to 13 feet through tonight, subsiding to 5 to 9
feet by Friday afternoon. For the Coastal Flood Warning, 2 to
2 1/2 feet of inundation above ground level expected in
vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline. For the
first and second Coastal Flood Advisories, up to 1 1/2 ft of
inundation above ground level expected.

* WHERE...Southern Queens County.

* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT Friday. For
the High Rip Current Risk, through Friday evening. For the
Coastal Flood Warning, from 5 PM today to 1 AM EDT Friday.
For the first Coastal Flood Advisory, from 5 AM to 1 PM EDT
Friday. For the second Coastal Flood Advisory, from 6 PM
Friday to 2 AM EDT Saturday.

* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Widespread moderate flooding of
vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline with
this evening's high tide. Expect 2 to 2 1/2 ft of
inundation above ground level in low lying, vulnerable areas.
This will result in numerous road closures and cause
widespread flooding of low lying property including parking
lots, parks, lawns and homes/businesses with basements near
the waterfront. Vehicles parked in vulnerable areas near the
waterfront will likely become flooded.

* SWIMMING IMPACTS...Life-threatening swimming and surfing
conditions and localized beach erosion. Life-threatening rip
currents are likely for all people entering the surf zone.
Anyone visiting the beaches should stay out of the surf. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water.

* SHORELINE IMPACTS...The threat for beach flooding and beach
erosion will increase with successive high tides thru Fri
morning. Scattered areas of dune erosion are likely during the
Thu eve and Fri morning high tides.

        <instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.

Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.

If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
