        <headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued August 21 at 4:55AM EDT until August 22 at 1:00AM EDT by NWS Upton NY</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, life-threatening rip
currents. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves
building to 12 to 16 ft through tonight, subsiding to and 8 to
12 feet on Friday afternoon. For the Coastal Flood Warning, 2
to 2 1/2 feet of inundation above ground level expected in
vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline. For the
first and second Coastal Flood Advisories, 1 to 2 ft of
inundation above ground level likely.

* WHERE...Southwest Suffolk and Southern Nassau Counties.

* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT Friday. For
the High Rip Current Risk, through Friday evening. For the
Coastal Flood Warning, from 5 PM today to 1 AM EDT Friday. For
the first Coastal Flood Advisory, from 5 AM to 1 PM EDT
Friday. For the second Coastal Flood Advisory, from 6 PM
Friday to 2 AM EDT Saturday.

* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Widespread moderate flooding of
vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline with this
evening's high tide. Expect 2 to 2 1/2 ft of inundation above
ground level in low lying, vulnerable areas. This will result
in numerous road closures and cause widespread flooding of low
lying property including parking lots, parks, lawns and
homes/businesses with basements near the waterfront. Vehicles
parked in vulnerable areas near the waterfront will likely
become flooded.

* SWIMMING IMPACTS...Life-threatening swimming and surfing
conditions and localized beach erosion. Life-threatening rip
currents are likely for all people entering the surf zone.
Anyone visiting the beaches should stay out of the surf. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water.

* SHORELINE IMPACTS...The threat for dune erosion and beach
flooding will increase with successive high tides thru Fri
morning. Widespread areas of dune erosion with localized
overwashes are expected during the Thu evening and Fri morning
high tides.

        <instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.

Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.

If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
