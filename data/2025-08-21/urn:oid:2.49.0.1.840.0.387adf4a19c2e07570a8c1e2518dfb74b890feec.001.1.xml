SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------

Not much change with regards to hurricane Erin this morning as the
system remains a powerful Category 2 hurricane. Erin has begun to
pull away from Eastern North Carolina and the Outer Banks, but given
the large wind field from the system, significant coastal impacts
are expected to continue today, particularly on the Outer Banks and
adjacent waters, as Erin slowly pulls away to the northeast.

Moderate to significant storm surge inundation of 2 to 4 feet above
ground level is expected to continue along the oceanside north of
Cape Lookout, resulting in a significant threat to life and
property. The worst impacts will likely be felt along the Outer
Banks on Ocracoke and Hatteras Island. Portions of NC-12 and
secondary roads along the Outer Banks, in particular on Hatteras and
Ocracoke Islands, are already closed and will likely remain
impassable or inaccessible through much of this week due to
significant ocean overwash.

Minor to locally moderate inundation of 1 to 3 ft can also be
expected for soundside areas adjacent to the southern Pamlico Sound
today and possibly into Friday as well. Now that we have passed this
mornings high tide, we once again expect potential impacts around
the high tide cycle this evening, when the higher of the daily
tides is expected.

Strong rip currents are expected along area beaches through the
weekend. Extensive beach erosion is also likely due to strong long
period waves as high as 10 to 18 feet in the surf zone, highest on
the Outer Banks.

Very dangerous marine conditions will continue for the coastal
waters, sounds and rivers, with gusty winds and dangerous seas.
This will create treacherous conditions for mariners.

POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------

* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across
the Outer Banks from Duck to Cape Lookout. Remain well away from
life-threatening surge having additional significant impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.

Also, minor to locally moderate soundside inundation with water level
rises of 1 to 3 feet across the southern Pamlico Sound and adjacent
tributaries due to the north winds. Highest water levels expected
across Downeast Carteret County today. Remain well away from locally
hazardous surge having additional limited impacts.

Elsewhere across Eastern North Carolina, little to no impact is
anticipated.

* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
the Outer Banks southward to Cape Lookout, and adjacent coastal communities
on Pamlico and Albemarle Sound. Remain well sheltered from hazardous
wind having additional limited impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.

Elsewhere across Eastern North Carolina, little to no impact is
anticipated.

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------

* EVACUATIONS:
Follow the advice of local officials.

* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to stay inside and away from windows. Listen for
updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Keep a
battery-powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.

Keep your cell phone charged and in power-saving mode. If you lose
power, use it sparingly and mainly for personal emergencies and
check-ins.

Do not be a thrill seeker or risk your life for senseless photos or
videos.

Quickly move to the safest place within your shelter if it begins to
fail, preferably an interior room on the lowest floor as long as
flooding is not a concern.

If you are prone to flooding or in an area under a storm surge watch
or warning, be prepared for the possibility of a quick and dramatic
rise in water levels.
