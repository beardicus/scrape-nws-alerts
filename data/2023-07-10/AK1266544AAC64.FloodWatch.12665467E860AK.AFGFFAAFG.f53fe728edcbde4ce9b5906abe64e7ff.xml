* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Including the following area, Eastern Beaufort Sea Coast.
* WHEN...Through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers and
low-lying and flood-prone locations including the Hula Hula River.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Significant rainfall Friday night and Saturday in the
Northeast Brooks Range has caused rises in rivers draining
north to the Arctic Ocean. This may cause flooding along
rivers today. It is expected that the high water will move
down river to the coast today, and that rivers will start to
fall tonight.
