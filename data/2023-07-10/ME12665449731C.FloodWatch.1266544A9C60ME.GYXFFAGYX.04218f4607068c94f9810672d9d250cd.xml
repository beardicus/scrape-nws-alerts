<headline>Flood Watch issued July 10 at 2:39AM EDT until July 10 at 10:00AM EDT by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of western Maine, including the following areas,
Interior Cumberland Highlands, Northern Franklin, Northern Oxford,
Southern Franklin and Southern Oxford.
* WHEN...Through Tuesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Slow moving low pressure will track from the Mid-Atlantic
north into New England through tonight. This system will
produce lines of slow moving showers and thunderstorms which
could produce torrential downpours and lead to flash
flooding. The threat is exacerbated by the fact that the
ground is already saturated from recent rainfall events.
Also, rivers in the area could reach flood stage today or
tonight.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor the latest forecast and be prepared to take
action should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.</instruction>
