- Slow moving low pressure will track from the Mid-Atlantic
north into New England through tonight. This system will
produce lines of slow moving showers and thunderstorms which
could produce torrential downpours and lead to flash
flooding. The threat is exacerbated by the fact that the
ground is already saturated from recent rainfall events.
Also, rivers in the area could reach flood stage today or
tonight.</description>
