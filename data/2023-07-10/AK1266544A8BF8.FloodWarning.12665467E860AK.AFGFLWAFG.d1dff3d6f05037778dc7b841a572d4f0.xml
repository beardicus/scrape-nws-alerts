Sagavanirktok Rivers.
* WHEN...Until 1000 PM AKDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 555 AM AKDT Monday,river gage reports on the Sagavanirktok
River near Pump Station 3 indicates that flooding is
occuring, but that the river crest has moved downstream of
Sagwon. Flooding is likely along the Anaktuvuk, Nanushuk,
Itkillik, Kuparuk, and Toolik Rivers as they have similar
headwaters to the Atigun and Sagavanirtok Rivers. Between 2
and 3 inches of rain fell between Atigun Pass and Sagwon from
Friday night through Saturday night.
- The Atigun River appears to have the highest summer water
level on record when it crested Sunday morning. The
Sagavanirktok River Gage near Pump Station 3 crested at minor
flood stage Sunday morning and has fallen since then. This
high water could threaten the Dalton Highway in areas where
the highway runs along the Sagavanirtok River. The high water
will move out of the area by late tonight.
- For Sagavanirktok River near Pump Station 3:
At 5:45am the stage was 18.91 feet.
Flood Stage is 20.0 feet.
