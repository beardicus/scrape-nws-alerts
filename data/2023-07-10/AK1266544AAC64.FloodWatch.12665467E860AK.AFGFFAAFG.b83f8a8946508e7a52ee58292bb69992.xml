through Saturday night dropped 2 to 3 inches of rain between
Atigun Pass and Sagwon. This caused rapid rises on all rivers
draining north from the Brooks Range. The Sagavanirtok River
had minor flooding near Pump Station 3 on Sunday, but is now
falling. This high water is now moving away from the
mountains and is expected to reach the coast later today.
Water levels are now falling near the mountains, and water
levels will fall downstream  late tonight. A flood warning is
in effect today for all rivers from the Sagavanirtok River
west. Rivers east of the Sagavanirtok River may be flooded as
well.

possibility of flooding along larger rivers further way from the
mountains on today.</description>
