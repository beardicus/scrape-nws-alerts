<description>...SNOW INCREASING AGAIN IN THE MOUNTAINS...
...DANGEROUSLY COLD ON THE PLAINS THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING...

tonight in the northern Colorado mountains. Winds will also increase

continue into Monday, then diminish as the day goes on. Light snow
will spread across eastern Colorado Monday morning.
Dangerously cold temperatures and wind chills will also continue.
The coldest temperatures will be Monday night into Tuesday morning.

inches. Winds gusting as high as 60 mph.
* WHERE...Rabbit Ears Pass, Rocky Mountain National Park and the
Medicine Bow Range, and The Mountains of Summit County, the
Mosquito Range, and the Indian Peaks.
* WHEN...Until 5 PM MST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel may become very difficult to impossible due to
heavy snowfall and widespread blowing snow. Road closures are
likely. Travel could be very difficult to impossible.</description>
<instruction>Consider delaying travel across the mountains if possible. Check the
latest road conditions and closures by calling 5 1 1 or by going to
www.cotrip.org.
If travel is absolutely necessary, drive with extreme caution and be
prepared for sudden changes in visibility. Leave plenty of room
between you and the motorist ahead of you, and allow extra time to
reach your destination. Avoid sudden braking or acceleration, and be
especially cautious on hills or when making turns. Make sure your
car is winterized and in good working order.</instruction>
