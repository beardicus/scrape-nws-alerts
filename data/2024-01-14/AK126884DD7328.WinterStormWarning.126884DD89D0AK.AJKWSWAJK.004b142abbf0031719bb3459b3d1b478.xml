<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 14 at 3:42PM AKST until January 14 at 4:00PM AKST by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...LONG DURATION SNOW EVENT FOR THIS WEEKEND...
.As a system positions itself across the northern gulf, moisture
is being steered into the Panhandle, with widespread
precipitation enveloping the north and central areas. Through the
day warmer temperatures have penetrated inland, with many
observation sites rising a few degrees, with this warming trend
continuing into Monday afternoon. Expect snow ratios to drop as
snow becomes wetter and heavier. As the front moves southeast
Monday afternoon it will bring accumulating snowfall to the
southern Panhandle.
For the north, expecting accumulating snowfall to end sometime
Monday night, with clearing moving north to south through the day
Tuesday.
...WINTER STORM WARNING WILL EXPIRE AT 4 PM AKST THIS AFTERNOON...
Warmer temperatures are expected to slide into the area, allowing
snow to transition to rain.</description>
