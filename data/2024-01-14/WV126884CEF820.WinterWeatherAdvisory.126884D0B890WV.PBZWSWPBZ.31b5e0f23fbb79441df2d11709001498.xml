<instruction>Use caution while traveling outside. Wear appropriate clothing, a
hat, and gloves.
Persons are urged to stay indoors until conditions improve. If you
must go outside, dress in layers. Several layers of clothes will
keep you warmer than a single heavy coat. Cover exposed skin to
reduce your risk of frostbite or hypothermia. Gloves, a scarf, and a
hat will keep you from losing your body heat.
Be prepared for slippery roads. Slow down and use caution while
driving. If you are going outside, watch your first few steps taken
on stairs, sidewalks, and driveways. These surfaces could be icy and
slippery, increasing your risk of a fall and injury.
Please report snow or ice accumulations by calling 412-262-1988,
posting to the NWS Pittsburgh Facebook page, or using Twitter
@NWSPittsburgh.</instruction>
