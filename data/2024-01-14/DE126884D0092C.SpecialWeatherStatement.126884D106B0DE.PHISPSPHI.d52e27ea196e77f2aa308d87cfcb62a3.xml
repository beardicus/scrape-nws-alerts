<description>...DANGEROUS SNOW SQUALLS TO IMPACT THE REGION LATE THIS MORNING
INTO THE AFTERNOON HOURS...
One or more bands of snow squalls will be moving east at 50 to 55
mph along the leading edge of an arctic airmass, with the
potential to impact portions of eastern Pennsylvania and adjacent
areas of New Jersey and northern Delaware.
Near whiteout conditions and a quick one half inch of snow in just
10 to 15 minutes will lead to dangerous travel conditions as a
result of the very poor visibility and snow or ice covered roads.
Winds will gust up to 50 mph in the squalls.
If possible, delay any travel until the mid to late afternoon
hours. If you are traveling, your recognition of these squalls
and the actions you take to get off the road or help to gradually
slow traffic could prevent a high speed, multi-vehicle accident
and save your life and the lives of others.
If you see terrain features and objects off in the distance being
obscured by heavy snow within the dangerous snow squalls, take
quick action to pull off the road to a safe location, such as a
parking lot or driveway to wait out the squall.
If you are on an interstate, it`s best to get off the road at the
nearest exit as soon as you notice the squall to ensure the
safety of you and your passengers. If there isn`t an opportunity
to safely exit the interstate, slow down gradually, well before
entering the squall and turn on your flashing hazard lights.</description>
