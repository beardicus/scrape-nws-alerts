<description>...MODERATE TO HEAVY SNOW WILL AFFECT GARRETT COUNTY...
At 716 AM EST, an area of moderate to heavy snow is located around
Grantsville to Mountain Lake Park and points north and west,
including Interstate 68 across all of Garrett County.
Winds in excess of 40 mph are expected with the snow, which will
cause blowing and drifting snow. Visibility will be reduced to below
one-quarter mile at times, and untreated surfaces will be snow
covered and slippery. Please use extra caution when travelling this
morning.
Locations impacted include...
Mountain Lake Park, Oakland, Bayard, Bittinger, Grantsville, Loch
Lynn Heights, Friendsville, Deer Park, Accident, Redhouse, Hutton,
Gorman, Jennings, Deep Creek Lake State Park, Crellin, Swallow Falls
State Park, McHenry, Big Run State Park, Piney Grove, and McComas
Beach.
This includes Interstate 68 in Maryland between mile markers 1 and
29.
Icy roads are possible as the snow melts on the roads then quickly
refreezes.</description>
