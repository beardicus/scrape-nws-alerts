<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1130 AM EST FOR
SOUTHEASTERN CARBON AND CENTRAL MONROE COUNTIES...
At 1059 AM EST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from Monticello to near White Haven, moving northeast at 75
mph.
HAZARD...Intense bursts of heavy snow. Gusty winds leading to
blowing snow and rapidly falling visibility. Wind gusts
greater than 35 mph.
SOURCE...Radar and webcams.
IMPACT...Dangerous and life-threatening travel conditions are
expected to develop rapidly in the warning area.
This includes the following highways...
Northeast Extension between mile markers 72 and 82.
Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania between mile markers 301 and 314.
Interstate 80 in New Jersey near mile marker 0.
Locations impacted include...
Lehighton, East Stroudsburg, Palmerton, Jim Thorpe, Stormville,
Henryville, Brodheadsville, New Mahoning, Kunkletown, Werry Lake,
Gilbert, Delaware Water Gap, Tannersville, Alpine Mountain, Rossland,

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.
Serious injuries and deaths may result from people exiting their
vehicles during a snow squall. Drivers may not be able to see you or
stop! If you have been involved in an accident or pulled to the side
of the roadway, quickly exit your vehicle and move as far away from
the roadway as possible ONLY when it is safe to do so. Do not stand
along or near the roadway, since approaching vehicles may be unable
to maintain control.
