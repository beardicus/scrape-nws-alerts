PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Reduce speed and turn on headlights! During snow squalls, the
visibility may suddenly drop to near zero in whiteout conditions.
There is no safe place on a highway when a snow squall hits.
Visibility and traction are immediately lost in whiteout conditions,
making it difficult or impossible to slow down and avoid stopped
vehicles. Delay travel or safely exit the highway before the snow
squall arrives.
