<headline>Snow Squall Warning issued January 14 at 6:42AM EST until January 14 at 8:00AM EST by NWS State College</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in State College PA has issued a
* Snow Squall Warning for...
North central Cambria County in central Pennsylvania...
Southeastern Cameron County in north central Pennsylvania...
Clearfield County in central Pennsylvania...
Southeastern Elk County in north central Pennsylvania...
* Until 800 AM EST.
* At 642 AM EST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from Force to near Punxsutawney to near Delmont, moving
east at 25 mph.
HAZARD...Intense bursts of heavy snow. Gusty winds leading to
blowing snow and visibility rapidly falling to less than
one-quarter mile. Wind gusts greater than 50 mph could
knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured objects.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Dangerous and life-threatening travel conditions are
expected to develop rapidly in the warning area.
For those driving on Interstate 80, this includes areas between the
Dubois and Kylertown exits, specifically from mile markers 97 to 127.
Locations impacted include...
DuBois, Clearfield, Sandy, Northern Cambria, Woodland, Curwensville,
Patton, Penfield, Hyde, Hastings, Plymptonville, and Rockton.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
There is no safe place on a highway when a snow squall hits.
Visibility and traction are immediately lost in whiteout conditions,
making it difficult or impossible to slow down and avoid stopped
vehicles. Delay travel or safely exit the highway before the snow
squall arrives.
Serious injuries and deaths may result from people exiting their
vehicles during a snow squall. Drivers may not be able to see you or
stop! If you have been involved in an accident or pulled to the side
of the roadway, quickly exit your vehicle and move as far away from
the roadway as possible ONLY when it is safe to do so. Do not stand
along or near the roadway, since approaching vehicles may be unable
to maintain control.
