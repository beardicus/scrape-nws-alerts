<description>...Slick Roads and Bitterly Cold Temperatures Tonight...
Snow accumulations have generally been an inch or less along and
north of a line from Perryville MO to Illinois Route 13 in
southern Illinois to the Ohio River bordering southwest Indiana
and northwest Kentucky tonight. Even so, roadways will be very
slick through the rest of the night and into Monday morning given
the bitterly cold temperatures in place. As a result, you are
advised to slow down and use extra caution while traveling tonight
and early Monday.
Additionally, temperatures will remain in the single digits
through the rest of the night, with morning lows from around zero
to 5 degrees expected. This will result in wind chill values from
zero to around 10 below. Dress warmly in layers and ensure you
have an emergency supply kit in case your vehicle breaks down in
the extremely cold weather.</description>
