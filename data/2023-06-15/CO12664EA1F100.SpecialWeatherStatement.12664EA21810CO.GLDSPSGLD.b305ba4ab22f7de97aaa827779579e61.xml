<description>...Brief Landspout Tornadoes Possible...
At 159 PM MDT, conditions are becoming favorable for the development
of landspout tornadoes in and close to the western and central
portions of Yuma and Kit Carson Counties in Colorado. However, at
this time it is unknown which if any storm would produce a
landspout. Any tornadoes which develop are expected to pose a
limited threat.
Locations impacted include...
Yuma, Wray, Flagler, Seibert, Eckley, Vona and Abarr.
Landspout tornadoes can form with a developing thunderstorm before
rain, hail, and even thunder is observed. Landspout tornadoes are not
usually associated with a wall cloud and are often difficult to
detect with weather radar.
