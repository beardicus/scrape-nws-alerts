<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded mountain roads.

Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where

their banks as snowmelt increases. Campers and hikers should avoid
streams or creeks, which can become dangerous to cross due to fast
