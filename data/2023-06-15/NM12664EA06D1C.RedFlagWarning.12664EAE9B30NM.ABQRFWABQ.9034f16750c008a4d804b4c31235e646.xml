<headline>Red Flag Warning issued June 15 at 4:07AM MDT until June 15 at 9:00PM MDT by NWS Albuquerque</headline>
<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM NOON TO 9 PM TODAY FOR
PORTIONS OF CENTRAL AND EAST-CENTRAL NEW MEXICO DUE TO VERY LOW
HUMIDITY, STRONG WINDS, AND AN UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FOR FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND EARLY
EVENING ACROSS SOUTHWESTERN, WEST CENTRAL, CENTRAL, AND PORTIONS
OF NORTHEASTERN NEW MEXICO DUE TO VERY LOW HUMIDITY, STRONG WINDS
AND AN UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
.An upper level trough approaching from the west will spread
stronger west southwest winds over much of central and eastern
New Mexico this afternoon. The combination of rising temperatures,
very low humidity, strong winds, and an unstable airmass will
produce critical fire weather conditions. Single-digit humidities
will last 6 to 12 hours for portions of the Middle Rio Grande
Valley.
Another round of strong winds is expected to develop Friday
afternoon ahead of an additional upper level disturbance. This
will create the potential for additional critical fire weather, as
dry and unstable conditions will persist on Friday.
Any fires that develop over the next few days will have the
potential for significant growth in receptive fuel beds.
