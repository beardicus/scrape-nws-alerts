<headline>Flood Warning issued June 15 at 2:54PM AKDT  by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AKDT FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt continues.
* WHERE...Sagavanirktok River near Dalton Highway from Mileposts 401
to 407.
* WHEN...Until 600 PM AKDT Friday.
* IMPACTS...Flood waters are eroding the Dalton Highway between
Milepost 401 and 407, with the road down to one lane. If
conditions worsen, the road may wash out and become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 230 PM AKDT Thursday, the Sagavanirktok River continues to
flow overbank due to remnant ice in the main channel. This is
forcing the water to flow west and cause erosion along the
Dalton Highway from Milepost 401 to 407. These conditions are
expected to persist until ice in the main channel clears.
- Rain falling in the headwaters of the Sagavanirktok River
earlier this week is expected move down river through Friday.
This will result in high water levels on the Sagavanirktok
River from near Pump Station 3 to the coast into Friday.
