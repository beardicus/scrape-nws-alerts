<headline>Special Weather Statement issued June 15 at 1:33PM MDT  by NWS Pueblo</headline>
<description>...THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE IN PUEBLO HAS ISSUED A SPECIAL
WEATHER STATEMENT FOR...
Northeastern Pueblo County in southeastern Colorado...
A weather system over Colorado will favor the development of showers
or thunderstorms and weak funnel clouds for the next few hours.
These weak funnels can extend thousands of feet down from the base of
the parent cloud, and typically last for only a few minutes then
dissipate.  However,on rare occasions, they can briefly reach the
ground and cause minor damage.
If you are in Colorado, be alert for the possibility of seeing a
funnel cloud, and if you do, call your local law enforcement agency,
and they will relay your report to the national weather service.  If
you are a weather spotter for the national weather service in pueblo,
please call our office directly if you spot a funnel cloud.
If a funnel cloud comes close to the ground near you, go to a place
of safety, preferably in a sturdy building.</description>
