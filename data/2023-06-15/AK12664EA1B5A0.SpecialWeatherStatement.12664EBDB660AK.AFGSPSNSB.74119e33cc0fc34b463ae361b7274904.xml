<description>...High Water Levels Expected This Week...
Rain continues over the northeast Brooks Range east of the Dalton
Highway. Rainfall totals of 1 to 1.5 inches have fallen from
Monday evening through early Wednesday afternoon. Additional
rainfall up to one third of an inch is expected through Thursday
night. Runoff from this rainfall and melting of the remaining
snowpack will cause rivers draining the northeast Brooks Range to
rise to bankfull levels in some locations through Friday. This
includes the Canning, Hulahula, Okpilak and Kongakut Rivers. The
high water will cover gravel bars and cause increased erosion in
some locations. People recreating along these rivers are
encouraged to monitor water levels. Water levels will also rise on
the Sag River, but remain below bankfull.</description>
