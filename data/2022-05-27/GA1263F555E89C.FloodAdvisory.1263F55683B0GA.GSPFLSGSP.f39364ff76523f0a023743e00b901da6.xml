- At 700 AM EDT, High levels of runoff throughout the advised
area will continue this morning, especially in parts of the
Little Tennessee, Nantahala and Chattooga basins.
Significant flows will continue along the larger streams in
this area, causing elevated flows and out-of-bank conditions
to persist.  Residents along the Tallulah River below Lake
Burton, especially below Mathis Dam need to remain alert for
potential reservoir releases due to very high flows feeding
Lake Burton.  If significant releases occur, a Flash Flood
Warning may be needed.  Please stay weather aware.
