<headline>Red Flag Warning issued May 27 at 5:48AM CDT until May 28 at 9:00PM CDT by NWS El Paso</headline>
<description>...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED ON SATURDAY AND
SUNDAY...
.An approaching upper level system will create stronger west to
southwest winds Saturday and Sunday afternoons. Winds look to
become gusty in the higher terrain locations as stronger winds
aloft move over the area, especially over the Gila Region and
Sacramento Mountains. Afternoon humidity values will remain in the
single digits through the weekend as well, with overnight
humidity recoveries struggling to make it over 30%. A very dry
spring has led to extremely dry fuels over much of southern New
Mexico and far west Texas. These critical fire weather conditions
are expected to persist through the holiday weekend; with winds
strengthening in the afternoon hours, afternoon humidity values
remaining extremely dry, and overnight humidity recoveries hardly
reaching 30%.

LOW HUMIDITIES AND STRONG WINDS FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONES 055, 056,
