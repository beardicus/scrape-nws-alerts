<headline>Air Quality Alert issued May 27 at 6:54PM MDT  by NWS El Paso</headline>
<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM MDT SATURDAY...
The New Mexico Departments of Health and Environment has issued an
Air Quality Alert, until 1 PM MDT Saturday.
An Air Quality Alert for Smoke has been issued.
* WHAT... Smoke from the largest fires in the state will generally be
transported toward the east or northeast throughout the remainder
of the afternoon and evening. Weaker inversions and steadily
increasing winds near ridgetop level from the southwest tonight
will generally disrupt typical nighttime drainage patterns as
observed the past two nights. The most impactful smoke should
remain closer to the fire`s perimeters as compared to this past
morning. Exceptions will be portions of the Mimbres and Lower Rio
Grande Valley as well as the Upper Pecos and Gallinas watersheds
where locally significant down valley impacts may be observed.
Strengthening southwest winds on Saturday and excellent dispersion
will quickly loft the most significant smoke plumes toward the
northeast and higher in the atmosphere. Haze will likely be more
noticeable and persistent away from the larger fires and areas of
blowing dust will contribute to diminished air quality at times in
the afternoon and evening. In addition to air quality concerns,
record or near-record heat will be common for much of the area.
A reminder, temperatures will be very high in the mid to upper-90s in
areas of the state. According to the CDC the following groups are at
greater risk for experiencing heat-related illness:
-Infants and young children
-People over 65 years of age or older
-People who are overweight
-People who overexert during work or exercise
-People who are physically ill, especially with heart disease or
high blood pressure, or who take certain medications, such as
for depression, insomnia, or poor circulation.
If you have adult neighbors, relatives, or friends who fit into any
of these categories, consider checking in with them a couple of times
a day during high heat events. Also, monitor infants and young
children for sign of heat-related illness. You can find out more
here https://nmtracking.doh.nm.gov/health/climate/Heatillness.html
* WHERE... The most significant impacts from smoke are expected to
persist across much of Catron, western Socorro County, northern
Grant, northern Luna and western Sierra counties in southwest New
Mexico and western San Miguel and western Mora counties in north-
central New Mexico. More details on impacted locations and latest
air quality information can be found at https://fire.airnow.gov
* WHEN... Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1pm MDT
Saturday, May 28
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method available
at https://nmtracking.doh.nm.gov/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
