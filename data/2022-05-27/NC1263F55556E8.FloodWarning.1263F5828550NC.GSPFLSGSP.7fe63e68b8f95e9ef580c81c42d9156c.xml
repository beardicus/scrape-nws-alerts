<headline>Flood Warning issued May 27 at 3:30AM EDT until May 29 at 11:40PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in North
Carolina...
French Broad River At Blantyre affecting Henderson and
Transylvania Counties.
.Heavy rainfall has ended across the upper French Broad River
watershed with 3-7 inches of storm-total accumulations since
Thursday morning.  This has resulted in significant rises along the
French Broad River from Rosman to Brevard to Blantyre to Etowah and
as the floodwave works downstream from Rosman and Brevard, river
levels are expected to exceed Minor Flood Stage later this morning
and reach 17.5-18.5 feet near Blantyre into Saturday.  This will
cause widespread Minor flooding along the French Broad River,
producing significant inundation of common, flood-prone areas within
the valley.
...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT FROM THIS MORNING TO LATE SUNDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...French Broad River At Blantyre.
* WHEN...From this morning to late Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...At 17.0 feet, Minor Flooding continues.  Floodwaters
continue to inundate farmland between the French Broad River and
the railroad tracks. Floodwaters may start to inundate the
shoulders of River Road near the Big Willow Road intersection.
Floodwaters continue to impact boat access areas at Grove Bridge
Rd. and Crab Creek Rd.
At 18.0 feet, Minor Flooding continues. Widespread farmland
flooding between the French Broad River and the railroad tracks is
ongoing. The intersection of River Rd. and Big Willow Rd. is
inundated with several inches of water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 2:30 AM EDT Friday the stage was 14.8 feet and rising
steadily.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above Minor Flood
Stage this morning to a crest of between 17.5 and 18.5 feet
tomorrow morning. It will then fall below Minor Flood Stage
late Sunday morning.

<instruction>Motorists should not attempt to drive around barricades or drive
cars through flooded areas.
Even 6 inches of fast-moving flood water can knock you off your feet
and a depth of 2 feet will float your car. Never try to walk, swim,
or drive through such swift water. If you come upon flood waters,
stop, turn around and go another way.
