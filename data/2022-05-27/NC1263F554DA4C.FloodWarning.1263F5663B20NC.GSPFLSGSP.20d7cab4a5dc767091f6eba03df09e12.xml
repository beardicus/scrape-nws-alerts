<headline>Flood Warning issued May 27 at 12:11AM EDT until May 28 at 2:00PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in North
Carolina...
Tuckasegee River At Bryson City affecting Swain County.
.Significant flows are being released from the reservoirs in the
east and west forks of the Tuckasegee River in southern Jackson
County.  This flow continues to increase due to recent gate openings
at Lake Glenville and further rises along the Tuckasegee River are
expected over the next several hours.  Additional heavy rainfall is
possible overnight tonight and may exacerbate ongoing rises.
Therefore, the Tuckasegee River at Bryson City is expected to
continue rising over the next several hours, and will at least
exceed 11-12 feet.  However, more significant rises, possibly
reaching 13 feet, are possible into the early overnight hours.
Residents and campers along the Tuckasegee River from Whittier to
Bryson City are urged to find higher ground before the river rises
to dangerous levels and monitor the latest river levels and
forecasts for the latest information.  Please heed all guidance from
Swain County Emergency Management.
