<description>...FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM CDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt is occurring. Namakan
Lake has already surpassed the level reached in the 2014 flood and
is continuing to rise. Rainy Lake rose above the 2014 level May
23rd.
* WHERE...Rivers and lakes within the Rainy River Basin including
Crane Lake, Namakan Lake, Kabetogama Lake and Rainy Lake.
* WHEN...Flooding is occurring now and is expected to continue.
* IMPACTS...Strong lake level rises are ongoing.  Flooding continues
and lake levels have yet to crest. Expect high water continuing
for the next several weeks.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 303 PM CDT, Emergency management reported ongoing
flooding.
- Multiple rounds of thunderstorms are expected this weekend
into next week. Basin average rainfall amounts of one to
three inches are forecast. Locally higher amounts are
possible, but remain uncertain and will depend on where
thunderstorms track over multiple days.
Lake levels on Namakan Lake and Kabetogama Lake are expected
to rise an additional 2 to 5 inches between May 27 and June
3. There is uncertainty due to the precipitation forecast.
Lake Levels on Namakan and Kabetogama may level off over the
next week if precipitation amounts are on the low-end of the
forecast. However, if precipitation amounts are on the high
end, Namakan Lake could continue to rise through next week
and approach the record level set in 1916 of 1122.8 ft
For Rainy Lake, a rise of 11 to 13 inches is expected between
May 27 and June 3, with continued rises through at least mid
June. At this rate, Rainy Lake is expected to break the all-
time record high level of 1112.95 ft set in 1950 sometime
next week.
Some locations that will experience flooding include Rainer,
Island View, Voyageurs National Park, Crane Lake and
Kabetogama Lake.

<instruction>Use extreme caution if venturing our on these water bodies as many
hazards exist.
In addition to rising levels, any thunderstorms that produce strong
winds could cause larger waves on these lakes, which could further
cause damage on the shoreline.
Once levels have peaked, it will take a long time (weeks) for levels
to decline back to anything close to normal summer levels.</instruction>
