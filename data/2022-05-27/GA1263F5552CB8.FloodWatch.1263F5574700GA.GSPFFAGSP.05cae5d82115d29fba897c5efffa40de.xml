<headline>Flood Watch issued May 27 at 2:22AM EDT until May 27 at 4:00PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON EDT TODAY...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...Portions of northeast Georgia, western North Carolina and
Upstate South Carolina, including the following areas, in
northeast Georgia, Habersham and Rabun. In western North Carolina,
Avery, Buncombe, Burke Mountains, Caldwell Mountains, Eastern
McDowell, Eastern Polk, Graham, Greater Burke, Greater Caldwell,
Greater Rutherford, Haywood, Henderson, Macon, Madison, McDowell
Mountains, Mitchell, Northern Jackson, Polk Mountains, Rutherford
Mountains, Southern Jackson, Swain, Transylvania and Yancey. In
Upstate South Carolina, Greenville Mountains, Oconee Mountains and
Pickens Mountains.
* WHEN...Until Noon EDT today.
* IMPACTS...Ongoing flooding continues in many southern North
Carolina mountain communities. Additional heavy rainfall at rates
of one-quarter to one-half inch per hour, combined with excessive
runoff from earlier rainfall, may result in further flooding of
rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone
locations. Area creeks and streams are already running high and
could easily flood with any more heavy rainfall.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Many parts of the watch area have received 2 to 5 inches of
rain in the past 24 hours, with a few locations in the
southern mountains already above 6 inches. Areas of moderate
to heavy rain showers with embedded thunderstorms will
continue and additional flooding may develop while ongoing
flooding worsens. An additional inch or two of rainfall will
be possible through daybreak in the most prone locations to
southerly upslope flow.

<instruction>Rainfall of more than five inches in similar storms has been
associated with an increased risk of landslides and rockslides. If
you live on a mountainside or in a cove at the base of a mountain,
especially near a stream, be ready to leave in advance of the storm
or as quickly as possible should rising water, moving earth, or
rocks threaten. Consider postponing travel along mountain roads
during periods of heavy rainfall.</instruction>
