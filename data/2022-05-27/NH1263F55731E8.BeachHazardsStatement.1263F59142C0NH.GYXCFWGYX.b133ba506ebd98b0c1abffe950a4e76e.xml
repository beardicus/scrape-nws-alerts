<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued May 27 at 3:46PM EDT until May 30 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY MORNING
THROUGH MONDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Please check with state and local authorities regarding
guidelines for allowed activities. The warm air temperatures in
the upper 60s to around 80 this weekend may cause people to
underestimate the dangers of the cold water temperatures which
are currently only in the lower 50s.
* WHERE...In New Hampshire, Coastal Rockingham County. In Maine,
Coastal York, Coastal Cumberland, Sagadahoc, Lincoln, Knox and
Coastal Waldo Counties.
* WHEN...From Saturday morning through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...The cold water temperatures can quickly cause
hypothermia to anyone immersed in the water. When the water
temperature is below 60 degrees, the average submerged person
could lose dexterity within minutes and be unable to accomplish
simple tasks. Anyone on boats or paddlecraft should use extreme
caution to avoid this threat.</description>
<instruction>A Beach Hazards Statement is issued on days when a significant
number of boats and paddlecraft are expected to be out on the
water and when warm air temperatures may cause people to
underestimate the danger of the cold water. Paddle smart from the
start. Always wear your life jacket. Be aware of wind conditions,
tides, and localized currents.</instruction>
