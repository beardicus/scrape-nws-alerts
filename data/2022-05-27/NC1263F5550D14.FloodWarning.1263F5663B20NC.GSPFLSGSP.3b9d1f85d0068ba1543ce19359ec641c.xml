<headline>Flood Warning issued May 27 at 1:41AM EDT until May 28 at 2:00PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM EDT EARLY THIS
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...Transylvania County, North Carolina
* WHEN...Until 400 AM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding along the French Broad River from Rosman
to Brevard to Etowah to Blantyre will continue for at least the
next several hours, impacting common, flood-prone roadways, boat
access areas, farmland, and other areas adjacent to streams.
Additional, nuisance flooding will continue to develop along the
Davidson River and the Little River as well through the overnight
hours.
* The French Broad River at Rosman is now on its third rise of the
night and has exceeded the Minor Flood Stage of 9.0 feet once
again.  The river is expected to continue to rise to near 10.5
feet over the next 1-2 hours before attempting another crest and
beginning another recession.  If additional heavy rainfall
develops, Rosman may approach 11-12 feet and if so, a new Flash
Flood Warning will be issued to highlight this threat for a new
round of more significant flooding.  Please stay weather aware
through the overnight hours until the heavy rain threat ends later
Friday morning.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 119 AM EDT, A new area of heavy rain developed over the
past few hours over western Transylvania County, producing
1-2 inches of accumulation from Rosman west towards Lake
Toxaway.  This has exacerbated ongoing high stream flows and
may have caused a few areas of new flooding.  While this
latest heavy rain has ended, streams across the area remain
high and several remain out of their banks, continuing to
flood low-lying areas.  The French Broad River at Rosman has
returned to Minor Flood Stage, and may rise up to one foot
higher than earlier crests.  The Davidson River and Little
River continue to rise between Action Stage and Minor Flood
Stage.  Therefore, the Flood Warning will be allowed to
continue for several more hours.
Be aware that additional heavy rainfall remains possible into
the early morning hours.  This rainfall may be significant
and produce new rounds of flash flooding.  Due to elevated
stream flows, there is the potential for more significant
flash flooding tonight.  New Flash Flood Warnings may be
issued.  Therefore, residents and campers in the area from
Lake Toxaway to Balsam Grove to Rosman, Pisgah Forest,
Brevard, and Etowah need to be prepared to seek higher ground
immediately.  Flash flooding may develop quickly and give you
little time to evacuate.  Do not wait for a Flash Flood
Warning to take action once heavy rain begins.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Brevard, Rosman, Gorges State Park, Dupont State Forest,
Balsam Grove, Connestee, Wolf Mountain, Sapphire, Penrose,
Cedar Mountain, Little River In Transylvania County and North
Transylvania.</description>
<instruction>In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
