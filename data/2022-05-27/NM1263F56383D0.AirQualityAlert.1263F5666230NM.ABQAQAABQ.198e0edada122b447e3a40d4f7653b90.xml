<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT...
The following message is transmitted at the request of the New Mexico
Departments of Health and Environment, United States Forest Service
and the Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality Response Program.
* WHAT...Smoke from the largest fires in the state will generally be
transported toward the east or northeast through the remainder of
the afternoon and evening. Weaker inversions and steadily increasing
winds near ridgetop level from the southwest tonight will generally
disrupt typical nighttime drainage patterns as observed the past two
nights. The most impactful smoke should remain closer to the fire`s
perimeters as compared to this past evening. Exceptions will be
portions of the Mimbres and Lower Rio Grande valleys as well as the
Upper Pecos and Gallinas watersheds where locally significant down
valley impacts may be observed. Strengthening southwest winds on
Saturday and excellent dispersion will quickly loft the most
significant smoke plumes toward the northeast and higher in the
atmosphere. Haze will likely be more noticeable and persistent away
from the larger fires and areas of blowing dust will contribute to
diminished air quality at times in the afternoon and evening. In
addition to air quality concerns, record to near-record heat will be
common for much of the area.
* WHERE...The most significant impacts from smoke are expected to
persist across much of Catron, western Socorro, northern Grant,
northern Luna, and western Sierra counties in southwest New Mexico
and western San Miguel and western Mora counties in north-central
New Mexico. More details on impacted locations and latest air
quality information can be found at https://fire.airnow.gov.
* WHEN...Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1 pm MDT,
Saturday, May 28, 2022.
* IMPACTS...Those with conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and heart
disease will be especially vulnerable to impacts from poor air
quality, as will adults over age 65, young children, and pregnant
women if smoke concentrations become unhealthy.
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method available
at https://nmtracking.doh.nm.gov/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
A reminder, temperatures will be very high in the mid to upper 90s in
areas of the state. According to the CDC the following groups are at
greater risk for experiencing heat-related illness: Infants and young
children, people 65 years of age or older, people who are overweight,
people who overexert during work or exercise, people who are
physically ill, especially with heart disease or high blood pressure,
or who take certain medications, such as for depression, insomnia, or
poor circulation.
If you have adult neighbors, relatives, or friends who fit into any of
these categories, consider checking on them a couple times a day
during high heat events. Also, monitor infants and young children for
signs of heat-related illness. You can find out more here
https://nmtracking.doh.nm.gov/health/climate/HeatIl
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
https://nmtracking.doh.nm.gov/environment/air/IndoorQuality.html and
https://cv.nmhealth.org
New Mexicans will also need to take steps to keep their homes cool to
avoid heat-related illnesses. NMDOH offers tips here:
