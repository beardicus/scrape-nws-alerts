<headline>Flood Advisory issued May 27 at 3:46AM EDT until May 28 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM EDT THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Nuisance flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...southern Haywood County, North Carolina
* WHEN...Until 800 AM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
including farmland, boat-access areas, and low-water crossings.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 341 AM EDT, Earlier heavy rainfall has ended across
southern Haywood County.  However, the east and west forks of
the Pigeon River remain elevated and after two earlier
crests, these tributaries are rising once again near bankfull
levels.  This will be the final rise for these streams and
crests will occur over the next 1-2 hours before a final
recession begins.  In the meantime, both the east and west
forks of the Pigeon River will briefly exceed their banks,
causing nuisance flooding of adjacent low-lying areas,
including farmland, boat-access areas, and low-water
crossings.  The Flood Advisory will therefore be extended
into later this morning to allow these streams to recede back
below critical levels.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Sunburst and Cruso.</description>
<instruction>Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
