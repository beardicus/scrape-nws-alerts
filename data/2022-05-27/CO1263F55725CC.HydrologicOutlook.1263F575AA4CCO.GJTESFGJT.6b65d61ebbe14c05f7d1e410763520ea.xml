<description>...Increased Flows on the Green River Below Flaming Gorge
Reservoir Due to Releases...
Releases from Flaming Gorge Reservoir continue at full power plant
and full bypass today and are scheduled to last until June 2 before
starting to ramp down. Water levels below the reservoir will remain
around bankfull.
Anyone planning to recreate on area waterways should maintain
awareness and use an abundance of caution in or near the water. The
water will be much colder, run high and swift.
Additionally, the Yampa River will increase later this week and
increase flows especially below the confluence with the Green River.
River levels near Jensen, UT are forecast to be slightly over
bankfull by early next week.
Agriculture should take appropriate action to move or secure
equipment near the river.
Weather and reservoir release adjustments can change the flows on
the Green River. Please monitor river conditions if your are
recreating on, working near or traveling to the Green River below
Flaming Gorge Reservoir.</description>
