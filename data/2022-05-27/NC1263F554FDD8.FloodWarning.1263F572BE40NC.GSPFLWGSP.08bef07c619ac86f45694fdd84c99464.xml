<headline>Flood Warning issued May 27 at 1:02AM EDT until May 28 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 1245 PM EDT THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Jackson County, North Carolina.
* WHEN...Until 1245 PM EDT Friday.
* IMPACTS...Areas along the Tuckasegee River downstream from the
confluence near NC 107 and NC 281 to Cullowhee to Webster to
Dillsboro to Whittier will continue to see rises and Minor to
Moderate flooding.  Meanwhile, isolated Minor flooding will
continue over the next couple of hours along the east and west
forks of the Tuckasegee headwaters before these smaller streams
finally begin to crest and recede.  Moderate flooding is defined
as significant flooding of flood-prone, low-lying areas adjacent
to streams including farmland, campgrounds, greenways, parks, and
boat-access areas.  Additionally, some structural flooding is
expected, including homes that are immediately adjacent to streams.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1248 AM EDT, Heavy rainfall had ended earlier across
Jackson County, but a new round of moderate rain is entering
the county and may persist for the next 1-2 hours before
another lull occurs.  Storm-total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches
was observed across the county, with the heaviest rain across
the southern third of the county over the headwaters of the
Tuckasegee River.
Unusually high flows continue to impact the reservoirs of the
east and west forks of the Tuckasegee River and these high
flows are continuing to cause significant rises along the
Tuckasegee River.  This is resulting in widespread Minor to
isolated Moderate flooding within the valley and this
flooding is expected to continue for several more hours
before the floodwave moves downstream into Swain County and
conditions gradually improve by Friday morning.
However, since the original flash flood threat has ended, the
Flash Flood Warning has been cancelled and replaced with a
Flood Warning.  This does not mean significant flood threat
has ended, rather that the flooding has persisted for several
hours past the causative heavy rain event, allowing smaller
streams to crest and recede and focusing all significant
flood concerns along the mainstem Tuckasegee River.
Several vulnerable mobile homes along Fred Smith Road near
the community of Tuckasegee reported floodwaters 3-4 feet
deep and evacuations were needed this evening.  A campground
along Tunnel Mountain Rd is currently experiencing
significant inundation as well.  Additional impacts are
likely to develop downstream including additional significant
flooding.  Residents and other persons near the Tuckasegee
River need to be prepared to heed any evacuation orders or
other guidance from Jackson County Emergency Management and
seek higher ground if the river continues to rise.
- Yet another around of additional rainfall of 1-2 inches is
possible between 2am and 5am this morning before the heavy
rain threat finally ends later tonight.  This will prolong
ongoing flooding and may cause new areas of flooding to
develop.  Locally heavier rainfall is possible and new Flash
Flood Warnings may be needed.  It will be critically
important to stay weather aware and be prepared to seek
higher ground if new flash flooding develops.
- Some locations that will continue to experience flash
flooding include...
Sylva, Cherokee, Cullowhee, Webster, Dillsboro, Cashiers,
Lake Glenville, Tuckasegee, Savannah, and Whittier.</description>
<instruction>Please heed all messages and evacuation orders from Jackson County
Emergency Management officials.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles. Obey all barricades and find alternative
routes to stay alive.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.</instruction>
