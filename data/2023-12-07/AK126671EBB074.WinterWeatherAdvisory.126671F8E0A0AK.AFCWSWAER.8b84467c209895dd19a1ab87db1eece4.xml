<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 07 at 2:57PM AKST until December 08 at 1:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM AKST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 2 to 5 inches
for Anchorage Bowl. Total snow accumulations of 4 to 8 inches
for the Anchorage Hillside. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph
along Turnagain Arm and the Anchorage Hillside.
* WHERE...Anchorage.
* WHEN...Until 1 AM AKST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Areas of light snow will develop by late
this afternoon. Snow may become heavy, falling at the rate of
inch per hour, around the time of the evening commute. The
combination of snowfall rates, the dry nature of the snow
resuspended by vehicular travel, and the gusty winds along
Turnagain Arm and the Anchorage Hillside may significantly
reduce visibility to as low as one half mile at times. The snow
is expected to become lighter in intensity tonight before
tapering off overnight.</description>
