<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 07 at 9:51PM AKST until December 08 at 1:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM AKST
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Snow and blowing snow expected. Total snow
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches for the Anchorage Bowl. Total
snow accumulations of 6 to 10 inches for the Anchorage
Hillside. South winds gusting as high as 25 mph across the
Anchorage Bowl.
* WHERE...Anchorage.
* WHEN...Until 1 AM AKST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Areas of moderate to heavy snow will
continue through late this evening. The combination of
snowfall rates of up to an inch per hour, the dry nature of
the snow resuspended by vehicular travel, and the gusty south
winds may significantly reduce visibility to as low as one
half mile at times. The snow is expected to become lighter in
intensity tonight before slowly tapering off Friday morning.</description>
