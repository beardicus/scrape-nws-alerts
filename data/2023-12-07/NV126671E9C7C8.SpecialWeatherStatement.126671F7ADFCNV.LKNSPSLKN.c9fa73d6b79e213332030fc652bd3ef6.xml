<description>...Multiple weather disturbances to bring colder temperatures,
snow showers, and gusty winds...
A weather disturbance will bring wetter weather across and north
of the US Highway 50 corridor today. Breezy to locally windy west
to southwest winds 15 to 25 mph with gusts to 35 mph are possible.
In addition, colder air will be over the area with highs in the
30s to low 40s with a mix of light rain and snow showers today,
with a changeover to all snow tonight. Limited accumulations of
less than a half inch is expected in the valleys with one to two
inches in the mountains.
A stronger weather feature will bring better chances for
accumulating snow to valleys across central and northeastern
Nevada late tonight through Friday morning. Snow amounts of one
half inch with isolated areas of 2 inches are expected.
Probability of greater than 2 inches (greater than 70%) is
concentrated around the northern Elko county mountains, areas
adjacent to the Ruby mountains and along I-80 between Elko and
Wells. Since snow is expected overnight, potential for some
impacts on roadways increases, particularly by Friday morning.
Drier conditions return for Friday evening before light snow
showers arrives to northern Nevada for the weekend. Much colder
temperatures are expected Saturday morning with readings in the
single digits to teens.
