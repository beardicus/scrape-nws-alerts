<description>...AIR QUALITY HEALTH ADVISORY FOR WILDFIRE SMOKE FROM 900 AM
FRIDAY UNTIL 900 AM SATURDAY...
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has
issued the following...
WHAT...Air Quality Health Advisory for Wildfire Smoke.
WHERE...Hinsdale, Mineral and Archuleta Counties. Locations
include, but are not limited to Lake City, Creede and Pagosa
Springs.
WHEN...900 AM Friday August 11 to 900 AM Saturday August 12
IMPACTS...The Bear Creek and Quartz Ridge wildfires will produce
moderate to heavy smoke Thursday morning for parts of Archuleta
and southern portions of Mineral and Hinsdale Counties. This smoke
will decrease by late Friday morning as atmospheric mixing
increases. By Friday afternoon, showers and thunderstorms with
gusty, erratic winds could send smoke in any direction. By late
Friday night, moderate to heavy smoke from the Bear Creek and Dry
Lake fires will drain from Weminuche Creek in southern Hinsdale
County southward into the Piedra area. Additionally, the Quartz
Ridge wildfire in eastern Archuleta County could produce moderate
to heavy smoke overnight for locations along East Fork Road
westward to Highway 160 north of Pagosa Springs.
HEALTH INFORMATION...Public Health Recommendations: If smoke is
thick or becomes thick in your neighborhood you may want to remain
indoors. This is especially true for those with heart disease,
respiratory illnesses, the very young, and the elderly. Consider
limiting outdoor activity when moderate to heavy smoke is present.
Consider relocating temporarily if smoke is present indoors and is
making you ill. If visibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in
your neighborhood, smoke has reached levels that are unhealthy.</description>
