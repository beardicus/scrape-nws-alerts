<description>...A Strong Storm Moves Through the Panhandle This Weekend...
A gale force low with a significant source of subtropical
moisture will enter the Gulf of Alaska Saturday. Heaviest
rainfall is expected Saturday afternoon and into the evening. By
Sunday, the plume of moisture will shift away from Juneau allowing
for diminishing precipitation. For those along the Mendenhall
River, the rainy and windy conditions could increase the risk of
trees falling into and around the river from the already unstable
river banks.
Estimates show widespread 2 to 3 inches of rain is expected to
fall from Saturday morning to early Sunday morning. From the this
heavy precipitation, expect to see rapid rises in small rivers and
creeks but at this time they will remain within their banks.
This front will also bring windy conditions to Southeast
communities. Sustained winds between 15 to 25 mph with periods of
high gusts to 30 to 40 mph are likely. Expected the strongest
winds Saturday afternoon.</description>
