<headline>Excessive Heat Warning issued August 11 at 4:56AM AST until August 11 at 4:00PM AST by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...EXCESSIVE HEAT WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM THIS MORNING TO
4 PM AST THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Heat index values exceeding 112 degrees Fahrenheit.
* WHERE...Lower elevations and urban areas from the north central
westward across the northwest and southward across western Puerto
Rico, Vieques, Culebra, and the US Virgin Islands.
* WHEN...From 10 AM this morning to 4 PM AST this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Long period of exposure could likely lead to heat
exhaustion or heat stroke</description>
<instruction>Take extra precautions, if you work or spend time outside. When
possible, reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear light weight and loose fitting clothing when
possible and drink plenty of water.
To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent rest
breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone overcome
by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location. Heat
stroke is an emergency, call 9 1 1.
An Excessive Heat Warning means that a prolonged period of
dangerously hot temperatures will occur. The combination of hot
temperatures and high humidity will combine to create a DANGEROUS
SITUATION in which heat illnesses are likely. Drink plenty of
fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out of the sun, and
check up on relatives and neighbors.
Young children and pets should never be left unattended in
vehicles under any circumstances. This is especially true during
warm or hot weather when car interiors can reach lethal
temperatures in a matter of minutes.</instruction>
