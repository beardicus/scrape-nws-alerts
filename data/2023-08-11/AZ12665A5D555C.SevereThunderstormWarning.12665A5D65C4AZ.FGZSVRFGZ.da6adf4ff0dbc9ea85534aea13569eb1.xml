one of nature`s leading killers. Remember, if you can hear thunder,
you are close enough to be struck by lightning.
If on or near Lake Powell, get away from the water and move indoors
or inside a vehicle. Remember, lightning can strike out to 15 miles
from the parent thunderstorm. If you can hear thunder, you are close
enough to be struck by lightning. Move to safe shelter now! Do not
