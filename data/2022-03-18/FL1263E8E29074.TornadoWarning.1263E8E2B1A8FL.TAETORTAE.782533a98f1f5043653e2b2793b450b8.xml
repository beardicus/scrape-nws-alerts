<instruction>TAKE COVER NOW! Move to a basement or an interior room on the lowest
floor of a sturdy building. Avoid windows. If you are outdoors, in a
mobile home, or in a vehicle, move to the closest substantial shelter
and protect yourself from flying debris.
Heavy rainfall may hide this tornado. Do not wait to see or hear the
tornado. TAKE COVER NOW!
If on or near the beach, get away from the water and move to safe
shelter immediately. If you can hear thunder, you are close enough
to be struck by lightning. Severe thunderstorms can produce large
capsizing waves, even on small bodies of water. Move into dock and
seek safe shelter now! Do not be caught on the water in a
thunderstorm.
Torrential rainfall is occurring with this storm, and may lead to
flash flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flooded roadways.</instruction>
