<description>...MODEST SYSTEM WITH SHOWERS AND INCREASED WINDS THIS WEEKEND...
A fast moving storm system will move across the region Saturday
into early Sunday, bringing breezy winds with chances for rain
and snow showers Saturday into Saturday evening, followed by
chilly conditions with brisk northwest to north winds Sunday.
* SNOW: Projected snowfall amounts are up to 3 inches above 5000
feet across northeastern California including the Tahoe Basin,
and 3-6 inches and locally up to 8 inches for the Sierra above
7000 feet.
* SNOWFALL NOTE: Snowfall projections are for unpaved surfaces.
Roads are likely to remain mainly wet with mountain snow showers
Saturday until mid afternoon, when heavier snowfall rates could
bring periods of slushy or snow-covered passes for a few hours
into Saturday evening. Check with CALTRANS for road conditions
before traveling in the Sierra or northeast California on
Saturday.
* THUNDERSTORMS: Isolated brief thunderstorms are possible between
2 and 8 PM Saturday for west central Nevada, producing a few
lightning strikes, short bursts of heavier rainfall, and very
small hail.
* WINDS: For Saturday, southwest to west winds with peak gusts
25-40 mph for lower elevations, 40-50 mph in wind prone areas
along Highway 395, and 60-80 mph for Sierra ridges. For Sunday,
northwest to north wind gusts 20-30 mph, except gusts around 35
mph for Mineral County and southern Mono County.
Next week will be dry and much warmer with highs well into the
70s for lower elevations and 60s for Sierra valleys by next
Wednesday and Thursday.</description>
