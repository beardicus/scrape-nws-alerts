<headline>Special Weather Statement issued July 29 at 11:12PM CDT  by NWS Little Rock</headline>
<description>...A strong thunderstorm will impact portions of southwestern Marion
and southeastern Boone Counties through 1145 PM CDT...
At 1106 PM CDT, Doppler radar was tracking a strong thunderstorm near
Olvey, or 10 miles east of Harrison, moving east at 5 mph.
HAZARD...Winds in excess of 40 mph. Additionally, localized flash
flooding is possible across the area where 1.5 to 2.5
inches of rain have fallen over the past hour in isolated
spots. Be careful concerning nightime flooding as water
cover roads are a challenge to see at night. However, the
cell has just moved to the east of where the higher
rainfall amounts mentioned above have fallen, but still
remains a concern.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around
unsecured objects.
