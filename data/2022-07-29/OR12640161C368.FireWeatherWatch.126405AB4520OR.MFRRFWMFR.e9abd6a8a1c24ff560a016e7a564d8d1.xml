<description>...Abundant Lightning On Dry Fuels Expected This Weekend...
.Building heat, instability, and increasing moisture along with a
couple of low pressure impulses moving through Saturday and Sunday
into Monday are expected to bring scattered thunderstorms and
abundant lightning on dry fuels this weekend. On Saturday
thunderstorms are expected to develop mid to late afternoon across
western Siskiyou County, across the Siskiyous, and over portions
of the Oregon Cascades. These thunderstorms are then likely to
propagate across portions of Jackson and Josephine counties.
Sunday into Monday an approaching low pressure system will bring
another round of lightning to areas along and near the Cascades and
east of the coastal ranges.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
MONDAY MORNING FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE
WEATHER ZONES 281, 616, 623, 624, AND 625...
The National Weather Service in Medford has issued a Fire Weather
Watch...which is in effect from Sunday afternoon through Monday
morning.
* Impacts:  Lightning and high fire danger will likely result in
new fire starts. Gusty thunderstorm winds could contribute to fire
spread. Despite rainfall, initial attack resources could be
overwhelmed and holdover fires are possible.
* Affected area:
- In Northern CA Fire Zone....281.
- In Southwest OR Fire Zones...616, 623, 624, and 625.
* Wind: Gusty outflow winds of 30 to as high as 50 mph will be
possible with stronger thunderstorm cells Saturday and again
Sunday into Monday.
* Thunderstorms: On Saturday thunderstorms are expected to develop
mid to late afternoon across western Siskiyou County, across the
Siskiyous, and over portions of the Oregon Cascades. These
thunderstorms are then likely to propagate across portions of
Jackson and Josephine counties. Sunday into Monday an
approaching low pressure system will bring another round of
lightning to areas along and near the Cascades and east of the
coastal ranges.
* Rainfall: Sunday into Monday the thunderstorms will be a mix of
wet and dry. Locally significant wetting rainfall will be
possible with some of the thunderstorms, especially the slower
moving ones.

If you have not packed your evacuation kit yet, now is the time to
do so. This includes items like important documents and essentials
you cannot live without. Fill your vehicle`s fuel tank. Visit
ready.gov/kit for more information.
Plan now to avoid using equipment that could cause sparks during
the period when critical weather conditions are possible. Visit
weather.gov/medford/wildfire for links to fire restrictions in
your area.
A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are possible during the valid watch time. These conditions could
promote the rapid spread of wildfires which could become life-
threatening. Check weather.gov/medford for forecast updates and a
possible upgrade of the this watch to a Red Flag Warning.
