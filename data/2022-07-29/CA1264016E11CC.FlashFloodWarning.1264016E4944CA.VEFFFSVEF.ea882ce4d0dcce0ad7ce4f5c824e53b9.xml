<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 845 PM PDT THIS
EVENING FOR CENTRAL INYO COUNTY...
At 703 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms that produced
heavy rain across the warned area. These storms have moved south out
of the warning area but radar estimates of 0.5 and 1.25 inches of
rain have fallen in the Badwater Basin area. Flash flooding is
likely ongoing in this area and could persist for the next hour or
so.
HAZARD...Life-threatening flash flooding.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Life-threatening flash flooding of low-water crossings
over paved and dirt roads, slot canyons, creeks,
normally dry washes and hiking trails.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Furnace Creek, Badwater Basin, and Texas Springs Campground.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
