<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING FOR THE SOLDIER CANYON BURN SCAR REMAINS IN
EFFECT UNTIL 330 PM MDT THIS AFTERNOON FOR NORTHERN OTERO COUNTY...
At 143 PM MDT, emergency management reported thunderstorms producing
heavy rain over the Soldier Canyon Burn Scar. Between 2 and 2.5
inches of rain have fallen. Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2
inches are possible in the warned area. Flash flooding is ongoing or
expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through Soldier Canyon and locations downstream in Mescalero.
The debris flow can consist of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose
materials.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms producing
flash flooding in and around the Soldier Canyon Burn
Scar.
SOURCE...Emergency management reported.
IMPACT...Life threatening flash flooding of areas in and around
the Soldier Canyon Burn Scar.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Mescalero and Soldier Canyon.
FLASH FLOOD...OBSERVED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>This is a life threatening situation. Heavy rainfall will cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks...streams...and
ditches in the Soldier Canyon Burn Scar. Severe debris flows can
also be anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may be washed
away in places. If you encounter flood waters...climb to safety.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.</instruction>
