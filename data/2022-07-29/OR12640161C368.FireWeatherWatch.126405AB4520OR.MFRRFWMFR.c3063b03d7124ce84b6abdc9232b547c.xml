<description>...Abundant Lightning On Dry Fuels Expected This Weekend...
.Building heat, instability, and increasing moisture along with a
couple of low pressure impulses moving through Saturday and Sunday
into Monday are expected to bring scattered thunderstorms and
abundant lightning on dry fuels this weekend. On Saturday
thunderstorms are expected to develop mid to late afternoon across
western Siskiyou County, across the Siskiyous, and over portions
of the Oregon Cascades. These thunderstorms are then likely to
propagate across portions of Jackson and Josephine counties.
Sunday into Monday an approaching low pressure system will bring
another round of lightning to areas along and near the Cascades and
east of the coastal ranges.
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM TO 8 PM PDT SATURDAY FOR
ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONES 280, 617,
620, 621, AND 622...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
MONDAY MORNING FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE
WEATHER ZONES 280, 617, 620, 621, AND 622...
The National Weather Service in Medford has issued a Red Flag
Warning...which is in effect from 2 PM to 8 PM PDT Saturday. A
Fire Weather Watch has also been issued. This Fire Weather Watch
is in effect from Sunday afternoon through Monday morning.
* Impacts: Abundant lightning on critically dry vegetation will
likely result in numerous new fire starts. Gusty thunderstorm
winds could contribute to fire spread. Despite locally heavy
downpour that could be wetting, initial attack resources could
be overwhelmed and holdover fires are possible.
* Affected area:
- In Northern CA Fire Zone....280.
- In Southwest OR Fire Zones...617...620...621...622.
* Wind: Gusty outflow winds of 30 to as high as 50 mph will be
possible with stronger thunderstorm cells Saturday and again
Sunday into Monday.
* Thunderstorms: On Saturday thunderstorms are expected to develop
mid to late afternoon across western Siskiyou County, across the
Siskiyous, and over portions of the Oregon Cascades. These
thunderstorms are then likely to propagate across portions of
Jackson and Josephine counties. Sunday into Monday an
approaching low pressure system will bring another round of
lightning to areas along and near the Cascades and east of the
coastal ranges.
* Rainfall: Thunderstorms on Saturday will begin dry and then
transition to a mix of wet and dry. Sunday into Monday the
thunderstorms will be a mix of wet and dry, as well. Locally
significant wetting rainfall will be possible with some of the
thunderstorms, especially the slower moving ones.

Precautionary/preparedness actions...
Avoid tossing burning cigarettes on the ground, parking hot
vehicles on dry vegetation, and using equipment that can cause
sparks. Follow all fire restrictions. Find links to restrictions
at weather.gov/medford/wildfire. One less spark, one less
wildfire.
Gather your fire evacuation kit now. Collect essentials you don`t
want to lose and prioritize your checklist. Visit ready.gov/kit
for more information.
Familiarize yourself with your evacuation plan. Where will you go?
How will you get there? Who will you call to let others know your
are safe? Visit ready.gov/wildfires for more information.
A Red Flag Warning does not mean there is a fire. It means that
critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now or will
shortly. These conditions promote rapid spread of fire which may
become life threatening. Evacuate if ordered to, or if a fire
threatens.
If you have not packed your evacuation kit yet, now is the time to
do so. This includes items like important documents and essentials
you cannot live without. Fill your vehicle`s fuel tank. Visit
ready.gov/kit for more information.
Plan now to avoid using equipment that could cause sparks during
the period when critical weather conditions are possible. Visit
weather.gov/medford/wildfire for links to fire restrictions in
your area.
A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are possible during the valid watch time. These conditions could
promote the rapid spread of wildfires which could become life-
threatening. Check weather.gov/medford for forecast updates and a
possible upgrade of the this watch to a Red Flag Warning.
