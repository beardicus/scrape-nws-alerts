<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
In hilly or mountainous terrain there are numerous of low water
crossings which are potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not
attempt to cross flooded roads. Find an alternate route.
The heavy rainfall and slow movement of these storms will result in
flooding of road intersections, low lying areas and normally dry
arroyos.</instruction>
