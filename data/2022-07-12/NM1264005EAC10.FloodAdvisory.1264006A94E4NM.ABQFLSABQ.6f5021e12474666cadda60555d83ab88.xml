<instruction>Arroyos, streams, and normally dry rivers can become raging killer
currents in a matter of minutes. Water in arroyos can travel many
miles and take hours to reach your location from upstream rain areas.
Even 6 inches of fast-moving flood water can knock you off your feet
and a depth of 2 feet will float your car. Never try to walk, swim,
or drive through such swift water. If you come upon flood waters,
stop, turn around and go another way.
Remember, ditches are deadly. A gentle flow of water can become a
raging torrent in a few minutes.</instruction>
