<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued July 12 at 1:58PM MDT until July 12 at 4:00PM MDT by NWS Pueblo</headline>
<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM MDT THIS
AFTERNOON FOR SOUTH CENTRAL CHAFFEE COUNTY...
At 158 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing heavy
rain across the warned area. Between 0.5 and 1 inch of rain has
fallen. The expected rainfall rate is 1 to 1.5 inches in 1 hour.
Additional rainfall amounts of 0.5 to 1 inch are possible in the
warned area. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
Storms have shifted to the southern half of the warned area, near
Poncha Pass, where moderate to heavy rainfall will continue.
However, more storms are expected to form north of the warning and
move into it, which could cause further impacts.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,
highways, streets and underpasses as well as other poor
drainage and low-lying areas.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Poncha Springs, Maysville and Poncha Pass.
This includes the following high risk locations...
Highway 285 south of Poncha Springs to Poncha Pass.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
EXPECTED RAINFALL RATE...1-1.5 INCHES IN 1 HOUR</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
