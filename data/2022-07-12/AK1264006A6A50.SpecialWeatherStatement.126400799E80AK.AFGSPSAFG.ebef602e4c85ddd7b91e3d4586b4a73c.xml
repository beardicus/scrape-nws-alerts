<description>...High Water On Rivers Across The Southeast Interior This Week...
Glacial rivers draining the Alaska Range such as the Tanana,
Chisana, and Nabesna Rivers are near bankfull. This is due to high
freezing levels causing significant high elevation snow melt in
the Alaska Range.
Periods of heavy showers over the Southeast Interior Sunday
and Monday night dropped over an inch of rain. Another half inch
of rain is expected on Wednesday. This will cause water to rise
sharply on all rivers in the Southeast Interior this week.
Most of the Alaska Range had one inch of rain on Monday. There
were 3 to 5 inches of rain in the Black Rapids area which caused
a number of washouts of the Richardson Highway. Another half inch
to one inch of rain is expected across the Alaska Range on
Wednesday. This additional rain could cause flooding and landslide
issues Wednesday and Wednesday night in the Denali Park area.
This added rain could add to the flooding and landslide issues
along the Richardson Highway near Isabell Pass area Wednesday
night and Thursday.</description>
