<instruction>Arroyos, streams, and normally dry rivers can become raging killer
currents in a matter of minutes. Water in arroyos can travel many
miles and take hours to reach your location from upstream rain areas.
Remember, ditches are deadly. A gentle flow of water can become a
raging torrent in a few minutes.</instruction>
