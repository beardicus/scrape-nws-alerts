<headline>Coastal Flood Watch issued October 08 at 2:08AM AKDT until October 10 at 10:00PM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH NOW IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY MORNING THROUGH
MONDAY EVENING FOR BRISTOL BAY...
* LOCATION...Bristol Bay coast.
* COASTAL FLOODING...Water level rises from 2 to 5 feet above
normal highest tide line are possible.
* TIMING...Water levels will rise with high tide Monday. They are
expected to peak late Monday afternoon, before subsiding by the
evening as winds shift more northerly.
* IMPACTS...Potential for coastal erosion due to higher seas and
surf with southwesterly to westerly winds. Low lying areas may
also experience flooding.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The associated low has taken a more
southerly track and the strongest core of winds looks to weaken
as its center moves near Cape Newenham Monday morning. As such,
forecasted water levels have subsequently dropped. However,
given the relatively long southwesterly fetch, high surf/coastal
erosion remains possible along the Bristol Bay coast and would
be most likely occur south and east of Cape Constantine.</description>
<instruction>A coastal flood watch means that conditions favorable for
flooding are expected to develop. Coastal residents should be
alert for later statements or warnings, and take action to
protect property.</instruction>
