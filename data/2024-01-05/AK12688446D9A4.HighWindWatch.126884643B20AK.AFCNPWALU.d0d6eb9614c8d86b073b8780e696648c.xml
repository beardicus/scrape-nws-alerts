<headline>High Wind Watch issued January 05 at 4:45AM AKST until January 06 at 9:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY MORNING
THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...West winds 50 to 70 mph with gusts up to 80 mph
possible.
* WHERE...Central Aleutians, including Adak and Atka.
* WHEN...From Saturday morning through Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...High winds could move loose debris, damage property,
and cause power outages. Travel could be difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A rapidly intensifying storm system will
track from the North Pacific into the southern Bering Sea
tonight through Saturday. While the storm is trending faster and
its track has shifted eastward, there continues to be good
potential for high winds across the Central Aleutian Islands.
Precipitation will fall mainly as rain tonight, but could
transition back to a wet snow on Saturday. Thus, there could be
reduced visibilities as the high winds blow the falling snow.</description>
<instruction>A high wind watch means there is potential for a hazardous high
wind event. Monitor the latest forecasts and warnings for updates
on this situation. Fasten loose objects or shelter objects in a
safe location prior to the onset of winds.</instruction>
