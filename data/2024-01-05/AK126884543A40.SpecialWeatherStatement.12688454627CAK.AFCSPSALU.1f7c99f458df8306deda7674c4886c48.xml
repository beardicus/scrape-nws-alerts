<description>...STRONG WINDS THIS WEEKEND ALONG WITH SNOW CHANGING TO RAIN...
A powerful storm system moving into the Bering Sea late Friday
will bring another round of very strong winds to the Pribilof
Islands this weekend. Easterly winds will quickly increase late
Friday night becoming southeasterly through Sunday morning. Expect
sustained winds of 35 to 50 mph with gusts up to 65 mph possible.
There may be a brief lull in the strong winds late Saturday
evening through early Sunday morning before winds shift to the
southwest and increase late Sunday morning through Monday
morning. Expect sustained winds of 35 to 50 mph with gusts to 65
mph during this second round of strong winds. The winds are then
expected to diminish through Monday evening as the low lifts into
the Bering Strait.
A brief period of snow is likely late Friday night. However,
temperatures will quickly warm into the mid to upper 30s as the
winds increase, changing any snow over to rain.</description>
