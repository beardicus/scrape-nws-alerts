<description>...OZONE ALERT EXTENDED THROUGH TOMORROW...
The Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality has issued an ozone
alert through tomorrow, for the Tulsa metropolitan area.
An ozone alert means that conditions are favorable for the
buildup of ozone near the ground, to an unhealthy level.
When winds are light, the vapors from fuels such as gasoline,
exhaust from engines, and air pollutants from industrial activities
remain trapped near the ground. If sunshine is abundant when these
air pollutants build up, a chemical process is triggered that
results in the development of ozone near the ground during the
afternoon and evening hours.
While ozone in the upper levels of the atmosphere is beneficial in
screening the suns radiation, it is harmful near the ground. Ozone
can bother those with respiratory problems and can damage vegetation.
A few simple measures can be taken to help keep the ozone levels from
becoming unhealthy. During ozone alert days:
Postpone any unnecessary driving and car pool if possible.
If you do drive to work,turn The air conditioner in
your car off during your morning commute. You can also cut down on
extra driving by bringing your lunch to work. If you must refuel your
vehicle, do it in the evening after the sun goes down or
postpone your fueling to another day.
Postpone running the lawn mower and gas trimmer, the exhaust from
these small engines contributes a significant amount of pollution
to the air. Industrial facilities should reduce pollution emissions
as much as possible on ozone alert days.
These preventative measures, performed throughout the Tulsa metro
area, can have a tremendous effect in reducing the pollutants that
contribute to ozone problems.
For further information, contact The Oklahoma Department of
Environmental Quality at (918) 293-1600 or the Indian Nations
Council of Governments /incog/ at (918) 584-7526. Additional
information can also be found at www.ozonealert.com...
