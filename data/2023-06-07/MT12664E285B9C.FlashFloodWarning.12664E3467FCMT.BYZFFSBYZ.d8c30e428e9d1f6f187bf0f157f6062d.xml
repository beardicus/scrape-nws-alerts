<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING FOR THE BOBCAT BURN AREA REMAINS IN EFFECT
UNTIL 815 PM MDT THIS EVENING FOR SOUTHEASTERN MUSSELSHELL AND NORTH
CENTRAL YELLOWSTONE COUNTIES...
At 519 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms produced heavy
rain over the BobCat Burn Area one to two hours ago. Between 1 and 2
inches of rain fell.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through the Halfbreed Creek, East Parrot Creek, Parrot Creek,
West Parrot Creek, Musselshell River, Cow Gulch, Railroad Creek,
Fattig Creek, and Rehder Coulee.
Roads impacted include Highway 87, Beard Road, West Parrot Creek
Road, East Parrot Creek Road, Fattig Creek Road, and Rehder Road.
The debris flow can consist of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose
materials.
Heavy rainfall also occurred on the southeast side of the Bull
Mountains one to two hours ago. Flash flooding is ongoing or
expected to begin shortly.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms in and around the
BobCat Burn Area.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flooding of areas in and downstream of the BobCat Burn
Area, as well as on the southeast side of the Bull
Mountains.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Klein.
This does not include the city of Billings.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Life threatening flooding of creeks, roads, and normally dry coulees
in and downstream of the BobCat Burn Area burn area is likely. In
addition to the flash flooding, the heavy rains may trigger
rockslides, mudslides, and debris flows in steep terrain.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles. Do not drive on or attempt to cross
flooded roads, find an alternate route. Roads and driveways may be
damaged or washed out in places.
Remain alert for flooding of creeks, streams, and normally dry
coulees even in areas not receiving rainfall downstream of the burn
area. These can become raging killer currents in a matter of minutes
even from distant rainfall upstream.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency officials and
request they pass the information to the National Weather Service in
Billings.</instruction>
