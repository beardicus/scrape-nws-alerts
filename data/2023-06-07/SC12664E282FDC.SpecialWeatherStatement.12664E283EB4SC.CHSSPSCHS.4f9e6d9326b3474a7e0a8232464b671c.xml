<instruction>Excessive cloud to ground lightning is occurring with this storm.
Lightning can strike 15 miles away from a thunderstorm. Seek safe
shelter inside a building or vehicle.
Beaches are especially dangerous during thunderstorms because
lightning will usually strike the tallest object in the vicinity.
Move off beaches and get in a sturdy structure or automobile
immediately. Many people have been killed by lightning on beaches in
the southeastern United States.
