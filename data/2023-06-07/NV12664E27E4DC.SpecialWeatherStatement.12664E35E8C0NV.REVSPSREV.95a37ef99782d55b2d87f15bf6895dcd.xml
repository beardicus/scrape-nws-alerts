<description>...SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE INTO THE WEEKEND...
* Thunderstorms could be strong to severe this afternoon and
evening, with winds exceeding 50 mph and hail exceeding half an
inch. Localized heavy rainfall, frequent lightning, and isolated
blowing dust are possible, especially over the west-Central
Nevada Basin and Range.
* Thursday through Sunday, the threat transitions into a heavy
rain and flash flood risk, with slow storm motions and increased
moisture present. There is moderate chance for widespread
showers and thunderstorms this weekend.
* If you are outdoors this week, have a storm safety plan. Make sure
to have a way to seek shelter within a sturdy building in case a
thunderstorm forms nearby. If you do not have access to a sturdy
building, a hard-topped vehicle with the windows rolled up is a
good option for protection from lightning. Complete outdoor
activities in the morning before afternoon and evening
thunderstorms develop.
* Cold and fast flows will continue on area streams and rivers.
Avoid recreating near fast-flowing waterways. Afternoon and
evening thunderstorms could generate flash floods, especially near
recent burn scars. If a nearby stream rises quickly or the water
becomes turbid with mud or debris, get to higher ground
immediately.</description>
