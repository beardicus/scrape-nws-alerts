<description>...AIR QUALITY ACTION DAY IN EFFECT FOR THURSDAY, JUNE 8TH...
The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality is forecasting
an Air Quality Action Day for Ouachita and Union Parishes. An Air
Quality Action Day indicates that increasing ozone or fine
particulates (PM 2.5) levels may cause unhealthy air quality
conditions during the afternoon hours. Active children and adults,
the elderly and people with respiratory diseases such as asthma,
should avoid prolonged outdoor exertion. Please take whatever
voluntary steps you can to reduce emissions that contribute to
reduced air quality. Drive less and make sure your automobile is
in good working condition. Make sure your gas cap is tight and
wait until after 6 PM to refuel your vehicle. Additionally, limit
the use of gas powered lawn equipment.
More information about current air quality conditions and what
you can do to help prevent ozone formation or degraded air
quality is available at the Department of Environmental Quality
website: www.airquality.deq.louisiana.gov.</description>
