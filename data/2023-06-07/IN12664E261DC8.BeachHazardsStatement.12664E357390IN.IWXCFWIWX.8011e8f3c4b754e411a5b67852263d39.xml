<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued June 07 at 4:50AM EDT until June 08 at 5:00AM EDT by NWS NorthernIndiana</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH
LATE TONIGHT...
* WHAT...High wave action, strong currents, and dangerous swimming
conditions expected.
* WHERE...In Indiana, Northern La Porte county. In Michigan,
Northern Berrien and Southern Berrien counties.
* WHEN...From this afternoon through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Strong currents can pull swimmers into deeper water.
Also, water temperatures are still in the 50s and thus present
a danger to swimmers. Cold water makes it hard to swim, and can
lead to drowning from stiff muscles and the shock of sudden
immersion.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Wave heights will build to 3 to 5 feet by
late evening with long wave periods that will be conducive to
dangerous currents, especially on the north side of piers.</description>
<instruction>Remain out of the water to avoid hazardous swimming conditions.
Do not venture out on piers.</instruction>
