<headline>Flood Watch issued June 07 at 11:02AM MDT until further notice by NWS Billings</headline>
<description>...The Flood Watch continues for the following rivers in Montana...
Musselshell River near Lavina affecting Golden Valley County.
.The Musselshell River at Shawmut has fallen more than half a foot
since yesterday and upstream decreases at Harlowton indicate the
immediate flood potential has diminished such that the Flood Watch
for the stretch of the Musselshell River near Shawmut can be
cancelled. The Musselshell River downstream at Lavina remains near
flood stage this morning, and runoff from last nights heavy rains in
northern Stillwater county or additional heavy rainfall through
tonight may be enough to push this location over flood stage in the
next 24 hours. Thus the flood watch will continue for the Lavina
stretch of the Musselshell River.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE...
* WHAT...Flooding is possible.
* WHERE...Musselshell River near Lavina.
* WHEN...Until further notice.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of low lying areas along the river is possible.
Significant erosion is likely at flows of this magnitude, and may
result in damage of infrastructure along the river as well as land
loss.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 10:30 AM MDT Wednesday the stage was 9.2 feet.
- The river has remained steady just below flood stage over the
past 24 hours. Upstream drops in the rivers level should
result in decreased flows over the next 24 hours. However
runoff from recent heavy rainfall over northern Stillwater
county may hold flows up, thus the flood watch will continue
until sustained drops in the rivers flow are observed.
- Forecast...Flood stage may be reached based on the latest
forecast information.
- Flood stage is 9.5 feet.
