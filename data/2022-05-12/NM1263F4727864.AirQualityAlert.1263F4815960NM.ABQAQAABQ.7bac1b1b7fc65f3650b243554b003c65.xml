<headline>Air Quality Alert issued May 12 at 2:49PM MDT  by NWS Albuquerque</headline>
<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT...
The following message is transmitted at the request of the New Mexico
Departments of Health and Environment.
* WHAT...Westerly transport winds will diminish through late afternoon
and evening with significantly lighter westerly transport winds
expected on Friday. Smoke transport from winds blowing to the east-
southeast until around sunset will flow down-drainage or down valley
tonight into Friday morning.
* WHERE...Diminishing transport winds with a shift to more down valley
winds will increase the potential for impacts in areas that have not
seen significant smoke in the past 24 to 48 hours. Of particular
concern will be areas between Las Vegas and Sapello extending
eastward to the I-25 corridor near Watrous and Valmora. Smoke
impacts are likely to extend event farther southeast toward the I-40
corridor from near Santa Rosa to the NM/TX line. Although not as
significant, smoke from the Cerro Pelado Fire will have the greatest
impact along the Rio Grande Valley near White Rock and Cochiti
Pueblo extending to Pena Blanca and Kewa Pueblo. Locations likely to
be most impacted include, but are not limited to, the following
communities: Cochiti Pueblo, Kewa Pueblo, La Cueva, Las Vegas, Mora,
Ocate, Pena Blanca, Pojoaque, Santa Clara Pueblo, Sapello, Watrous,
White Rock, and Valmora.
* WHEN...Remainder of this afternoon through noon MDT Friday, May
13th.
* IMPACTS...Those with conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and heart
disease will be especially vulnerable to impacts from poor air
quality, as will adults over age 65, young children, and pregnant
women if smoke concentrations become unhealthy.
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method available
at https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/IndoorQuality.html and
https://cv.nmhealth.org
New Mexicans will also need to take steps to keep their homes cool to
avoid heat-related illnesses. NMDOH offers tips here:
