Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are possible in the
warned area. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin
shortly.

areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as
other poor drainage and low-lying areas. The main area
of concern is Highway 61, where flash flooding may
lead to bridge washouts, especially at the Cascade

dangers of flooding.

enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
