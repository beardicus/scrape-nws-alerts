lying property including parking lots, parks and lawns near the

<instruction>A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in
the advisory area...producing localized beach erosion and
dangerous swimming conditions.
A Coastal Flood Advisory means that onshore winds...wave action
and/or tides will combine to create flooding of low areas along
the shore...and near tidal rivers and creeks. Be prepared for the
possibility of road closures and minor flooding of properties. If
travel is necessary...do not attempt to drive through water of
unknown depth.</instruction>
