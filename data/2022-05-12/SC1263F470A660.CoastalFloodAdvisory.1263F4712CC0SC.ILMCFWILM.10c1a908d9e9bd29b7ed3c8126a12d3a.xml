<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued May 12 at 4:56AM EDT until May 12 at 8:00AM EDT by NWS Wilmington</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM EDT THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Up to one half foot of inundation above ground level in
low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...Coastal Horry County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 8 AM EDT this
morning. For the Beach Hazards Statement, through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Low-lying roads and locations along the Intracoastal
Waterway and adjacent tidal creeks may observe minor coastal
flooding. Check with local officials for any road closures or
impacts. Longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers
into rip currents, piers, jetties, and other hazardous areas.
It may sweep swimmers off their feet, making it difficult to
return to shore.

average tide conditions. Additional locations may experience
flooding during periods of heavy rainfall, high winds, or
other factors.
