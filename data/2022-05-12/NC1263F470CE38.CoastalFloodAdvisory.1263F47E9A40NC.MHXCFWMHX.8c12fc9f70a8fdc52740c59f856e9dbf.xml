<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 8
to 11 feet in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, 1
to 3 feet of inundation above ground level expected near
vulnerable dune structures. For the Beach Hazards Statement,
dangerous rip currents and large breaking waves in the surf
zone.
* WHERE...Northern Outer Banks and Hatteras Island.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT this
evening. For the Beach Hazards Statement, through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Up to 1 to 3 feet of inundation above ground level
is expected for beach-adjacent properties and roadways,
resulting in a significant threat to life and property.
Numerous roads may be closed, including several sections of NC
12 on Hatteras Island. Low lying property including homes,
businesses, and some critical infrastructure will be
inundated. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
shoreline erosion will occur. Rip currents can sweep even the
best swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Dangerous
shore break can throw a swimmer or surfer head first into the
bottom causing neck and back injuries.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Conditions will remain the same, then
gradually improve through the day Thursday. The greatest
threat of ocean overwash and inundation will occur around the
times of high tide. Dune erosion will be progressive and
overwash will likely be worse with each successive high tide.
High tide will be around 500 AM Thursday morning and again
around 530 PM Thursday evening. NC DOT is reporting that NC-12
between Oregon Inlet and Rodanthe will remain closed through
at least Thursday morning.
&amp;&amp;</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Swimmers should remain out of the water due to dangerous surf
conditions.</instruction>
