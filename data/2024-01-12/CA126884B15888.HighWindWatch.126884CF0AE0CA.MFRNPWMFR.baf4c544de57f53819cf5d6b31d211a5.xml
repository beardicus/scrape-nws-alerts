<description>...HIGH WIND WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY MORNING
THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...South winds 25 to 35 mph with gusts up to 60 mph
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of the Shasta Valley. This includes
Interstate 5, US Highway 97, and the communities of Weed and
Grenada.
* WHEN...From Saturday morning through Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...Damaging winds could blow down trees and power
lines. A few power outages are possible. Travel could be
difficult, especially for high profile vehicles.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The winds will largely be tied to the
land falling location of a low pressure system, so guidance is
mixed. Confidence is medium (50%) for winds of at least 55 mph.
