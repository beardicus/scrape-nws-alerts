<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM FRIDAY TO 4 AM
PST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation possible. Total snow
accumulations of a dusting up to 4 inches and ice accumulations
of around 0.4 inches possible. Winds could gust as high as 30 to 50
mph.
* WHERE...North Oregon Coast and Central Oregon Coast.
* WHEN...From 4 PM Friday to 4 AM PST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Power outages and tree damage are likely due to the
ice. Travel could be difficult. The hazardous conditions could
impact the evening commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow will likely begin Friday afternoon but
will likely not accumulate on surfaces until later Friday
evening. Freezing rain may begin Friday night, continuing
through Saturday. It appears precipitation will fall mainly in
the form of freezing rain. Very little to no snow or freezing
rain is expected in the Florence area as temperatures will most
likely stay above freezing that far south. However, uncertainty
remains high regarding exact snow and ice amounts.</description>
