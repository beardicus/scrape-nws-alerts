<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 12 at 6:47PM CST until January 13 at 6:00PM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Dangerous Winter Storm Continues, Winds Increasing...
.A complex winter storm continues to drop heavy snow over
eastern Wisconsin, stretching westward into west-central
Wisconsin. Bands of moderate to light snow were found across
southeast Minnesota and northeast Iowa. Winds are on the increase
with gusts upwards of 45 mph across parts of northeast
Iowa...resulting in blizzard conditions.
Blowing and drifting will become more widespread this evening as
winds continue to ramp up. Highest impacts will be across parts of
northeast Iowa into southwest Wisconsin with blizzard conditions,
and also along and southwest of Highway 52 in southeast Minnesota
where blowing and drifting will drop visibilities to 1/2 mile at
times.
Snow will continue to fall through the evening hours, but will
decrease in intensity and become more focused along and north of
Interstate 90 moving into the overnight.
Travel is hazardous to dangerous for many tonight, especially
where higher snow totals and strongest winds are occurring.
Consider altering, delaying or even canceling travel plans through
the evening.
Bitterly cold air arrives as this storm system exits the area
with wind chills of 20 to 30 below by Saturday night.
