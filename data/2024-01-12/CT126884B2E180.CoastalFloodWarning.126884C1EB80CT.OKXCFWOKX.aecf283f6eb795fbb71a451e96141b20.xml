<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued January 12 at 4:44PM EST until January 13 at 3:00PM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM TO 3 PM EST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...1 ft of inundation above ground level expected in
vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline during high
tide tonight, and 2 to 2 1/2 ft for the Saturday morning high
tide.
* WHERE...Southern Fairfield and Southern New Haven Counties.
* WHEN...From 9 AM to 3 PM EST Saturday.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Widespread moderate flooding of
vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline Saturday
morning, with 2 to 2 1/2 ft of inundation above ground level in
low lying, vulnerable areas. This will result in numerous road
closures and cause widespread flooding of low lying property
including parking lots, parks, lawns and homes/businesses with
basements near the waterfront. Vehicles parked in vulnerable
areas near the waterfront would likely become flooded. Flooding
will also extend inland from the waterfront along tidal rivers
and bays.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...Breaking waves of 2 to 4 ft during the
Saturday morning high tide along coastal CT. This will result in
beach erosion, as well as wave splashover onto shoreline roads
and properties.
* RIVERINE IMPACTS...Freshwater runoff coinciding with the
Saturday morning high tide will exacerbate street and property
flooding issues along tidal reaches of rivers in southwestern
CT and coastal Westchester. Surge up the Hudson River with the
Saturday morning high tide will likely cause minor flooding
for low-lying river-front communities in Westchester,
Rockland, Orange and Putnam counties.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The timing of a wind shift from
southeasterly to southwesterly gales in relation to the time of
high tide Saturday morning will be key to the water level
forecast. Peak surge of 3 to 4 ft will be likely between times
of high tide this evening and Saturday morning, with surge
falling behind the wind shift. An earlier and/or stronger
windshift would keep flood levels below moderate.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
