<description>...SNOW AMOUNTS TRENDING DOWN, BUT DANGEROUSLY COLD AIR REMAINS ON
TRACK FOR THIS WEEKEND INTO NEXT WEEK...
.Snow is moving in a bit slower, and as a result forecast snowfall
amounts have decreased across the region. This will be a long
duration event, with relatively low snowfall rates around 0.5
inches/hour or less. By Saturday night, the best chances for 6 or
more total inches of snow remains east of I-35, south of the Twin
Cities metro, and south of I-94 in western Wisconsin.
Northwest winds will increase Friday afternoon in Saturday,
gusting near 35 mph in portions of southwestern MN. This will
lead to blowing snow and the potential for brief white out
conditions.
Confidence remains high that dangerously cold wind chills will
follow into Saturday night, with widespread values of -25 to
-40 likely through early next week. A Wind Chill Watch has been
issued for much of western and southern Minnesota.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM CST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Steady snow. Additional snow accumulations of 4 to 7
inches.
* WHERE...Rice County.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Patchy blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute.</description>
