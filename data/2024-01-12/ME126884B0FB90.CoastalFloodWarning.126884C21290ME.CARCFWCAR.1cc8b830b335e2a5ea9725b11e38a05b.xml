<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued January 12 at 4:00AM EST until January 13 at 4:00PM EST by NWS Caribou</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM TO 4 PM EST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Moderate coastal flooding likely with areas of major
coastal flooding possible. Two to four feet of inundation above
ground level likely in low lying areas near shorelines.
* WHERE...Coastal Hancock and Coastal Washington Counties.
* WHEN...From 9 AM to 4 PM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Significant to major inundation will affect locations
such as Deer Isle Causeway, Oak Point Causeway on Deer Isle,
Machias, Stonington, Winter Harbor, Bangor, Brewer, Milbridge,
Swans Island, South Lubec and Eastport along with other coastal
locations prone to flooding. Coastal flood waters may compromise
roadways along the Downeast coast potentially cutting off
residences and impacting travel. Large breaking waves will cause
overtopping of exposed coastal roadways, allowing large rocks to
cause damage to vehicles. Areas of concern include but not
limited to, Schoodic Point and Seawall Road. Significant beach erosion
from the previous storm will make erosion prone areas more
susceptible to increased erosion. Extensive beach erosion is
expected at locations such as Roque Bluffs. Major erosion and
damage to dune structures is expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...High tide for Downeast is around 1145 AM.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.</instruction>
