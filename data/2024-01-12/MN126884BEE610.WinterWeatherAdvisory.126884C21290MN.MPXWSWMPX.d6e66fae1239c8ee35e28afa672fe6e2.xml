<description>...SNOW AMOUNTS TRENDING DOWN, BUT DANGEROUSLY COLD AIR REMAINS
ON TRACK FOR THIS WEEKEND INTO NEXT WEEK...
.Snow is moving in a bit slower, and as a result forecast
snowfall amounts have decreased across the region. For this reason
the remaining Winter Storm Warnings have been cancelled. This
will still be a long duration event, with relatively low snowfall
rates around 0.25 inches/hour or less.
Northwest winds will increase Friday afternoon in Saturday,
gusting near 35 mph in portions of southwestern MN. This will
lead to blowing snow and visibilities down to around a half mile.
Confidence remains high that dangerously cold wind chills will
follow into Saturday night, with widespread values of -25 to -40
likely through early next week. A Wind Chill Watch is in effect
for much of western and southern Minnesota.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 PM CST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Snow. Additional snow accumulations of 2 to 4 inches.
Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of south central and southeast Minnesota and
west central Wisconsin.
* WHEN...Until 3 PM CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
The latest road conditions for the state you are calling from can
be obtained by calling 5 1 1. Road conditions can also be found
