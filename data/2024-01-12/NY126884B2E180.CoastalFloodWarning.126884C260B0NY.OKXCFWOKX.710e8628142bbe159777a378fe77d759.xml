<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued January 12 at 4:44PM EST until January 13 at 6:00PM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 AM TO 6 PM EST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT... 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 ft of inundation above ground level
expected in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...Northeast Suffolk County.
* WHEN...From 7 AM to 6 PM EST Saturday.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Widespread moderate flooding of
vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline Saturday
morning, with 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 ft of inundation above ground level
in low lying, vulnerable areas. This will result in numerous
road closures and cause widespread flooding of low lying
property including parking lots, parks, lawns and
homes/businesses with basements near the waterfront. Vehicles
parked in vulnerable areas near the waterfront would likely
become flooded. Flooding will also extend inland from the
waterfront along tidal rivers and bays.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...Breaking waves of 4 to 8 ft are possible
during the Saturday morning high tide. This would result in
beach erosion and minor damage to shoreline structures, as
well as wave splashover onto shoreline roads and properties.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The timing of a wind shift from
southeasterly to southwesterly gales in relation to the time
of high tide Saturday morning will be key to the water level
forecast.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
