<description>...Dangerous Winter Storm through Early Saturday...
.The winds across parts of northeast Iowa and Grant County in
southwest Wisconsin are expected to strengthen from mid to late
afternoon and then continue through midnight. Sustained winds will
range from 30 to 35 mph and wind gust will be as high as 45 mph.
Blowing snow will significantly reduce visibility to near white
out or blizzard conditions at times, especially in rural or open
areas.
Heavy snow will continue to fall south of a Charles City
Iowa to Wisconsin Rapids line. Snow rates will be as high as 1
inch per hour at times, especially across northeast Iowa through
southwest and central Wisconsin. Winds will increase later this

Travel will become hazardous for most of the region, potentially

altering, delaying or even canceling travel plans if conditions
warrant it.

with wind chills of 20 to 30 below by Saturday night.
