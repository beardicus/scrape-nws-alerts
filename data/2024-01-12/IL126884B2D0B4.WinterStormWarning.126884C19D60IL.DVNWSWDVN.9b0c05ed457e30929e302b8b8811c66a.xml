<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST
SATURDAY...
...WIND CHILL WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY EVENING
THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Snow with additional accumulations 1 to 4 inches.
Northwest winds gusting up to 45 mph. For the Wind Chill Watch,
dangerously cold wind chills possible. Wind chills as low as 35
below zero.
* WHERE...Portions of north central Illinois.
* WHEN...For the Winter Storm Warning, until noon CST Saturday.
For the Wind Chill Watch, from Saturday evening through
Tuesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be difficult at times due to slick and
snow covered roads. Blowing and drifting snow tonight and
Saturday morning will likely result in near blizzard
conditions. Gusty winds could bring down tree branches, which
could lead to isolated power outages. For later this weekend
into early next week, dangerously cold wind chills could cause
frostbite on exposed skin in as little as ten minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Rain and possibly brief freezing rain
will mix with snow at times today, and may even become all
rain for a period before cold air and strong winds move in
changing the precipitation back to all snow. Tonight, much
colder air moves in which could result in a flash freeze on
roadways.</description>

your vehicle in case of an emergency.
