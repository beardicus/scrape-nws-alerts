<headline>Snow Squall Warning issued January 12 at 3:48PM MST until January 12 at 4:45PM MST by NWS Cheyenne</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Cheyenne has issued a
* Snow Squall Warning for...
Northeastern Carbon County in south central Wyoming...
Central Albany County in southeastern Wyoming...
* Until 445 PM MST.
* At 345 PM MST, multiple dangerous snow squalls were impacting
areas near Arlington and Elk Mountain, as well as near Medicine
Bow and Rock River. Movement of these squalls was generally east
at 45 MPH.
HAZARD...Whiteout conditions with near zero visibility associated
with intense bursts of heavy snow and gusty winds leading
to blowing snow. Wind gusts greater than 50 mph could
knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured objects.
SOURCE...Radar and webcams.
IMPACT...Dangerous and life-threatening travel conditions are
expected to develop rapidly in the warning area.
This includes Interstate 80 in Wyoming between mile markers 239 and
289.
Locations impacted include...
Hanna, Medicine Bow, Rock River, Elk Mountain, Battle Mountain,
Bosler, Garrett, Friend Park Campground, Wheatland Reservoir 3, and
Arlington.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Reduce speed and turn on headlights! During snow squalls, the
visibility may suddenly drop to near zero in whiteout conditions.
There is no safe place on a highway when a snow squall hits.
Visibility and traction are immediately lost in whiteout conditions,
making it difficult or impossible to slow down and avoid stopped
vehicles. Delay travel or safely exit the highway before the snow
squall arrives.
