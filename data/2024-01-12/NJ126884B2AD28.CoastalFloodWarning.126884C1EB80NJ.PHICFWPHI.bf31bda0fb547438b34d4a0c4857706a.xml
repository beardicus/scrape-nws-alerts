<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 8 PM THIS EVENING TO 3 PM
EST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...One to two feet of inundation above ground level
expected in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways.
* WHERE...In Delaware, New Castle. In New Jersey, Salem.
* WHEN...From 8 PM this evening to 3 PM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...At this level, widespread roadway flooding occurs
along tidal waterways. Some roads become impassable. Minor
damage to vulnerable structures may begin to occur.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Strong southerly winds are forecast to
increase tonight, which is forecast to lead to another round of
moderate to major coastal flooding impacts along the tidal
Delaware River beginning with the overnight high tide tonight.
Due to additional fresh water runoff and persistent southwest
winds, moderate to major flooding is forecast to persist
through the Saturday afternoon high tide as well.
