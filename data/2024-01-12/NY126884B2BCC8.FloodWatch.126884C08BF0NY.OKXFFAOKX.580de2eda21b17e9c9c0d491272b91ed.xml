<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 10 PM EST THIS EVENING THROUGH
SATURDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of southern Connecticut, including the following
areas, Northern Fairfield, Northern Middlesex, Northern New Haven,
Northern New London, Southern Fairfield, Southern Middlesex,
Southern New Haven and Southern New London, northeast New Jersey,
including the following areas, Eastern Bergen, Eastern Essex,
Eastern Passaic, Eastern Union, Hudson, Western Bergen, Western
Essex, Western Passaic and Western Union, and southeast New York,
including the following areas, Northern Westchester, Rockland and
Southern Westchester.
* WHEN...From 10 PM EST this evening through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Area creeks and
streams are running high and could flood with more heavy rain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Another deepening low will track up through the Great Lakes
tonight, sending a strong frontal system through the area.
Moderate to occasionally heavy rainfall will fall across the
area with a widespread 1.5 to to 2.5 inches of rainfall, with
locally higher amounts possible. Due to the recent heavy
rainfall event, streamflow is high and grounds are saturated.
Quick responding rivers and streams will likely reach or
exceed bankfull. In addition, coastal flooding will likely
exacerbate flooding on tidal rivers.
