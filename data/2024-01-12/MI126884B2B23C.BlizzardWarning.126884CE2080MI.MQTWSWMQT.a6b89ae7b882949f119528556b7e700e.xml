<headline>Blizzard Warning issued January 12 at 3:23PM EST until January 13 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Marquette</headline>
<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions. Additional snow accumulations of 14
to 31 inches, greatest in the high terrain from near Herman to
Ishpeming and Negaunee. The lowest totals will be along the
Lake Superior shoreline and well inland near Watton, Witch Lake,
and Arnold. Winds gusting as high as 35 to 45 mph tonight into
Saturday morning, highest along the Lake Superior shoreline.
* WHERE...Marquette County.
* WHEN...Until 7 PM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible,
particularly closer to the Superior shoreline. Widespread
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. The
hazardous conditions could impact the evening commute. Gusty
winds could bring down tree branches and result in power outages.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Blizzard conditions continue tonight
through Saturday morning, then winds slowly fall back through
the day Saturday. As system snowfall comes to an end Saturday,
expect lake enhanced snowfall to continue the rest of Saturday
into Saturday night.</description>
<instruction>Travel should be restricted to emergencies only. If you must
travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded,
stay with your vehicle.</instruction>
