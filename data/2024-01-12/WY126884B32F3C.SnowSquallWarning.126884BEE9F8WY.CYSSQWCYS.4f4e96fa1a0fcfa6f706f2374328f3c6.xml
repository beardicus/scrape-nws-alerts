<headline>Snow Squall Warning issued January 12 at 4:43PM MST until January 12 at 5:30PM MST by NWS Cheyenne</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Cheyenne has issued a
* Snow Squall Warning for...
East central Carbon County in south central Wyoming...
Central Albany County in southeastern Wyoming...
* Until 530 PM MST.
* At 442 PM MST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from 14 miles west of Elk Mountain to near Arlington to 8
miles northwest of Laramie, moving east at 30 mph.
HAZARD...Whiteout conditions with near zero visibility associated
with intense bursts of heavy snow and gusty winds leading
to blowing snow. Wind gusts greater than 50 mph could
knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured objects.
SOURCE...Radar and webcams.
IMPACT...Dangerous and life-threatening travel conditions are
expected to develop rapidly in the warning area.
This includes Interstate 80 in Wyoming between mile markers 236 and
299.
Locations impacted include...
Rock River, Elk Mountain, Bow River Campground, Bosler, Deep Creek
Campground, and Arlington.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Reduce speed and turn on headlights! During snow squalls, the
visibility may suddenly drop to near zero in whiteout conditions.
There is no safe place on a highway when a snow squall hits.
Visibility and traction are immediately lost in whiteout conditions,
making it difficult or impossible to slow down and avoid stopped
vehicles. Delay travel or safely exit the highway before the snow
squall arrives.
