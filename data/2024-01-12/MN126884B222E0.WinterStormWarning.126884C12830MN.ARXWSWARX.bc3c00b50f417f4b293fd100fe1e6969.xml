<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 12 at 10:56AM CST until January 13 at 9:00AM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Dangerous Winter Storm through Early Saturday...
.The winds across parts of northeast Iowa and Grant County in
southwest Wisconsin are expected to strengthen from mid to late
afternoon and then continue through midnight. Sustained winds will
range from 30 to 35 mph and wind gust will be as high as 45 mph.
Blowing snow will significantly reduce visibility to near white
out or blizzard conditions at times, especially in rural or open
areas.
Heavy snow will continue to fall south of a Charles City
Iowa to Wisconsin Rapids line. Snow rates will be as high as 1
inch per hour at times, especially across northeast Iowa through
southwest and central Wisconsin. Winds will increase later this
afternoon leading to blowing and drifting in open areas.
Travel will become hazardous for most of the region, potentially
impossible where snowfall and winds are the highest. Consider
altering, delaying or even canceling travel plans if conditions
warrant it.
Bitterly cold air arrives as this storm system exits the area
with wind chills of 20 to 30 below by Saturday night.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM CST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow. Additional snow accumulations of 4 to 9
inches. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of northeast Iowa and southeast Minnesota.
* WHEN...Until 9 AM CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Patchy blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the evening commute.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
