<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM SATURDAY TO
3 PM EST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy lake effect snow and very strong winds expected.
Total snow accumulations of 5 to 10 inches in the most
persistent lake snows. Winds gusting as high as 65 mph early in
the event will diminish somewhat later Saturday night. The
strongest winds will be Saturday into Sunday. Blizzard
conditions will be possible at times, especially late Saturday
night through Sunday morning.
* WHERE...Niagara and Orleans counties, especially southern
portions of the counties.
* WHEN...From 10 AM Saturday to 3 PM EST Sunday. The band of heavy
lake effect snow is expected to oscillate north and south
several times through the course of the event, resulting in
varying conditions over time.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be very difficult with snow covered
roads. Widespread blowing snow will significantly reduce
visibility. Strong winds could cause tree and powerline damage.</description>
<instruction>Heavy snow will fall in relatively narrow bands. If traveling, be
prepared for rapidly changing road conditions and visibilities.
Submit snow reports through our website or social media.</instruction>
