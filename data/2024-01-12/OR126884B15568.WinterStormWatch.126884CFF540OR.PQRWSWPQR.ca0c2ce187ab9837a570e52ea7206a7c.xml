<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 12 at 3:30AM PST until January 14 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM PST SUNDAY
ABOVE 1500 FEET...
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM FRIDAY UNTIL 4
AM PST SUNDAY BELOW 1500 FEET...
* WHAT...For the Winter Storm Warning above 1500 feet, heavy snow
expected. Additional snow accumulations of up to 1 foot, highest
above 2000 feet. Winds could gust as high as 50 mph. For the
Winter Storm Watch, snow and freezing rain possible. Total snow
accumulations of up to 6 inches and ice accumulations of around
0.4 inches possible. Winds could gust as high as 55 mph.
* WHERE...Northern Oregon Cascade Foothills and Cascade
Foothills in Lane County.
* WHEN...For the Winter Storm Warning, until 4 AM PST Sunday.
For the Winter Storm Watch, from this afternoon through late
Saturday night.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult above 1500 feet. Gusty
winds could cause white-out conditions at times near the
Columbia River Gorge. Ice accumulation and gusty winds could
bring down tree branches, leading to power outages. Bitter cold
wind chills as low as 25 below zero could cause frostbite on
exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...For elevations below 1500 feet, snow will
likely begin Friday evening but will likely not accumulate on
surfaces until later Friday night. Mainly freezing rain is
expected for the Cascade foothills in Marion County and south
while mainly snow is expected for the Cascade foothills north of
Marion County. However, uncertainty remains high regarding
exact snow and ice amounts, as well as exact temperatures in the
Lane County Cascade foothills where there is a chance
temperatures stay above freezing with minimal impacts.</description>
