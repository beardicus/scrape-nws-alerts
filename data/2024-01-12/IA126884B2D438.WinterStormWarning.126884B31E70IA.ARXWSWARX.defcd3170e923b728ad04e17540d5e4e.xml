<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 12 at 3:10PM CST until January 12 at 5:00PM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Dangerous Winter Storm Peaking Now and into the Evening...
.A complex winter storm continues to bring heavy snow to central
and southwest Wisconsin into far northeast Iowa. Winds were also
on the increase with blowing and drifting now becoming more of a
problem across parts of Iowa...mainly southwest of Highway 52.
Further northwest snow was not as heavy and snow amount forecasts
have been lowered northwest of a line from Austin to Winona
Minnesota to Medford Wisconsin. The Winter Storm Warning was
replaced by an Advisory for much of that area.
The winter storm will continue to bring snow, heaviest east and
south of the La Crosse - Winona area through the evening before
becoming lighter. Whiteout conditions will become more widespread
near and southwest of Highway 52 in northeast Iowa and extreme
southwest Wisconsin. Travel will become more dangerous after
sunset with darkness and whiteout in blowing snow there as winds
gust to 45 mph. Consider altering, delaying or even canceling
travel plans through the evening.
Bitterly cold air arrives as this storm system exits the area
with wind chills of 20 to 30 below by Saturday night.
