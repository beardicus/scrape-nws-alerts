<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued January 12 at 4:44PM EST until January 13 at 2:00PM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 AM TO 2 PM EST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...2 to 2 1/2, locally 3 ft of inundation above ground
level expected in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and
shoreline.
* WHERE...Southern Queens County.
* WHEN...From 7 AM to 2 PM EST Saturday.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Widespread moderate to locally major
flooding of vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline
Saturday morning, with 2 to 2 1/2 ft, locally 3 ft of
inundation above ground level in low lying, vulnerable areas.
This will result in numerous road closures and cause
widespread flooding of low lying property including parking
lots, parks, lawns and homes/businesses with basements near
the waterfront. Vehicles parked in vulnerable areas near the
waterfront will likely become flooded and destroyed. Flooding
will also extend inland from the waterfront along tidal rivers
and bays.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...Breaking waves of 8 to 12 ft along the
oceanfront may result in scattered dune erosion and localized
overwashes. Localized flooding of roadways and vulnerable
structures behind protective dunes is possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The timing of a wind shift from
southeasterly to southwesterly gales in relation to the time of
high tide Saturday morning will be key to the water level
forecast. Peak surge of 3 to 4 ft will be likely between times
of high tide this evening and Saturday morning. Tidal piling
may inhibit the recession of water before the Saturday AM high
tide, which would cause major flooding (around 3 ft of
inundation above ground). Residents in coastal communities in
this area should prepare for the potential of major coastal
flooding (3ft of inundation above ground).
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
