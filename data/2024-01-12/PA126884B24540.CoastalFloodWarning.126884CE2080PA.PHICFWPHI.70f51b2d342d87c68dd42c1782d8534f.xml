<senderName>NWS Philadelphia - Mount Holly (New Jersey, Delaware, Southeastern Pennsylvania)</senderName>
<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued January 12 at 12:44PM EST until January 13 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Philadelphia - Mount Holly</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Two to three feet of inundation above ground level in
low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...In New Jersey, Mercer, Gloucester, Camden and
Northwestern Burlington. In Pennsylvania, Delaware,
Philadelphia and Lower Bucks.
* WHEN...Until 7 PM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...At this level, flooding may become severe enough to
cause some structural damage along with widespread roadway
flooding near tidal waterways. Some locations may become
isolated by the flood waters. At this level, widespread
roadway flooding occurs along tidal waterways. Some roads
become impassable. Minor damage to vulnerable structures may
begin to occur.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Widespread minor flooding is now forecast
to occur with this afternoon`s high tide, so this Warning will
now go into effect starting this afternoon. Strong southerly
winds are forecast to increase tonight, which is forecast to
lead to another round of moderate to major coastal flooding
impacts along the tidal Delaware River beginning with the
overnight high tide tonight. Due to additional fresh water
runoff and persistent southwest winds, moderate to major
flooding is forecast to persist through the Saturday afternoon
high tide as well.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
