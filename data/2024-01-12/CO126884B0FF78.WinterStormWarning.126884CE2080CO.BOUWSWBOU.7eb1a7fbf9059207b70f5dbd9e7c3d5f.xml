<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 12 at 2:10AM MST until January 13 at 5:00PM MST by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>...ARCTIC BLAST AND HEAVY MOUNTAIN SNOW...
.Snow will increase in the mountains this afternoon and evening. The
snow will combine with strong winds gusts of 50 to 75 mph above
timberline to produce widespread blowing and drifting snow, poor
visibility, and dangerous travel conditions.
While the snow may taper off Saturday, another round of even heavier
snow is expected develop Saturday night and continue through Sunday.
On the plains, arctic cold will settle across the area tonight, with
dangerously cold wind chill readings expected to last all the way
through Tuesday morning. This will be an extended cold snap,
resulting in a heightened risk of frostbite and hypothermia for
people with prolonged outdoor exposure, and an increased burden on
outdoor animals.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM MST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow and blowing snow. Total snow accumulations
between 6 and 12 inches, with up to 18 inches in the Park Range.
Winds gusting in the 50 to 75 mph range over the higher elevations
and east slopes.
* WHERE...Rabbit Ears Pass, Rocky Mountain National Park and the
Medicine Bow Range, and The Mountains of Summit County, the
Mosquito Range, and the Indian Peaks.
* WHEN...Until 5 PM MST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel will become difficult to impossible at times due
to heavy snowfall and strong winds. Blowing snow could
significantly reduce visibility. Travel restrictions are likely,
and road closures are possible over the mountain passes.</description>
<instruction>Consider delaying travel over the mountains, or traveling early
today before the worst conditions. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution.
Consider taking a winter storm kit along with you, including such
items as tire chains, booster cables, flashlight, shovel, blankets
and extra clothing. Also take water, a first aid kit, and anything
else that would help you survive in case you become stranded.
