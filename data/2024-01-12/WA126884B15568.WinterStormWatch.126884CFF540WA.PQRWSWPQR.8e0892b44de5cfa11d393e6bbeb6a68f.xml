<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 12 at 3:30AM PST until January 14 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM SATURDAY TO 4 AM
PST SUNDAY ABOVE 1500 FEET...
...WINTER STORM WATCH NOW IN EFFECT FROM FROM 4 AM SATURDAY TO 4
AM PST SUNDAY FOR ELEVATIONS BELOW 1500 FEET...
* WHAT...For the Winter Weather Advisory above 1500 feet, snow
expected. Total snow accumulations of 2 to 8 inches. Winds
gusting as high as 60 to 85 mph near the mouth of the Columbia
River Gorge. For the Winter Storm Watch, heavy snow possible.
Total snow accumulations of 2 to 4 inches possible. Winds could
gust as high as 60 to 80 mph near the mouth of the Columbia
River Gorge.
* WHERE...South Washington Cascade Foothills.
* WHEN...For the Winter Weather Advisory, from 4 AM Saturday to 4
AM PST Sunday. For the Winter Storm Watch, from 4 AM Saturday to
4 AM PST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Patchy blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility. Very strong winds could
cause extensive tree damage and power outages. The cold wind
chills as low as 30 below zero could cause frostbite on exposed
skin in as little as 30 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...For elevations above 1500 feet, light snow
will be possible at times on Friday, but accumulation will be
less than 1-2 inches. For elevations below 1500 feet, the
timing of accumulating snow onset has pushed back to early
Saturday morning as the weather system track has shifted south.
There may be snow flurries in occasional showers on Friday with
no accumulating snow. Snow amounts will depend on how quickly
accumulating snow begins on Saturday and diminishes early Sunday
morning, which remains uncertain.</description>
