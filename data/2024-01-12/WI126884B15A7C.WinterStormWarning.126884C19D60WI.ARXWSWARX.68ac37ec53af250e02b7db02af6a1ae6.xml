impossible where snowfall and winds are the highest. Consider
altering, delaying or even canceling travel plans if conditions
warrant it.
Bitterly cold air arrives as this storm system exits the area
with wind chills of 20 to 30 below by Saturday night.

* IMPACTS...Travel will be very difficult. Blowing snow could

possible. Sporadic power outages could occur. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning and evening commutes.</description>
