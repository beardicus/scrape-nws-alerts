<description>...SNOW AMOUNTS TRENDING DOWN, BUT DANGEROUSLY COLD AIR REMAINS ON
TRACK FOR THIS WEEKEND INTO NEXT WEEK...
.Snow is moving in a bit slower, and as a result forecast snowfall
amounts have decreased across the region. This will be a long
duration event, with relatively low snowfall rates around 0.5
inches/hour or less. By Saturday night, the best chances for 6 or
more total inches of snow remains east of I-35, south of the Twin
Cities metro, and south of I-94 in western Wisconsin.
Northwest winds will increase Friday afternoon in Saturday,
gusting near 35 mph in portions of southwestern MN. This will
lead to blowing snow and the potential for brief white out
conditions.
Confidence remains high that dangerously cold wind chills will
follow into Saturday night, with widespread values of -25 to
-40 likely through early next week. A Wind Chill Watch has been
issued for much of western and southern Minnesota.
...WINTER STORM WARNING NOW IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM THIS MORNING TO
6 AM CST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Steady snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 4 to 7
inches. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of east central and southeast Minnesota and
west central Wisconsin.
* WHEN...From 9 AM this morning to 6 AM CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Patchy blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the evening commute.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
The latest road conditions for the state you are calling from can
be obtained by calling 5 1 1. Road conditions can also be found
