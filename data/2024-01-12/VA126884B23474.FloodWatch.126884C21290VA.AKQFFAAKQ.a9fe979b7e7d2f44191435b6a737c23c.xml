<headline>Flood Watch issued January 12 at 12:01PM EST until January 13 at 4:00PM EST by NWS Wakefield</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM EST THIS EVENING THROUGH
LATE TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by moderate to locally heavy rainfall over
saturated ground and several rivers already in flood.
* WHERE...Portions of central, east central, north central, and
south central Virginia, including the following areas, in central
Virginia, Amelia, Cumberland, Eastern Chesterfield (Including Col.
Heights), Eastern Hanover, Eastern Henrico, Eastern Louisa,
Fluvanna, Goochland, Powhatan, Prince Edward, Western
Chesterfield, Western Hanover, Western Henrico (Including the City
of Richmond) and Western Louisa. In east central Virginia, Western
King William. In north central Virginia, Caroline. In south
central Virginia, Brunswick, Dinwiddie, Lunenburg, Mecklenburg,
Nottoway and Prince George.
* WHEN...From 6 PM EST this evening through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in additional flooding of
rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone
locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A cold front pushes through the area tonight with rounds of
showers possible from late this afternoon into tonight. Area
average rainfall is expected to range from a half of an inch
to three quarters of an inch with locally higher totals
around one inch possible. Recent heavy rain has allowed for
soils to remain very saturated and not able to hold much
additional rainfall. Additionally, rivers and creeks remain
high across the area with many rivers still in flood stage.
As such, any additional rainfall may cause flooding.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
