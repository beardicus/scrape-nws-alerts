<headline>High Surf Advisory issued January 12 at 3:22PM HST until January 13 at 6:00PM HST by NWS Honolulu</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY FOR THE NORTH FACING SHORES OF NIIHAU KAUAI
OAHU MOLOKAI MAUI AND THE BIG ISLAND THROUGH SATURDAY AFTERNOON...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY FOR WEST FACING SHORES OF NIIHAU KAUAI OAHU
AND MOLOKAI THROUGH EARLY SATURDAY MORNING...
...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT IN EFFECT THROUGH EARLY SATURDAY
MORNING FOR ALL HAWAIIAN ISLANDS...
.A northwest (320 degree) and north (350 degree) swell will
pass through the region through Saturday, with both swells
peaking at high end advisory levels for exposed north and west
facing shores. As the north component becomes more dominate
Saturday, surf along west facing shores will fall below advisory
levels, while surf along north facing shores lingers above
advisory levels. Additional wave run-up is possible during the
early morning high tides Saturday and Sunday due to higher than
predicted tides. This will likely produce minor to localized
moderate coastal flooding Saturday morning.
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY FOR NORTH FACING SHORES NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL
6 PM HST SATURDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY FOR WEST FACING SHORES IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM
HST SATURDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH 6 AM HST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, surf peaking at 18 to 22 feet
along north facing shores, and then lowering through the day
Saturday. For west facing shores, 10 to 14 feet along west
facing shores, and then lowering below 12 feet by 6 am Saturday.
For the Coastal Flood Statement, minor to localized moderate
low lying coastal flooding during times of high tide.
* WHERE...For the High Surf Advisory, north and west facing
shores of Niihau, Kauai, Oahu and Molokai, and for the north
facing shores of Maui. For the Coastal Flood Statement, any low
lying flood prone coastal location.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory for north facing shores, until
6 PM HST Saturday. For the High Surf Advisory for west facing
shores, and the Coastal Flood Statement until 6 AM HST
Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of beaches that are normally dry, minor
coastal erosion, and saltwater inundation. Moderate. Strong
breaking waves and strong currents will make swimming
dangerous.

<instruction>Avoid driving through flooded roadways. If you are forced to
drive through salt water, be sure to rinse your vehicle with
fresh water. Move electronics, vehicles or other valuables to
higher ground. Monitor vessels to ensure mooring lines don`t get
too tight and watch out for overwash around boat ramps. Secure
canoes or other watercraft stowed on beaches.
Head all advice from ocean safety officials. When in doubt, don`t
go out.</instruction>
