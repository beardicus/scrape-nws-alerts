<description>...SNOW AMOUNTS TRENDING DOWN, BUT DANGEROUSLY COLD AIR REMAINS
ON TRACK FOR THIS WEEKEND INTO NEXT WEEK...
.Snow is moving in a bit slower, and as a result forecast
snowfall amounts have decreased across the region. This will be a
long duration event, with relatively low snowfall rates around
0.5 inches/hour or less. By Saturday night, the best chances for
6 or more total inches of snow remains east of I-35, south of the
Twin Cities metro, and south of I-94 in western Wisconsin.
Northwest winds will increase Friday afternoon in Saturday,
gusting near 35 mph in portions of southwestern MN. This will
lead to blowing snow and the potential for brief white out
conditions.
Confidence remains high that dangerously cold wind chills will
follow into Saturday night, with widespread values of -25 to -40
likely through early next week. A Wind Chill Watch is in effect for
much of western and southern Minnesota.
