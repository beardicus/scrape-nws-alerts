<headline>High Surf Advisory issued January 12 at 3:22PM HST until January 13 at 6:00AM HST by NWS Honolulu</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY FOR THE NORTH FACING SHORES OF NIIHAU KAUAI
OAHU MOLOKAI MAUI AND THE BIG ISLAND THROUGH SATURDAY AFTERNOON...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY FOR WEST FACING SHORES OF NIIHAU KAUAI OAHU
AND MOLOKAI THROUGH EARLY SATURDAY MORNING...
...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT IN EFFECT THROUGH EARLY SATURDAY
MORNING FOR ALL HAWAIIAN ISLANDS...
.A northwest (320 degree) and north (350 degree) swell will
pass through the region through Saturday, with both swells
peaking at high end advisory levels for exposed north and west
facing shores. As the north component becomes more dominate
Saturday, surf along west facing shores will fall below advisory
levels, while surf along north facing shores lingers above
advisory levels. Additional wave run-up is possible during the
early morning high tides Saturday and Sunday due to higher than
predicted tides. This will likely produce minor to localized
moderate coastal flooding Saturday morning.
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY FOR WEST FACING SHORES REMAINS IN EFFECT
UNTIL 6 AM HST SATURDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH 6 AM HST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, surf peaking at 10 to 15
feet along west facing shores. For the Coastal Flood Statement,
minor to localized moderate low lying coastal flooding during
times of high tide.
* WHERE...For the High Surf Advisory, west facing shores of Kauai,
Oahu and Molokai. For the Coastal Flood Statement, any low
lying flood prone coastal location.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM HST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of beaches that are normally dry, minor
coastal erosion, and saltwater inundation. Moderate. Strong
breaking waves and strong currents will make swimming
dangerous.
Submit your coastal flooding photos to the University of Hawaii
Sea Grant College Program`s Hawaii and Pacific Islands King
Tides Project at:

<instruction>Avoid driving through flooded roadways. If you are forced to
drive through salt water, be sure to rinse your vehicle with
fresh water. Move electronics, vehicles or other valuables to
higher ground. Monitor vessels to ensure mooring lines don`t get
too tight and watch out for overwash around boat ramps. Secure
canoes or other watercraft stowed on beaches.
Head all advice from ocean safety officials. When in doubt, don`t
go out.</instruction>
