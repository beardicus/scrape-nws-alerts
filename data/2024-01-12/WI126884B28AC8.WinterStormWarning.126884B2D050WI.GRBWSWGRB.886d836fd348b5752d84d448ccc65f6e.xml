<description>...A SIGNIFICANT WINTER STORM TO IMPACT THE REGION WITH HEAVY SNOW
AND STRONG WINDS THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING...
.A strengthening low pressure system will track from the
mid-Mississippi Valley to the central Great Lakes today into
Saturday. The strong system will bring heavy snow and strong winds
to the region. Most of the region should see between 7 to 15 inches
of snow, with the highest amounts across northeast Wisconsin. In
addition, wind gusts could reach around 50 mph in the Fox Valley and
lakeshore areas where blizzard conditions are expected late this
afternoon into Saturday morning. Temperatures near freezing could
locally reduce snowfall totals right along the Lake Michigan
shoreline today.

AFTERNOON...
...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Winter Storm Warning, heavy snow. Additional snow
