<headline>High Wind Warning issued January 12 at 9:50AM EST until January 13 at 11:00AM EST by NWS Burlington</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 11 PM THIS EVENING TO 11 AM
EST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Southeast winds 25 to 35 mph with gusts up to 65 mph
expected.
* WHERE...Western Chittenden County, especially along and east of
the Route 2A corridor.
* WHEN...From 11 PM this evening to 11 AM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Damaging winds could blow down trees and power lines.
Scattered to widespread power outages are expected. Travel will
be difficult, especially for high profile vehicles.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Period of strongest winds is expected to be
between midnight and 9 AM on Saturday. In addition, given that
given that soils are saturated and property and vegetation were
impacted by a high wind event just 72 hours prior, the
threshold for damages may be lower with this event.</description>
<instruction>People should avoid being outside in forested areas and around
trees and branches. If possible, remain in the lower levels of
your home during the windstorm, and avoid windows. Use caution if
you must drive.</instruction>
