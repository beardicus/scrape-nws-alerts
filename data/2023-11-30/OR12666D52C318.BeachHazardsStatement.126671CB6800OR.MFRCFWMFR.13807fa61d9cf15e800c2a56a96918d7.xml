<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE FRIDAY
NIGHT THROUGH LATE MONDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...An extended period of sustained wave action is expected
as a series of fronts moves through the region along with
multiple moderate swell trains. Breaking waves of 15 to 20 ft
will coincide with higher than normal ocean levels, leading to
an increased risk of beach erosion. Additionally, there is a
minor risk of sneaker waves as these swell trains build into
the waters.
* WHERE...The beaches of Douglas, Coos and Curry Counties.
* WHEN...From late Friday night through late Monday night.
* IMPACTS...Beaches will be hazardous places to be at times this
weekend and into next week, and jetties and rocks are not safe
places to be. Beach erosion is possible. Sneaker waves can run
up significantly farther on beaches than normal, including
over rocks and jetties. These waves can suddenly knock people
off of their feet and quickly pull them into the cold ocean
waters, resulting in serious injury or death. Waves may also
lift driftwood logs, trapping anyone caught underneath.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Confidence is low regarding the sneaker
threat due to wind wave interference likely limiting, but not
completely negating the risk.

<instruction>Avoid climbing on rocks and jetties. Stay away from the ocean and
remain out of the water to avoid hazardous conditions.</instruction>
