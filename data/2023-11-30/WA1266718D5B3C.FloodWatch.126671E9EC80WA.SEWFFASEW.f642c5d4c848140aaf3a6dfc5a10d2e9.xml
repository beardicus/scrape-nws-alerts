<description>.An active weather pattern will continue with a series of frontal
systems set to move across the Pacific Northwest through the middle
of next week bringing multiple rounds of rain and mountain snow with
increasing intensity through the weekend and into next week. Current
snow levels around 2700 feet this evening will rise closer to 6000
to 7000 feet by Sunday and then closer to 8000 to 9000 feet Monday
evening as persistent atmospheric river moisture advects into the
Western Washington. Prolonged heavy rainfall will lead to rapid
rises on rivers Sunday into early next week, especially when
combined with melting snow as snow levels most notably rise Sunday
and Monday.
Numerous rivers are currently forecast to go into flood stage, some
from Moderate to near Major, starting with the Skokomish River in
Mason County late Saturday then eastward with many of the Cascade
Rivers by early next week. Excessive rainfall may also lead to
isolated residential and/or urban flooding.
