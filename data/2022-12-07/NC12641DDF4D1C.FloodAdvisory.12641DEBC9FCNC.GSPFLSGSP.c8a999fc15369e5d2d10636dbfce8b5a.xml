<headline>Flood Advisory issued December 07 at 3:31PM EST  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 915 PM EST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Nuisance flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of western North Carolina, including the
following county, Macon.
* WHEN...Until 915 PM EST.
* IMPACTS...Some low-water crossings may become impassable.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 321 PM EST, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated heavy rain. Nantahala River at Rainbow Springs has
exceeded action stage, and minor flooding is ongoing or
expected to begin shortly in the advisory area. At 4 feet,
the Nantahala River is flooding low-water crossings at Tate
Cove Rd and near Water Gauge Rd and Rainbow Springs Rd and is
beginning to strand residents or require lengthy detours into
Clay County. Between 1 and 2 inches of rain have fallen in
the last 12 hours.
- Additional rainfall amounts up to 1 inch are expected over
the area in the next three hours. This additional rain will
result in further rises in stage height...so the river is
unlikely to crest for several hours.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Nantahala River at Rainbow Springs.
