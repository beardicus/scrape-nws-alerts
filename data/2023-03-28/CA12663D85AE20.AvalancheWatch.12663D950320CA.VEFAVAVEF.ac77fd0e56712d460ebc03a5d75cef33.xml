<description>The Eastern Sierra Avalanche Center in Mammoth Lakes
has issued a Backcountry Avalanche Watch for the
following areas: the Eastern Sierra in Mono County and
the Eastern Sierra in Inyo County
* WHAT...The avalance danger is expected to rise to HIGH at all
elevations by 7 am PDT Wednesday, March 29th.
* WHERE...The eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range
between Virgina Lakes on the north to Bishop Creek on the
south.
* WHEN...In effect from 7 am Tuesday to 7 am PDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Periods of very heavy snowfall and strong winds will
create sensitive wind slabs and stress a weak upper snowpack.
Travel will be difficult. Expect widespread areas of unstable
snow.
* PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...Very dangerous avalanche
conditions will develop overnight. Avalanches may break widely
and run long distances and can run into mature forests, valley
floors or flat terrain.
Consult http://www.esavalanche.org or
www.avalanche.org for more detailed information
Similar avalanche danger may exist at locations outside the
coverage area of this or any avalanche center.</description>
