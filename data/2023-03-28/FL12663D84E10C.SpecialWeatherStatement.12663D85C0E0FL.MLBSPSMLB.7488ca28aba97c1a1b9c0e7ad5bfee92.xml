<description>...Locally Dense Fog Over Lake County...
At 530 AM, surface observations, satellite imagery, and traffic
cameras, showed patchy to areas of fog over much of Lake County.
Some locations have had visibilities drop below one mile, and as
low as 400 yards in a few spots. The fog is expected to continue
through sunrise and then dissipate between 9 and 10 AM.
If you will be out driving on the roads, prepare to encounter
rapid reductions in visibility due to dense fog. Slow down, use
your low beam headlights, and leave plenty of driving distance
between your car and the one in front of you.</description>
