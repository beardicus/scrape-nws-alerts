<description>...WINTER STORM BRINGS STRONGER WINDS WITH RAIN AND SNOW TODAY,
COLD AND SHOWERY WEDNESDAY...
* Gusty south to southwest winds will precede and accompany the
main cold front today. Widespread wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph in
valley locations with gusts exceeding 60 mph in wind prone areas
will likely bring difficulties for high profile vehicles,
aviation and boating activities. Please see the Wind Advisory
for additional details.
* For lower elevations of western Nevada and northeast California,
mostly light rainfall is expected as snow levels jump above 5500
feet during the day. Rain-snow lines will rapidly fall behind
the cold front this evening, so minor snow accumulations up to 2
inches will be possible for foothill locations and Virginia
City. The late March sun angle will limit accumulations on most
road surfaces in lower elevations.
* Tonight, a band of snow or a rain-snow mix could produce
accumulating snowfall and slick travel conditions for areas near
and east of US-95. This includes I-80 east of Lovelock and
Highway 50 east of Fallon. Elsewhere in western Nevada, roads
that start out wet this evening could develop icy patches
overnight especially on bridges or overpasses as temperatures
drop below freezing.
* Snow and pellet showers will develop Wednesday with a 25% chance
for any given location in western Nevada to see up to 1&quot; of snow
Wednesday afternoon and evening. Showers will be more prevalent
in the Sierra with 1-6&quot; of additional accumulation possible,
and a 15% chance for a rumble of thunder.</description>
