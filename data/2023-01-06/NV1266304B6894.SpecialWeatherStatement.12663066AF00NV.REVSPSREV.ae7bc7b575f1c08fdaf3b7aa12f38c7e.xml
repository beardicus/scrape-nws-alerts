<description>...SERIES OF WINTER STORMS WILL BRING IMPACTS TO PORTIONS OF
WESTERN NEVADA THROUGH MID-WEEK...
* A relatively weak system will move into the area Saturday
afternoon and evening hours. Outside of ridge tops, winds are
not expected to be a concern. A few light rain showers (or a
rain/snow mix) will be possible Saturday evening into the
overnight hours, mainly along and west of Highway 95.
Measurable precipitation will be minimal, if any.
* A second, stronger system will quickly arrive early Sunday.
Snowfall amounts of 1 inch or less will be possible early
Sunday, along and west of Highway 95 with little to no
accumulation elsewhere. Combined liquid totals from rain and
snow will generally be 0.15 inches or less across the area.
* A potent Atmospheric River is still expected to impact the area
Monday into Tuesday of next week. This system will bring copious
amounts of moisture and precipitation to the region. Along river
basins and cities that predominately see just rainfall, some
isolated urban and small stream flooding concerns is possible.
However, there remains some degree of uncertainty in snow
levels, especially on Monday during the onset of the storm.
Conditions are favorable for heavy/wet snow with high
precipitation rates on Monday particularly along and west of
Highway 95, even in the lowest valleys. With that said, there is
a chance that snow levels will remain just above major urban
centers. This will mean the difference of flooding concerns or
heavy/wet snowfall. Impacts are likely either way for many
locations, so it is advised to check roadway conditions before
the Monday morning commute.</description>
