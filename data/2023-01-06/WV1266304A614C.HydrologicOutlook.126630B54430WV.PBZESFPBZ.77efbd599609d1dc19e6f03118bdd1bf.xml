<headline>Hydrologic Outlook issued January 06 at 9:51AM EST  by NWS Pittsburgh</headline>
<description>...Flood Potential for the next two weeks is near to slightly
below normal for the Ohio Valley...
...Flood Potential for the next 90-days is near to slightly above
normal for the Ohio Valley...
PAST PRECIPITATION THE LAST 14 DAYS... Precipitation the last 14
days ranged from one and a half to four inches (100-300% of
normal).
For more information please visit:
https://water.weather.gov/precip
SOIL MOISTURE... Current early January soil moisture conditions
across the region continued to return toward normal after a drier
autumn.
State rankings:
Ohio - Near to slightly below normal
Western Pennsylvania - Near normal
West Virginia - Near normal
For more information please visit:
https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/Drought/Monitoring/smp.shtml
USGS STREAMFLOWS... USGS streamflow conditions for early January
have returned to near normal across much of the basin.
State rankings:
Ohio - Near to slightly below normal
Western Pennsylvania - Near normal
West Virginia - Near normal
For more information please visit:
https://watermonitor.gov
RESERVOIR CONDITIONS... Reservoir storage is ample across the
Ohio Valley with most reservoirs near winter pool levels.
OHIO RIVER FLOWS... Observed Ohio River streamflows are above
normal due to a recent heavy rain event but will be trending back
toward normal fairly quickly within the next week.
Values are in percent of normal with above 100% equaling above
normal and below 100% equaling below normal.
Pittsburgh - 225%
Huntington - 235%
Cincinnati - 250%
Louisville - 250%
Evansville - 110%
Smithland  -  95%
SNOW WATER CONTENT IN SNOWPACK... No significant snow is present
in the Ohio Valley. There is no risk for flooding due to snow
melt.
For more information please visit:
https://www.nohrsc.noaa.gov/nsa
ICE COVER... Much of the ice has broken up and gone away due to
the recent warmup. Ice is not a factor in flood potential in the
next several weeks.
2-WEEK AND 90-DAY FUTURE RAINFALL AND FLOOD OUTLOOK SUMMARY...
The two-week outlook calls for near or to slightly below normal
precipitation, generally 1-2 inches with some areas slightly above
or below this. Therefore, with a lack of snow and ice across the
region, flood potential is at or below normal due to new
precipitation the next two weeks.
OHIO RIVER AVERAGE FLOW FORECASTS THE NEXT 2 WEEKS... The Ohio
River flow forecasts are expected to $$
return toward normal the next
two weeks with a lack of a heavy rain event.
Values are in percent of normal with above 100% are above normal
and below 100% are below normal.
Pittsburgh - 100%
Huntington - 110%
Cincinnati - 110%
Louisville - 110%
Evansville - 110%
Smithland  - 115%

https://www.weather.gov/ohrfc
STATE BY STATE 90-DAY EXPECTED RIVER FLOOD RISK... Ohio - None to
minor flooding Western Pennsylvania - None to minor flooding West
Virginia - None to minor flooding
For more information on the 90-day flood risk please visit:
https://water.weather.gov/ahps/long_range.php
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION...
Flood risk is defined as follows:
Below normal - flooding will be limited Normal - minor flooding
in the typical locations Above normal - widespread flooding with
some moderate or major possible
Winter/spring flood outlooks are issued weekly by the National
Weather Service Ohio River Forecast Center during winter and early
spring to summarize basin hydrological and meteorological
conditions. It also assesses the potential for flood risk. The
outlooks are based on current and forecast conditions.
The Ohio River Forecast Center also issues a 30-90 day water
resources outlook monthly throughout the year for a continuous
water watch. This can be found at
https://www.weather.gov/ohrfc/wro .
Factor considered in assessing flood potential include antecedent
conditions, past precipitation, current streamflows and reservoir
levels, soil moisture, water content in snow cover, ice
conditions and future precipitation.</description>
