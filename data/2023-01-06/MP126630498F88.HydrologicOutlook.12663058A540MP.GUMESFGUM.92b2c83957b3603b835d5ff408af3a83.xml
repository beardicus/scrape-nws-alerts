<headline>Hydrologic Outlook issued January 06 at 7:14PM ChST  by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL POSSIBLE EARLY MONDAY MORNING THROUGH
TUESDAY EVENING...
This Hydrologic Outlook is for Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan in
the Mariana Islands.
A slowly-developing circulation will approach the Marianas from
the east-southeast early next week. As this occurs, a shear line
will sink slowly southeast and is expected to be positioned from
near Saipan to Rota`s western coastal waters. The interaction of
these two features will likely lead to periods of locally heavy
rainfall and gusty winds.
As for rainfall totals, current indications are for 3 to 6 inches
of rainfall to occur with localized amounts upwards of 8 to
perhaps 10 inches for Tinian and Saipan. Further south for Guam
and Rota, a solid 3 to 6 inches looks good at this point, but some
of the higher terrain across southern Guam and Rota could see a
few higher amounts.
Closely monitor this developing situation in the event watches,
advisories, or warnings are needed. Forecasts will likely change
to some extent in the next few days, mainly to make minor
adjustments to rainfall totals and perhaps timing.
Make sure nearby storm drains are not clogged, especially for
low-lying or flood-prone areas.</description>
