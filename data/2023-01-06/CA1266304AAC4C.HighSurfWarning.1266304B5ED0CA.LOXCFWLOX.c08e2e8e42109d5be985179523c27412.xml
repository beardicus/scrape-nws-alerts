<headline>High Surf Warning issued January 06 at 8:43AM PST until January 06 at 1:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM PST THIS
AFTERNOON...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM PST THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking
waves of 14 to 20 feet with dangerous rip currents. Sets up to
24 feet will be possible. For the Coastal Flood Advisory,
minor coastal flooding.
* WHERE...San Luis Obispo County Beaches and Santa Barbara
County Central Coast Beaches.
* WHEN...Until 1 PM PST this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely, around the time of
high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as
parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to
roads or structures is NOT expected. Powerful waves and strong
rip currents will pose an exceptional risk of ocean drowning
and damage to coastal structures like piers and jetties. Large
breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and
rocks, and capsize small boats near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The high tides will be near 5.8 feet
between 8 AM to 9 AM PST.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other water side
infrastructure.</instruction>
