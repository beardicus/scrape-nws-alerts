<description>...SERIES OF WINTER STORMS WILL BRING WIDESPREAD IMPACTS TO
THE AREA THROUGH MID-WEEK...
* A relatively weak system will move into the area Saturday. Light
snowfall accumulations of up to 2 inches is possible in the
remote portions of northern Washoe county, with light snow or
rain/snow mix at most other locations including the Surprise
Valley.
* A second system will quickly arrive early Sunday. Another 1 inch
or less of snowfall can be expected. Combined liquid totals from
rain and snow will generally be 0.15 inches or less across the
area.
* A potent Atmospheric River is still expected to impact the area
Monday into Tuesday of next week. This system will bring copious
amounts of moisture and precipitation to the region. Along river
basins and cities that predominately see just rainfall, urban
and small stream flooding concerns is likely. However, there is
a high degree of uncertainty in snow levels, especially on
Monday during the onset of the storm. Conditions are favorable
for heavy/wet snow with high precipitation rates on Monday, even
in the lowest valleys. With that said, there is an equal chance
that snow levels will remain elevated and we could see rounds of
heavy rainfall. This will mean the difference of more widespread
flooding concerns or heavy/wet snowfall. Impacts are likely
either way, so it is advised to check roadway conditions before
the Monday morning commute.</description>
