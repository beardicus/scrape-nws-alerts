<description>...WINTER STORM WILL BRING HEAVY SNOW, A WINTRY MIX, AND HAZARDOUS
TRAVEL THROUGH THURSDAY...
.A strong low pressure system will move across the Great Lakes,
spreading a wintry mix of snow, freezing rain and sleet across the
region today. The mixed precipitation will turn to all snow over
much of northern Wisconsin this afternoon and evening, with periods
of heavy snow expected tonight. East winds will also gust to 25 to
40 mph, which could combine with heavy snow accumulations to cause
tree and power line damage. Sporadic power outages will be possible.
Travel could become hazardous due to the snow and ice. Some
uncertainty remains on exact precipitation type and amounts as
temperatures will be near freezing.
...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM THIS EVENING TO 9 AM CST
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy wet snow expected. Total snow and sleet accumulations
between 4 and 7 inches. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Door County.
* WHEN...From 6 PM this evening to 9 AM CST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous conditions
could impact the Thursday morning commute.</description>
<instruction>Monitor the latest forecasts for updates on this situation.
People should consider delaying travel. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution. Consider taking a winter
storm kit along with you, including such items as tire chains,
booster cables, flashlight, shovel, blankets and extra clothing.
Also take water, a first aid kit, and anything else that would help
you survive in case you become stranded.</instruction>
