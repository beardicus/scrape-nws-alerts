<description>...LINGERING WINTER WEATHER IMPACTS OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND NORTHEAST
PLAINS...
.A strong winter storm system will continue to move slowly east
across the northern plains today. As the storm moves away from
Colorado, snowfall will be very limited, but strong winds will
continue especially across the northeastern plains. The winds will
continue to produce blowing and drifting snow. The worst conditions
will be from Sterling and Akron eastward, while conditions should
gradually improve west of Fort Morgan and Limon. Many roadways are
still closed as of early this morning, so people should check the
status of the highways before attempting travel. Some rural roads
may remain drifted in for some time as continued wind slows progress
on clearing them.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM MST THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Snow ongoing. Additional snow accumulations up to 4 inches.
Winds gusting as high as 60 mph over the higher passes.
* WHERE...Rabbit Ears Pass, Rocky Mountain National Park and the
Medicine Bow Range, and The Mountains of Summit County, the
Mosquito Range, and the Indian Peaks.
* WHEN...Until 5 PM MST this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Roads will remain slippery in some areas, along with
localized blowing and drifting snow in higher exposed areas.</description>
