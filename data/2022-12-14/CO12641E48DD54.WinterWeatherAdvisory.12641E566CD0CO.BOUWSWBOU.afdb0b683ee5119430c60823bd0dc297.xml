<description>...LINGERING WINTER WEATHER IMPACTS OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND NORTHEAST
PLAINS...
.A strong winter storm system will continue to move slowly east
across the northern plains today. As the storm moves away from
Colorado, snowfall will be very limited, but strong winds will
continue especially across the northeastern plains. The winds will
continue to produce blowing and drifting snow. The worst conditions
will be from Sterling and Akron eastward, while conditions should
gradually improve west of Fort Morgan and Limon. Many roadways are
still closed as of early this morning, so people should check the
status of the highways before attempting travel. Some rural roads
may remain drifted in for some time as continued wind slows progress
on clearing them.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM MST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Blowing snow ongoing. Winds gusting as high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...Julesburg, and Holyoke.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM MST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Areas of blowing snow could significantly reduce
visibility and cause continued drifting across roads.</description>
<instruction>Use caution while traveling, especially in open areas. Many roads
will be closed or impassable until they can be cleared. The latest
road conditions for Colorado can be obtained by calling 5 1 1 or by
going to www.cotrip.org.</instruction>
