<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AST FRIDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH FRIDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Dangerous surf conditions and rip currents expected due
to breaking waves around 12 feet. Localized beach erosion and
coastal flooding is possible.
* WHERE...Beaches along the northern coast of Puerto Rico,
Aguada, Rincon, Culebra, St. John and St. Thomas.
* WHEN...Through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming conditions. Rip currents can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper
water. Hazardous breaking waves.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A long period northeasterly swell
continues to invade and spread across the Atlantic waters and
local passages of the islands. This swell action will produce
larger breaking waves along the northern beaches of Puerto
Rico. Breaking waves are expected to reach around 12 feet, and
beach erosion is posible.</description>
<instruction>A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in
the advisory area, producing localized beach erosion and
dangerous swimming conditions.
There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.</instruction>
