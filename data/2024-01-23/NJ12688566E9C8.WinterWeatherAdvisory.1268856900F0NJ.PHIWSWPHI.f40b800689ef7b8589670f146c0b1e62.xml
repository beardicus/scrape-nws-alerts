<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM EST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Freezing rain. Additional ice accumulations of a light
glaze.
* WHERE...Morris.
* WHEN...Until 10 AM EST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Very slippery sidewalks, roads, and bridges are
possible. The hazardous conditions could impact the morning
commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Periods of light precipitation will
continue to affect the area through tonight into Wednesday
morning. While this may fall mainly as light rain over the
lower elevations, a wintry mix can be expected at elevations
above roughly 800 feet or so with freezing rain being the main
hazard. All areas will then see a change to rain Wednesday
morning as temperatures warm. Ice accumulation will vary with
the potential for several hundredths of an inch over the higher
terrain over the northwest part of the county with very little
in the lower elevations farther south and east.</description>
