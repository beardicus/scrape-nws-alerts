<headline>High Surf Advisory issued January 23 at 1:40PM PST until January 26 at 4:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM PST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Large breaking waves of 8 to 12 feet with dangerous rip
currents. Minor coastal flooding during morning high tides.
* WHERE...Central Coast beaches of San Luis Obispo County and
Santa Barbara Counties.
* WHEN...Until 4 PM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...There is an increased risk for ocean drowning. Rip
currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Large
breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and
rocks, and capsize small boats near shore. Pooling of sea water
is expected around the time of high tide over sandy beach areas
including bike paths and walkways. Significant damage is NOT
expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...High tides will peak near 6.3 to 6.8 feet
each morning between 7 AM and 9 AM.</description>
<instruction>Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
