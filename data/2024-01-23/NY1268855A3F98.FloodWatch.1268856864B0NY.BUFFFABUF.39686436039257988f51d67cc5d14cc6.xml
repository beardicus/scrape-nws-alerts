<senderName>NWS Buffalo (Western New York)</senderName>
<headline>Flood Watch issued January 23 at 1:30PM EST until January 24 at 6:00AM EST by NWS Buffalo</headline>
<description>.Several waves of rainfall, Wednesday and again Thursday night, will
produce a half to one inch of liquid. While a deeper snowpack will
absorb some of this rain, there will be snowmelt yielding additional
runoff into area creeks and streams, elevating their flow level.
Recent reports have indicated ice formation on the Buffalo area
creeks, as well as creeks and rivers in the western Southern Tier.
As creeks and rivers rise, a mild airmass well into the 40s, and
possibly lower 50s will encourage the creek and river ice to break,
eventually leading to possible ice jams and subsequent flooding.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH SATURDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and/or snowmelt and/or ice jam is
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of western New York, including the following
counties, Chautauqua, Northern Erie and Southern Erie. Creeks
especially prone to ice jams include: Cayuga Creek, Buffalo Creek,
Cazenovia Creek, Buffalo River as well as the Cattaraugus Creek
near Sunset Bay.
* WHEN...From Thursday afternoon through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks, especially if an
ice jam occurs. Ice jams may result in water infiltrating the low
lying lands along the creek and rivers paths.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The combination of snowmelt and rainfall runoff, with the
encouragement of ice breakage within creeks and rivers may
yield ice jam flooding.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
