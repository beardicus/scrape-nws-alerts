<description>...AREAS OF HEAVY SNOW THIS EVENING...
.Snow will spread into the mountains this morning, with scattered
rain showers developing on the plains this afternoon. As
temperatures cool this evening, widespread snow will develop on the
plains. The snow is expected to be heavy at times over the east
slopes of the Front Range and south of Denver. There is much
uncertainty about how much it will snow in Denver based on the
timing of the change to snow this evening and the exact location of
the area of heavy snow. In areas below 6000 feet, the impacts will
be reduced due to warm temperatures that will stay in the lower 30s
much of the night. However, areas of slushy roads and poor
visibility can be expected. In the foothills, roads may be slushy
this evening but will become snowpacked or icy by Thursday morning.
Expect impacts on the Thursday morning commute, especially in areas
west and south of Denver.
...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM THIS EVENING TO NOON MDT
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow. Total snow accumulations between 5 and 10
inches, with up to 15 inches in the foothills.
* WHERE...The Southern Front Range Foothills, Boulder and the
western suburbs of Denver, and Castle Rock.
* WHEN...Heavy snow will develop early this evening, diminishing
Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Snow covered roads will make travel hazardous. Travel
will be especially difficult from late this evening through the
Thursday morning rush hour in the foothills west and southwest of
Denver.</description>
<instruction>Be prepared for slow and dangerous travel and monitor road
conditions. Allow extra time to reach your destination.</instruction>
