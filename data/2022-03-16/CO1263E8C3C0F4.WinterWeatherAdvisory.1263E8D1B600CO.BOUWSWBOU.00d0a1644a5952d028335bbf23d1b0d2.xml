<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued March 16 at 2:53PM MDT until March 17 at 6:00AM MDT by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>...AREAS OF HEAVY SNOW THROUGH THURSDAY MORNING...
.Snow will spread into the mountains this morning, with scattered
rain showers developing on the plains this afternoon. As
temperatures cool this evening, widespread snow will develop on the
plains. The snow is expected to be heavy at times over the east
slopes of the Front Range and south of Denver. There is much
uncertainty about how much it will snow in Denver based on the
timing of the change to snow this evening and the exact location of
the area of heavy snow. In areas below 6000 feet, the impacts will
be reduced due to warm temperatures that will stay in the lower 30s
much of the night. However, areas of slushy roads and poor
visibility can be expected. In the foothills, roads may be slushy
this evening but will become snowpacked or icy by Thursday morning.
Expect impacts on the Thursday morning commute, especially in areas
west and south of Denver.

TO 6 AM MDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 4 and 10
inches.
