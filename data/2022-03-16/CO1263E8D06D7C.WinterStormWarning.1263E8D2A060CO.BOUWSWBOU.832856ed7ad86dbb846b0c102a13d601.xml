<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 16 at 9:59PM MDT until March 17 at 12:00PM MDT by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>...AREAS OF HEAVY SNOW THROUGH THURSDAY MORNING...
.As temperatures cool overnight, widespread snow will develop on the
plains. The snow is expected to be heavy at times over the east
slopes of the Front Range and south of Denver. There is much
uncertainty about how much it will snow in Denver based on the
timing of the change to snow this evening and the exact location of
the area of heavy snow. In areas below 6000 feet, the impacts will
be reduced due to warm temperatures that will stay in the lower 30s
much of the night. However, areas of slushy roads and poor
visibility can be expected. Roads may become snowpacked or icy by
Thursday morning. Expect impacts on the Thursday morning commute,
especially in areas west and south of Denver.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON MDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Moderate to heavy snow ongoing. Additional snow
accumulations between 3 and 5 inches.
* WHERE...Denver, and Byers.
* WHEN...Until Noon MDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous conditions
could impact the Thursday morning commute.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road conditions for
Colorado can be obtained by calling 5 1 1 or by going to www.cotrip.
