<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM TO 9 PM TODAY FOR PORTIONS
OF THE EDWARDS PLATEAU AND RIO GRANDE PLAINS...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH FROM 1 PM TO 10 PM THURSDAY FOR LOCATIONS
GENERALLY WEST OF A LINE FROM LLANO TO EAGLE PASS...
.Very dry air across the area will continue to remain in place
today, and somewhat be reinforced by a cold front moving into the
area on Thursday. Minimum afternoon relative humidity will drop
below 20 percent, and in some cases fall to single digits.
Meanwhile, light winds in the overnight hours and morning will
quickly increase and become gusty, as daytime heating promotes
mixing with stronger winds aloft.
The cold front moving into the area on Thursday will not bring
rain, but the dry air behind it will maintain low humidity, while
gusty winds will even be stronger, and continue past sunset into
Thursday evening. Fuels are still in a cured state from the end of
winter, and with little precipitation in the past few months,
conditions are tinder dry.
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO 9 PM
CDT THIS EVENING FOR WIND AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR PORTIONS
OF THE EDWARDS PLATEAU AND RIO GRANDE PLAINS...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
THURSDAY EVENING FOR WIND AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR PORTIONS

afternoon through Thursday evening.
* WINDS...South 15 to 25 mph with gusts up to 35 mph.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...As low as 8 percent.
* IMPACTS...Any wildfires ignited may spread rapidly and
unpredictably. Prevention of fire starts by avoiding planned
burning, or by limiting activities prone to produce sparks can
stop the start and spread of wildfires.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now....or will shortly. A combination of
strong winds...low relative humidity...and warm temperatures can
contribute to extreme fire behavior.
A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are forecast to occur. Listen for later forecasts and possible
Red Flag Warnings.</instruction>
