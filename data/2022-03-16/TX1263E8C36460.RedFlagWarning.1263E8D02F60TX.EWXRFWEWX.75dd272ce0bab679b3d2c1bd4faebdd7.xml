<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM TO 9 PM TODAY FOR
PORTIONS OF THE EDWARDS PLATEAU AND RIO GRANDE PLAINS...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH FROM 1 PM TO 10 PM THURSDAY FOR LOCATIONS
GENERALLY WEST OF A LINE FROM LLANO TO EAGLE PASS...
.Dry air with relative humidity values below 20 percent will
continue to remain in place today with moderate south-
southeasterly sustained winds of around 15 to 20 mph across
portions of the Rio Grande and southern Edwards Plateau. For
tonight, the low relative humidity values gradually recover
while wind speeds subside to around 5 to 15 mph.
A dryline will advance eastward during Thursday to near the
highway 281 corridor ahead of a weak pacific cold front that
evening. To the west of this dryline, critical fire weather
conditions will likely develop with relative humidity values
below 20 percent with shifting and increasings winds coming
out of the west. Sustained winds of 20 to 30 mph could be
possible with gusts up to 40 mph, especially over Val Verde
County. To the east of the dryline, relative humidity values
expected to be much higher.
Fuels are still in a cured state from the end of the winter
season, and with little precipitation in the past few months,
conditions are tinder dry.

PLATEAU AND RIO GRANDE PLAINS...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY AFTERNOON

are either occurring now....or will shortly. A combination of
strong winds...low relative humidity...and warm temperatures can
contribute to extreme fire behavior.
