<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued June 22 at 6:40PM PDT until June 22 at 8:45PM PDT by NWS Seattle</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Seattle has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
The Loch Katrine burn scar in...
Northeastern King County in west central Washington...
* Until 845 PM PDT.
* At 640 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing
heavy rain over the Loch Katrine Burn Scar. Between 0.5 and 1 inch
of rain has fallen. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin
shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through the burn scar area. The debris flow can consist of
rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms
producing flash flooding in and around the Loch
Katrine Burn Scar.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Life threatening flash flooding of areas in and around
the Loch Katrine Burn Scar.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
mainly rural areas of Northeastern King County
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>This is a life threatening situation. Heavy rainfall will cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks...streams...and
ditches in the Loch Katrine Burn Scar. Severe debris flows can also
be anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may be washed away
in places. If you encounter flood waters...climb to safety.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
