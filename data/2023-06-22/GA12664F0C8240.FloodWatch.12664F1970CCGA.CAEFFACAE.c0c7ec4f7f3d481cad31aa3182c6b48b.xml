<headline>Flood Watch issued June 22 at 2:40PM EDT until June 22 at 11:15PM EDT by NWS Columbia</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EDT TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of east central Georgia and central South
Carolina, including the following areas, in east central Georgia,
Burke, Columbia, Lincoln, McDuffie and Richmond. In central South
Carolina, Aiken, Bamberg, Barnwell, Calhoun, Central Orangeburg,
Chesterfield, Clarendon, Edgefield, Fairfield, Kershaw, Lee,
Lexington, McCormick, Newberry, Northern Lancaster, Northwestern
Orangeburg, Richland, Saluda, Southeastern Orangeburg, Southern
Lancaster and Sumter.
* WHEN...Until Midnight EDT tonight.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The upper low currently centered over Tennessee will drift
northeast into Ohio by daybreak Friday. This feature has
helped to maintain a moist environment across the forecast
area. Additionally the soils across the area are very
saturated from the recent widespread heavy rainfall and much
of the rainfall will runoff. The region has received rainfall
amounts from 2 to 4 inches with some higher amounts between 5
and 7 inches. Any showers or thunderstorms that develop
during the afternoon and evening hours will have the
potential to produce locally heavy rainfall and produce
localized flooding. Overall, rainfall amounts could range
from one half inch up to one inch, but locally heavier
rainfall amounts could range from 1 to 3 inches. The system
that has produced the prolonged wet weather will begin to
move off to the north-northeast Friday and into the weekend
and allow somewhat drier conditions across the region.
