<headline>Excessive Heat Warning issued June 22 at 3:47AM CDT until June 22 at 7:00PM CDT by NWS Brownsville</headline>
<description>...EXCESSIVE HEAT WARNING IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO 7 PM CDT
THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Dangerously hot conditions with heat index values 116 to
121 expected.
* WHERE...Hidalgo, Brooks, Inland Kenedy, Starr, and Inland
Willacy Counties.
* WHEN...From noon today to 7 PM CDT this evening. Peak heat index
is expected from 4 to 7 PM today.
* IMPACTS...Extreme heat and humidity will significantly
increase the potential for heat related illnesses,
particularly for those working or participating in outdoor
activities.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The Heat Advisory has been upgraded to an
Excessive Heat Warning for the expectation of 2 to 4 hours of
heat index 116 or higher. The cumulative effect of very hot and
humid days with sultry nights where heat index fails to fall
below 90 degrees compounds the impact of the heat on vulnerable
populations who may not have access to cooler locations. Heat
illness can be worsened by this effect, so at-risk people are
urged to seek relatives or cooling centers with air conditioning
overnight.</description>
<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances. At risk persons are urged to seek
relatives or cooling centers or similar until further notice.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
