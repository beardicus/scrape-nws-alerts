* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A low pressure system just west of the southern Appalachians
will keep deep moisture in place over the western Carolinas
today. Rounds of heavy rain showers, with a few embedded
thunderstorms, will cross the region from the south today
through this evening. Additional rainfall of 1 to 2 inches

several inches of rain this week. New flooding could develop
quickly in these circumstances.
