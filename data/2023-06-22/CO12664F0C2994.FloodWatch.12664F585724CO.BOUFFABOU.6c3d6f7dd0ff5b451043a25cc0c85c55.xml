Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Another round of strong to severe storms are expected again
this afternoon and evening. Some of these storms will produce
very heavy rain and the potential for flash flooding. In
addition, many areas received considerable rainfall last
night, where from 1 to over 3 inches of rain had fallen.
Soils are already saturated and won`t take much additional
rainfall to create problems.   Creeks and streams are already
running high as well.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.</instruction>
