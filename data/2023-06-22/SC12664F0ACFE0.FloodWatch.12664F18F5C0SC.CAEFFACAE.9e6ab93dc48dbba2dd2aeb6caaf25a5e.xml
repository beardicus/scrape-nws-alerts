<headline>Flood Watch issued June 22 at 3:28AM EDT until June 22 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Columbia</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of central South Carolina, including the
following areas, Chesterfield, Clarendon, Fairfield, Kershaw, Lee,
Northern Lancaster, Southeastern Orangeburg, Southern Lancaster
and Sumter.
* WHEN...Through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A deep area of low pressure over northern Alabama will move
slowly north through tonight. This will keep a deep plume of
moisture in place across the region. In addition, a frontal
boundary across the southeast Midlands will move northwest
into the Piedmont and the air mass will become unstable. This
will lead to numerous showers and thunderstorms. Heavy rain
is now possible across the north and east Midlands including
the Pee Dee. Therefore, the Flood Watch has been extended in
area. Some areas of the east Midlands have already received 2
to 4 inches of rain in a few areas over the past 48 hours and
the soils are saturated. Additional rainfall of 1 to 3 inches
will be possible through this evening.
