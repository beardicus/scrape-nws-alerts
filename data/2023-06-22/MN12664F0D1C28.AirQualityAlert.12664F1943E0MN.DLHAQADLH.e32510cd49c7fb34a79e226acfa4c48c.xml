<headline>Air Quality Alert issued June 22 at 5:34PM CDT  by NWS Duluth</headline>
<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH 9 PM CDT TONIGHT...
* WHAT...The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has issued an Air
Quality Alert for ozone pollution. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is
expected to reach the Orange or Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups
category.
* WHERE...Portions of north central Minnesota.
* WHEN...Through 9 PM CDT tonight.
* IMPACTS...Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease
(including asthma), heart disease, children and older adults, and
people who are active outdoors, may experience health effects.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS... Sunny skies, warm temperatures, and low
humidity will create an environment favorable for two types of
pollutants (Volatile Organic Compounds and Nitrogen Oxides) to
react in the air to produce ground-level ozone. Ozone levels are
expected to reach the orange air quality index (AQI) category, a
level considered unhealthy for sensitive groups, across north
central Minnesota.

<instruction>Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including
asthma), heart disease, children and older adults, and people who

exertion. Reduce or eliminate activities that contribute to air
pollution, such as outdoor burning, and use of residential wood
burning devices. Reduce vehicle trips and vehicle idling as much as
