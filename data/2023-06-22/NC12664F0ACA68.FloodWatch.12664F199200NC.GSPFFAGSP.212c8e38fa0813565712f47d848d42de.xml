<headline>Flood Watch issued June 22 at 3:14AM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of northeast Georgia, western North Carolina and
upstate South Carolina, including the following areas, in
northeast Georgia, Franklin, Habersham, Hart, Rabun and Stephens.
In western North Carolina, Macon, Southern Jackson and
Transylvania. In upstate South Carolina, Anderson, Central
Greenville, Cherokee, Greater Oconee, Greater Pickens, Greenville
Mountains, Northern Spartanburg, Oconee Mountains, Pickens
Mountains, Southern Greenville and Southern Spartanburg.
* WHEN...Through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water crossings may be
flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A low pressure system just west of the southern Appalachians
will
keep deep moisture in place over the western Carolinas and
northeast
Georgia today. Rounds of heavy rain showers, with a few
embedded thunderstorms, will cross the region from the south
today through
this evening. Additional rainfall of up to 1 to 2 inches are
expected over the area, with the highest amounts near the
mountains. This rain will fall on areas that have already
received several inches of rain this week. New flooding could
develop quickly in these circumstances.

<instruction>A Flood Watch for flash flooding means there is a potential for
rapid onset flooding based on current forecasts. Flash flooding is a
very dangerous situation and may impact areas that do not typically
flood. Please monitor the latest forecasts and be prepared to take
action quickly should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.
Rainfall of more than five inches in similar storms has been
associated with an increased risk of landslides and rockslides. If
you live on a mountainside or in a cove at the base of a mountain,
especially near a stream, be ready to leave in advance of the storm
or as quickly as possible should rising water, moving earth, or
rocks threaten. Consider postponing travel along mountain roads
during periods of heavy rainfall.
Low-lying areas adjacent to streams, including campgrounds, are
especially vulnerable to flooding. If you live or are vacationing
next to a stream, please have a plan in place to seek higher ground
once heavy rainfall develops. Flash floods can occur quickly and
overwhelm adjacent low-lying areas with little warning. Once the
stream starts to rise, you may only have minutes to evacuate. Flash
floods can cause catastrophic damage and be powerful enough to sweep
away campers, vehicles, and mobile homes. Consider temporarily
relocating away from streams until the heavy rainfall threat passes.</instruction>
