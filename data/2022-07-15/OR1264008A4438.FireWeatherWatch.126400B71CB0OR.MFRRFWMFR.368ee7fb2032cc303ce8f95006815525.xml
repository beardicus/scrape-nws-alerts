<description>...Strong winds with low RH possible Saturday and Sunday...
.An upper level trough will approach the region Saturday into
Sunday. This will bring increased winds Saturday afternoon, and
Sunday afternoon, that will combine with very low relative
humidities resulting in possible critical fire weather conditions.

STRONG GUSTY WIND WITH LOW RH FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONES 285 AND 624...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH

ZONES 285 AND 624...
The National Weather Service in Medford has issued a Red Flag
Warning for Saturday afternoon and evening, and a Fire Weather
Watch for Sunday afternoon and evening...
* Impacts:  Strong, gusty wind with low relative humidity and
critically dry vegetation will greatly increase the spread
potential of any new and existing fires.
* Affected area:
In Northern CA Fire Zone....285. For the Red Flag Warning this includes
the communities of Alturas, Likely, and Tionesta. For the Fire
Weather Watch, this includes mainly the Warner Mountain range,
including Davis Creek and Willow Ranch.
In South Central OR Fire Zone....624. For the Red Flag Warning this
includes the communities of Lakeview and Valley Falls. The Fire
Weather Watch includes almost the same area.
* Wind: West 10 to 20 mph with gusts up to 30 mph.
* Humidity: As low as 8 percent.
* Additional Details: For the Fire Weather Watch in CA-FWZ-285,
critically low humidities are expected over the whole zone,
including Alturas. Winds are not forecast to meet criteria except
in isolated areas across the central portion of the zone. If
winds trend stronger, the area of critical fire weather
conditions will need to be expanded.

Precautionary/preparedness actions...
Avoid tossing burning cigarettes on the ground, parking hot
vehicles on dry vegetation, and using equipment that can cause
sparks. Follow all fire restrictions. Find links to restrictions
at weather.gov/medford/wildfire. One less spark, one less
wildfire.
Familiarize yourself with your evacuation plan. Where will you go?
How will you get there? Who will you call to let others know your
are safe? Visit ready.gov/wildfires for more information.
Gather your fire evacuation kit now. Collect essentials you don`t
want to lose and prioritize your checklist. Visit ready.gov/kit
for more information.
A Red Flag Warning does not mean there is a fire. It means that
critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now or will
shortly. These conditions promote rapid spread of fire which may
become life threatening. Evacuate if ordered to, or if a fire
threatens.
A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are possible during the valid watch time. These conditions could
promote the rapid spread of wildfires which could become life-
threatening. Check weather.gov/medford for forecast updates and a
possible upgrade of the this watch to a Red Flag Warning.
