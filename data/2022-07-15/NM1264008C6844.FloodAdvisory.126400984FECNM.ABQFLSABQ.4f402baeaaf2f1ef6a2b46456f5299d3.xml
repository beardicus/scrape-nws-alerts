<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Both localized and distant heavy rainfall will create sudden and
dangerous flows in arroyos and over low water crossings.
Remember, ditches are deadly. A gentle flow of water can become a
raging torrent in a few minutes.</instruction>
