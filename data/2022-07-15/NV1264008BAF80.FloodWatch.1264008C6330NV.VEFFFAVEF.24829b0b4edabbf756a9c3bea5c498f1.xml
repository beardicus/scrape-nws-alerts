<headline>Flood Watch issued July 15 at 11:40AM PDT  by NWS LasVegas</headline>
<description>.High monsoonal moisture over the region will result in afternoon
thunderstorms that could produce very heavy rainfall, especially in
high terrain areas of east-central and southern Nevada. Rainfall
rates of over 1 inch per hour could result from these thunderstorms
in these locations. Lower elevation areas will also see
thunderstorms today but flash flood risk is expected to be more
marginal in nature.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM PDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall in
thunderstorms is possible.
* WHERE...Lincoln County in south-central Nevada.
* WHEN...Until 11 PM PDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Heavy rainfall in high terrain areas could rapidly result in
flowing flood waters in lower lying areas such as slot canyons and
valley washes. Strong gusty winds over 50 mph will also be
possible with these thunderstorms.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
