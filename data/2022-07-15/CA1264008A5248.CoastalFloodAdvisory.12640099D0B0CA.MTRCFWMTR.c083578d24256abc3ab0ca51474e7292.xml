<description>...KING TIDES WILL CAUSE MINOR COASTAL FLOODING AT LOW LYING
SPOTS DURING HIGH TIDE EARLY SATURDAY MORNING...
.The highest astronomical tides of the year, commonly referred to
as the King Tides, have impacted the coast and bayshore this past
week. Though the peek was Thursday morning localized flooding of
specific low lying areas is still possible early Saturday morning
during high tide. In addition, the lowest low tides of the event
will be observed during later Saturday morning which may lead to
trouble for mariners navigating shallow waterways.
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 11 PM THIS EVENING TO
4 AM PDT SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Minor coastal flooding expected at prone low lying
coastal locations across the San Francisco Bay shoreline during
peak high tide tonight.
* WHERE...Low lying portions of the San Francisco Bayshore.
Localized impacts are also possible in low lying areas along
the Pacific shore as well.
* WHEN...From 11 PM this evening to 4 AM PDT Saturday. Please
refer to local tidal data forecasts available for several
coastal and bayshore locations at www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of areas previously impacted by King Tide
events is expected, including low lying lots, parks, and roads
throughout the San Francisco Bay Shoreline with the highest high
tides. Difficulty navigating shallow bay waters during the
lowest low tides.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Tidal levels will also rise along the
Pacific coast but impacts will be more localized to areas along
the SF Bay shoreline. Tide poolers and beachgoers should be
familiar with the times and heights of local tidal levels to
avoid hazards that may arise from rapidly shifting water levels.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
