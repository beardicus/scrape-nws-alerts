<headline>Flood Warning issued April 13 at 10:32AM CDT until further notice by NWS Eastern ND and Grand Forks</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Grand Forks ND has issued a Flood
Warning for the following rivers in Minnesota...
Red Lake River at Crookston affecting Polk County.
Two Rivers River near Hallock affecting Kittson County.
.Temperatures above freezing over the last several days is creating
snow melt, with some areas in the southern basin seeing most of the
snowpack melted. High temperatures will remain above freezing and is
expected to further ripen the snow pack where it still exists and,
with anticipated melting, will cause increased flows of water into
the rivers. There will be variations as to degree of snow melt
depending on how high temperatures will get over the next several
days. This will impact rate of rise in many locations, with some
rivers responding quickly and other forecast points seeing a delay
in rising levels. At this time, precipitation will be limited.
However, if rainfall occurs later over the next few days, it will
have an impact on forecast rises.
