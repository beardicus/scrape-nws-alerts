<description>...Red Flag Warning in Central and Parts of East Central
Wisconsin through Early Evening...
...Fire Weather Watch in Central Wisconsin on Friday...
.Record or near record warm temperatures, combined with winds
gusting to 25 mph and relative humidity falling to 20 to
25 percent, will produce critical fire weather conditions across
portions of central and east central Wisconsin through early
evening. Similar conditions are anticipated over central Wisconsin
on Friday, so a Fire Weather Watch has been issued there.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM CDT THIS EVENING
FOR CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS FOR THE WESTERN FOX VALLEY...
* AFFECTED AREA...Outagamie and Winnebago.
* TIMING...Until 8 PM CDT this evening.
* WINDS...Southwest 12 to 17 mph with gusts up to 25 mph.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...As 22 TO 27 percent.
* TEMPERATURES...In the lower 80s.
* IMPACTS...Fires will start easily and spread quickly in these
conditions, so outdoor burning should not be attempted. Visit
the Wisconsin DNR website to view current burning restrictions.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning is issued when critical fire weather
conditions are either occurring now, or are imminent. A
combination of strong winds, very low relative humidity, warm
temperatures and exceptionally dry fuels will create dangerous
wildland fire conditions. Persons are urged to be careful with
any activities that could potentially lead to a wildland fire.
Campfires, outdoor grills, smoking materials, chain saws, and all-
terrain vehicles all have the potential to throw a spark and
ignite a dangerous and destructive fire.
Please advise the appropriate officials or fire crews in the
field of this red flag warning.</instruction>
