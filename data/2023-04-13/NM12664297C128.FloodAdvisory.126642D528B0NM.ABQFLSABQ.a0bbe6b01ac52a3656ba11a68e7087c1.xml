<description>...The National Weather Service in Albuquerque has issued a Flood
Advisory for the following rivers in New Mexico...
Pecos River Above Pecos affecting San Miguel County.
.Warm temperatures will melt snowpack and increase river flows.

MONDAY AFTERNOON...

* WHERE...Pecos River above Pecos.

FLOODING AS DEBRIS ACCUMULATES ALONG THE UPSTREAM SIDES OF
BRIDGES. FURTHER WATER LEVEL RISES MAY MAKE PRIVATE BRIDGES UNSAFE
TO CROSS AND ISOLATE RESIDENTS.
At 6.0 feet, WATER THREATENS THOSE CABINS AND HOMES NEAREST THE
RIVER ALONG THE UPPER PECOS. THE PECOS RIVER ABOVE THE TOWN OF
PECOS HAS NOT BEEN THIS HIGH SINCE 1929. PORTIONS OF STATE ROAD 63
ABOVE THE FISH HATCHERY MAY BE IMPASSABLE DUE TO WATER OVER THE
ROAD. PRIVATE BRIDGES ON THE UPPER PECOS RIVER ABOVE THE TOWN OF
PECOS MAY BECOME IMPASSABLE OR FACE THE THREAT OF BEING WASHED
AWAY BY THE FAST FLOWING WATER.
