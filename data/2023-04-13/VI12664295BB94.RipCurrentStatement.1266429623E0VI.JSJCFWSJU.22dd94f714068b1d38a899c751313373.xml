<headline>Rip Current Statement issued April 13 at 3:33AM AST until April 13 at 6:00AM AST by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM AST EARLY
THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Life-threatening rip currents due to breaking waves up
to 6 to 7 feet.
* WHERE...Beaches of Saint Thomas, Saint John, and Adjacent
islands.
* WHEN...Through 6 AM AST this morning
* IMPACTS...Rip currents that can sweep even the best swimmers
away from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.</instruction>
