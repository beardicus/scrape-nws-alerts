<headline>Extreme Fire Danger issued April 13 at 2:55AM CDT  by NWS Sioux Falls</headline>
<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO 8 PM CDT THIS
EVENING FOR WIND AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR PORTIONS OF
SOUTHEAST SOUTH DAKOTA, NORTHWEST IOWA, AND SOUTHWEST
MINNESOTA...
.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 247 AM CDT Thu Apr 13 2023
The cold front that is currently draped across the
heart of the coverage area should lift back northwest this afternoon
with another very warm and dry day ahead of it. Afternoon minimum RH
values look to fall into at least the 20-25% range, perhaps a bit
lower if the better mixed RAP/HRRR continue to verify. At the same
time, southerly winds will gust as high as 30-40+ mph, highest
across NW IA. This will result in critical and dangerous fire
weather conditions across much of the coverage area, with rapid
spread of any new fire starts. Previously issued Red Flag Warning
still looks fully justified and did expand an additional row of
counties on the northern/western flank. Biggest questions still
revolve around the exact placement of the front by afternoon as
well as the fuel conditions closer to the Hwy 14 corridor and
along the Buffalo Ridge where snowmelt was more recent. Will want
to monitor these locations closely as critical meteorological
conditions may extend outside of the current warning, fuel status
is just the uncertainty.
A sharp cold front will push through Friday bringing falling
temperatures and precipitation chances.
People are urged to exercise extreme care with respect to outdoor
activities that could cause grass fires. Avoid equipment that can
cause sparks near dry grass or brush. Do not toss cigarettes on
the ground. Report new fires quickly to the nearest fire
department or law enforcement office.
...EXTREME FIRE DANGER...
The Grassland Fire Danger Index will reach the extreme category
this afternoon. Extreme weather conditions and very low
moisture content of grasses, and other dry organic material
on the ground, indicate that critical burning conditions exist.
All fires have the potential to become large and spread quickly,
becoming erratic with extreme behavioral characteristics.
No outdoor burning should take place.
OUTLOOK FOR FRIDAY AFTERNOON...The Grassland Fire Danger Index
will reach the high category.
The grassland fire danger product reflects fire danger for native
grasses. It is not intended for cured agricultural crops, nor
will it reflect conditions in road ditches which have been mowed.</description>
