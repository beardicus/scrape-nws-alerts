<instruction>Flooding is occurring. Most flood related deaths occur in
automobiles. Do not attempt to cross water covered bridges, dips, or
low water crossings. Never try to cross a flowing stream, even a
small one, on foot. To escape rising water find another route over
higher ground.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Caution is urged when walking near riverbanks.
