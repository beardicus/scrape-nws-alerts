<description>...FLOOD WARNING FOR SNOWMELT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM CDT/NOON
MDT/ FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by snowmelt continues.
* WHERE...Montrail, portions of McLean, Mercer, Morton, Grant, and
Sioux
* WHEN...Until 100 PM CDT Friday /noon MDT Friday/.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring from snowpack
melting. Numerous roads remain closed due to flooding.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 937 PM CDT /837 PM MDT/, emergency management reported
Rapid snowmelt is occurring and will continue to cause
flooding. In addition, the snowpack has been soaking
into the ground and the upper portions of soils are becoming
saturated. Areas that have appreciable snowpack remaining
will see additional    runoff in the coming days as the
ponding water eventually makes its way through frozen
culverts and into the waterways. County and township roads
may flood due to high water and plugged culverts.
- Mainly rural areas will be affected, but towns and cities may
also experience localized flooding issues</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.</instruction>
