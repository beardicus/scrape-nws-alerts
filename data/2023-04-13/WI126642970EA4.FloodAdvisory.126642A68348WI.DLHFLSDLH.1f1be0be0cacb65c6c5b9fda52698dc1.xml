<headline>Flood Advisory issued April 13 at 11:01AM CDT  by NWS Duluth</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY FOR SNOWMELT NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 1230 PM CDT
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by snowmelt continues.
* WHERE...A portion of northwest Wisconsin, including the following
areas, Ashland, Bayfield, Douglas and Iron.
* WHEN...Until 1230 PM CDT Friday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding and ponding of water in low-lying and
poor drainage areas. River or stream levels are elevated.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1057 AM CDT, Spring snow melt will continue with above
normal temperatures into Saturday. A near record amount of
water stored in the snowpack will continue to be released.
This will cause rapid snowmelt runoff and lead to ponding of
water and quick rises on streams and rivers. Minor flooding
is expected in the advisory area.
- If you live in an area that has previously experienced spring
flooding impacts, expect to experience those problems again
this year.
- Flood safety information can be found at
www.weather.gov/safety/flood.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and to the National Weather Service in Duluth when you
can do so safely. Flooding can be reported to the National Weather
Service at 1-800-685-8612.</instruction>
