.Temperatures above freezing over the last several days is creating
snow melt, with some areas in the southern basin seeing most of the
snowpack melted. High temperatures are forecast to remain above
freezing and is expected to further ripen the snow pack where it
still exists and, with anticipated melting, will cause increased
flows of water into the rivers.  There will be variations as to
degree of snow melt depending on how high temperatures will get over
the next several days. This will impact rate of rise in many
locations, with some rivers responding quickly and other forecast
points seeing a delay in rising levels. At this time, precipitation
will be limited. However, if rainfall occurs later over the next few
days, it will have an impact on forecast rises.
