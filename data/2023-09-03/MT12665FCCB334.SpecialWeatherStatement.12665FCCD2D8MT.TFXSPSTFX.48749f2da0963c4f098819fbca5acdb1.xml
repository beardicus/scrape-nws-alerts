<instruction>If outdoors, especially those camping, consider seeking sturdy
shelter, including inside a building, until these storms pass.
Heavy rainfall of up to a half inch in a half hour is also possible
with some of these storms. This may lead to minor localized flooding
and debris flow down steep slopes. Do not drive your vehicle through
flooded roadways.
Frequent cloud to ground lightning is occurring with these storms.
Lightning can strike 10 miles away from a thunderstorm. Seek a safe
shelter inside a building or vehicle.
These storms may intensify, so be certain to monitor local radio
stations and available television stations for additional
information and possible warnings from the National Weather Service.
If on or near Canyon Ferry Lake, please stay out of the water and
remain indoors or inside a vehicle until you no longer hear thunder.
If you can hear thunder, you are close enough to be struck by
lightning.</instruction>
