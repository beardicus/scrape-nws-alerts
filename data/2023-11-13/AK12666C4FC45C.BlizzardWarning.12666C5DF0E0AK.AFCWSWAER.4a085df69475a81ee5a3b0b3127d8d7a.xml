<headline>Blizzard Warning issued November 13 at 4:11AM AKST until November 13 at 9:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO
9 PM AKST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions expected. North winds gusting 35 to
50 mph. Total snow accumulation of 6 to 10 inches.
* WHERE...Thompson Pass.
* WHEN...From 1 PM to 9 PM AKST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be difficult. Falling and blowing snow
will produce white-out conditions at times.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow will continue through this afternoon.
Winds will shift from easterly to northerly in the early
afternoon and rapidly strengthen leading to development of
blizzard conditions. Even though snow will end by late
afternoon, continued gusty winds will lead to a ground blizzard
and drifting snow to persist through the evening hours.</description>
<instruction>A Blizzard Warning means severe winter weather conditions are
expected or occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds
and poor visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout
conditions, making travel very hazardous. If you must travel,
have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded, stay
with your vehicle.
For the latest road conditions call 5 1 1 or visit
