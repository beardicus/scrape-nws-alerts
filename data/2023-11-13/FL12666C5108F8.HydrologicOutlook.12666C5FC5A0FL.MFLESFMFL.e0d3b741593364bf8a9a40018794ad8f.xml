<description>...Heavy Rainfall Possible Eastern Areas Of South Florida Middle
Of This Week...
A frontal boundary will move northward from the Florida Straits
into South Florida during the middle of this week, as a non-
tropical low moves eastward from the northern Gulf of Mexico into
Northern Florida Peninsula. This will allow for the steering flow
to become southwest with surface winds being east northeast over
the region.
This weather pattern will allow for deep tropical moisture to work
into South Florida from the Southern Gulf of Mexico and the
Caribbean Sea. The latest model guidance is showing the PWAT
values rising to around 2.1 to 2.2 inches for middle of this week
which is near the maximum values for this time of year over South
Florida.
Therefore, any showers or thunderstorms that do develop over the
eastern areas of South Florida during the middle of this week
will be capable of producing heavy rainfall. At this time, it
looks like rainfall amounts could range between 2 to 4 inches over
the eastern areas of South Florida, but there could be localized
amounts up to 8 inches where any showers or thunderstorms train
over the same area.
The Weather Prediction Center has also put South Florida in a
Marginal Risk of Flooding for middle of this week, but will
continue to monitor the latest forecast to see if the flooding
risk needs to to be upgraded to slight risk in later forecast.</description>
