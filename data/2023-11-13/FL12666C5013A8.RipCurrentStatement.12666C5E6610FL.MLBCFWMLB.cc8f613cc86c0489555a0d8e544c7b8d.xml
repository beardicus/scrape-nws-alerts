<headline>Rip Current Statement issued November 13 at 10:14AM EST until November 14 at 4:00AM EST by NWS Melbourne</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE TONIGHT...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 AM EST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, water runup to the dune
line, minor coastal flooding and beach erosion expected around
the times of high tide, especially in vulnerable locations of
Martin County. For the High Rip Current Risk, rough choppy surf
and dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Coastal Indian River, Coastal Saint Lucie, Coastal
Martin, Mainland Southern Brevard and Southern Brevard Barrier
Islands Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through late tonight.
For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 11 AM EST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Some flooding of low-lying lots, parks and roadways
may occur near the shoreline. Only isolated road closures are
expected. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Morning high tides will occur between 800
and 830 AM on Tuesday, and around 900 AM Wednesday.</description>
<instruction>Onshore winds and above normal tides will combine to generate
flooding of low areas along the shore. Do not drive around
barricades or through water of unknown depth. Take the necessary
actions to protect flood-prone property.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as jetties and
piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If caught in a rip current, relax and float. Don`t swim against
the current. If able, swim in a direction following the shoreline.
If unable to escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
