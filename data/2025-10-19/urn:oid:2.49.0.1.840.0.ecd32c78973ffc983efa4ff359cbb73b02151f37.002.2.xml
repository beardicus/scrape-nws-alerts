13 feet. For the HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK, life-threatening rip
current.

* WHERE... For the HIGH SURF ADVISORY, the most vulnerable areas
for high surf and beach erosion include the north-facing
beaches. For the HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK, St Thomas, St John and
Adjacent Islands.

Rough surf may also knock you down. Large breaking waves will
result in localized beach/dune structure erosion and dangerous
swimming conditions. FOR THE HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK, rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water, where it becomes difficult to return to safety.
</description>
        <instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.

Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.

If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.

A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in
the advisory area, producing localized beach erosion and
dangerous swimming conditions.</instruction>
