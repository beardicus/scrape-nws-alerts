        <headline>Air Quality Alert issued July 7 at 3:58PM PDT by NWS San Diego CA</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...The South Coast AQMD has issued an air quality alert due to
harmful levels of ozone pollution.

* WHERE...In inland Orange County, the Santa Ana Mountains, the
Inland Empire, the San Bernardino Mountains, the Riverside County
mountains and the Coachella Valley. Levels of ozone pollution can
vary by time and location depending on emissions and air pollution
transport.

* WHEN...Monday 2:30 PM until Thursday 8:00 PM. The highest ozone
levels typically occur in the afternoon and early-evening hours.

* IMPACTS...Ozone air pollution can cause serious health problems,
including trouble breathing, asthma attacks, and lung damage.
Everyone can be affected, but sensitive groups such as people with
lung disease, older adults, people who are pregnant, children, and
those who spend a lot of time outdoors are at greater risk.
</description>
        <instruction>To protect your health, check air quality levels and act as needed:

* When Air Quality Index (AQI) levels are "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups"
(orange), sensitive groups as specified above should limit
extended or intense outdoor activity.
* When AQI is "Unhealthy" (red), everyone may experience health
impacts. Sensitive groups should avoid extended time outdoors.
* When AQI is "Very Unhealthy" (purple), sensitive groups should avoid
all outdoor physical activity. Everyone else should avoid
extended or intense outdoor activity.
* When AQI is "Hazardous" (maroon), everyone should avoid all
outdoor physical activity.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...

To help keep indoor air clean when air quality is poor:

* Keep windows and doors closed
* Run your air conditioner and/or an air purifier
* Do not use whole house fans or swamp coolers that bring in
outside
air if you have other methods to stay cool
* Avoid other sources of pollution such as fireplaces, candles,
incense, and grilling

To help minimize outdoor ozone air pollution levels:

* Limit the use of gasoline powered lawn and garden equipment until
evening hours
* Try to delay trips to the gas station and the use of household
chemicals until the evening
