<headline>Flood Warning issued July 02 at 10:30AM CDT  by NWS Duluth</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt continues.
* WHERE...Shoreline areas of Namakan, Kabetogama, and Rainy lakes in
northern Minnesota, as well as lower reaches of streams and rivers
which empty into those lakes.
* WHEN...Until further notice.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring. Several
structures are flooded and some sand bagging operations are
continuing. Numerous roads remain closed due to flooding.
Low-water crossings are inundated with water and may not be
passable. Expect many areas of slow moving or standing water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1025 AM CDT, Saturday, emergency management reported
ongoing extensive flooding across the warned area.
- Namakan and Kabetogama lakes were at 1119.0 feet as of the
morning of July 2, which is 18 inches, or 1.5 feet, below the
peak level reached in 2014. The level of Namakan and
Kabetogama lakes is expected to fall by 8 to 11 inches by
July 6, at which time the level would be within the
International Joint Commission regulated levels. Namakan and
Kabetogama lakes level has fallen 43 inches, or 3.6 feet,
since the crest on May 31.
Rainy Lake was at 1111.9 feet as of the morning of July 2,
which is 6.6 inches above the 2014 peak and 12.5 inches below
the previous record set in 1950. The level of Rainy Lake is
expected to fall by 13 to 16 inches by July 8. Rainy Lake
Lake levels have fallen 16 inches since the crest on June 15.
Widespread heavy rainfall over these basins would slow the
rate of recession, but will not stop the recessions.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
International Falls, Kabetogama, Crane Lake, Kabetogama Lake,
Voyageurs National Park, Rainy Lake East, Rainy Lake West,
northwestern Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, Ranier,
Ray, Island View, Ericksburg, Johnson Lake, and Sand Point
Lake.
