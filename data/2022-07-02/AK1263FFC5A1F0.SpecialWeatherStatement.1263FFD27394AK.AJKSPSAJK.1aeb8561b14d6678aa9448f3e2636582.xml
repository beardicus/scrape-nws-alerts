<description>...ANOTHER HEAT WAVE THIS HOLIDAY WEEKEND INTO EARLY
NEXT WEEK...
Widespread hot temperatures are expected to develop again late this
weekend across the Inner Channels with highs from the upper 70s
into the 80s. Locations away from the water will be the warmest.
Daily high temperature records will likely fall in some areas. At
this point the warmest conditions for Ketchikan and the southern
Inner Channels look to be Sunday into Monday, the Fourth of July.
For the northern and central Inner Channels including Juneau,
Petersburg, and Wrangell, the hottest days will likely be Monday
the Fourth of July and Tuesday.
To minimize impacts of the heat wave, locate fans for cooling;
wear light-colored and loose fitting clothes when outdoors; drink
plenty of fluids, apply sun protection, and take breaks if you
must be outdoors for extended periods; do not leave young children
and pets unattended in closed vehicles; and plan to check on the
elderly, those who are home-bound, and other loved ones and
neighbors who could be more vulnerable.
The very warm temperatures will continue to cause snow and ice
melt to keep larger rivers systems at high levels. This weather
pattern has been known to favor thunderstorm potential during
late afternoons and evenings and that potential will continue to
be monitored.</description>
