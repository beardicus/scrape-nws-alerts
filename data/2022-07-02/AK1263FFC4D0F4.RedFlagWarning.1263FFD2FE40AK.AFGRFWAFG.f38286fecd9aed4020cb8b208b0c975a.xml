<description>...Significant Lightning Over Eastern Interior today, Sunday and Monday...
.Hot, dry and smokey conditions over the Interior will persist
into Mon with isolated to scattered thunderstorms in the
afternoon/evenings. Moisture will increase from the south over the
next several days and cause thunderstorms to increase in number
and expand to the north and west through Sunday, and remain over
most of the Interior and North Slope Sunday into Mon. Expect
2000-3000 lightning strokes today, and 5000-10,000 strokes Sun and
Mon. The greatest density of thunderstorms and lightning will be
between Northway to Bettles today, and from Eagle to Tanana to
Anaktuvuk Pass on Sun and Mon. Thunderstorms will be mainly dry
today, with 15-40% chance of rain hitting the ground on Sun and
Mon. Will likely extend the Red Flag Warning for lightning into
Sun and possibly Mon for the same area and extend it into zone

Interior today, while the Western Interior is 30-45%. Min RH will
increase slightly Sun and Mon.
