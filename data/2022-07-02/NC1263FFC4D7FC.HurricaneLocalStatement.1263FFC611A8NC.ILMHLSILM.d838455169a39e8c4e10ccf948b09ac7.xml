SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
The center of Tropical Storm Colin is now pushing offshore of the
South Carolina Grand Strand region. Colin will continue to move to the
northeast through this afternoon and evening, hugging the North
Carolina coastline. The main impacts remain limited to the coast, and
include moderate to heavy rainfall, gusty winds, and strong rip
currents along local beaches.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Locally hazardous rainfall may bring limited impacts across southeast
North Carolina, particularly in areas close to the coast. Potential
impacts include:
- Localized flooding from rainfall may occur, especially in
low-lying and poor drainage areas. Some rivers and creeks may
rise as a result of the rain. Small streams, creeks, and
ditches may overflow in some locations.
- Several storm drains and retention ponds may become full and
begin to overflow. Some brief road closures are possible.
Elsewhere across southeast North Carolina and northeast South
Carolina, little to no impact is anticipated.
* WIND:
Hazardous wind may bring limited impacts across southeast North
Carolina, particularly in areas close to the coast. Potential impacts
include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes is possible. Unsecured lightweight objects may be
blown about.
- Some large limbs may break from trees. A few shallow rooted or
weak trees may snap or be knocked down. Some fences and roadway
signs damaged.
- A few roads may become impassable due to debris, particularly
within urban or heavily wooded locations. Hazardous driving
conditions are possible, especially for high profile vehicles
on bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages are possible.
Elsewhere across southeast North Carolina and northeast South
Carolina, little to no impact is anticipated.
