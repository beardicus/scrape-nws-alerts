POTENTIAL IMPACTS

Protect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across southeast North Carolina and northeast South

- Localized flooding from rainfall may occur, especially in
low-lying and poor drainage areas. Some rivers and creeks may
rise as a result of the rain. Small streams, creeks, and
ditches may overflow in some locations.

begin to overflow. Some brief road closures are possible.

Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
areas close to the coast. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes is possible. Unsecured lightweight objects may be
blown about.
- Some large limbs may break from trees. A few shallow rooted or
weak trees may snap or be knocked down. Some fences and roadway
signs damaged.
- A few roads may become impassable due to debris, particularly
within urban or heavily wooded locations. Hazardous driving
conditions are possible, especially for high profile vehicles
on bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages are possible.
Elsewhere across southeast North Carolina and northeast South
Carolina, little to no impact is anticipated.
