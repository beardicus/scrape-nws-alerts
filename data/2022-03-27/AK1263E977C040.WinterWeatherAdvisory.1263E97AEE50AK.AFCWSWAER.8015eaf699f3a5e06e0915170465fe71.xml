<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued March 27 at 4:16PM AKDT until March 28 at 1:00PM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM THIS
EVENING TO 1 PM AKDT MONDAY FOR TURNAGAIN PASS AND THE PORTAGE
VALLEY...
* WHAT...Snow and blowing snow expected. Visibility as low as one
half mile at times in blowing snow. Total snow accumulations of
6 to 15 inches are possible with highest snow accumulations
through Turnagain Pass. Winds gusting as high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...Turnagain Pass and the Portage Valley.
* WHEN...From 7 PM this evening to 1 PM AKDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Winds will cause areas of blowing snow, significantly
reducing visibilities. Plan on slippery road conditions. The
hazardous conditions will impact the Monday morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A strengthening frontal system will impact
Turnagain Pass and the Portage Valley. Snow and blowing snow are
expected due to cooler temperatures tonight, especially for
Turnagain Pass. Portage Valley will hover just below freezing
tonight with occasional periods of blowing snow. However, as
temperatures slowly warm Monday morning expect blowing snow
conditions to diminish across Portage Valley. Turnagain Pass is
expected to stay cold enough to support blowing snow conditions
through 1 PM Monday. Temperatures will then warm to near
freezing Monday afternoon, which will end the threat of blowing
snow. Though visibilities will improve, snow and elevated winds
will continue across the region through Tuesday morning.</description>
