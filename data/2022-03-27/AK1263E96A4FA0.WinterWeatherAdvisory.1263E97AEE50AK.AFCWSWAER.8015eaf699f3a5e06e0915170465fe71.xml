<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued March 27 at 4:08AM AKDT until March 28 at 1:00PM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM THIS
EVENING TO 1 PM AKDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Blowing snow and snow expected. Visibility as low as one
half mile at times in blowing snow. Total snow accumulations of
6 to 12 inches are possible, especially in the Portage Valley.
Winds gusting as high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...Turnagain Pass and the Portage Valley.
* WHEN...From 7 PM this evening to 1 PM AKDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Winds will cause areas of blowing snow, significantly
reducing visibilities. Plan on slippery road conditions. The
hazardous conditions could impact the Monday morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A strengthening frontal system will impact
Turnagain Pass and the Portage Valley. Snow and blowing snow are
initially expected due to cooler temperatures Sunday evening and
Sunday night. However as slightly warmer air moves into the
Portage Valley blowing snow will end by Monday morning with snow
changing over to a rain-snow mix by the afternoon. Turnagain
Pass is expected to stay cold enough for blowing snow conditions
to persist through 1 PM Monday. Temperatures will then warm to
near freezing Monday afternoon, which will end the threat of
blowing snow. Though visibilities will improve, snow and
elevated winds will continue across the region through Tuesday.</description>
