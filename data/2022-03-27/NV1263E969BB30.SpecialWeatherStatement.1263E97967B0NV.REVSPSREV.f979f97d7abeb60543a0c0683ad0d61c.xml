<headline>Special Weather Statement issued March 27 at 1:28AM PDT  by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...Breezy today, then much cooler with rain and snow showers
tonight into Monday...
* Southerly winds will be on the increase today ahead of an
incoming storm. Most gusts will be in the 30-40 mph range for
valley locations with potential travel difficulties for high
profile vehicles and choppy lake conditions. Sierra ridges may
gust above 80 mph this afternoon through Monday morning, which
could cause impacts for ski operations and backcountry
recreation, in addition to rough air for aviators.
* Valley rain and mountain snow will reach the Sierra late Sunday
night into Monday morning, spreading into western Nevada Monday
morning. Be prepared for delays and wet or snow covered mountain
passes if you need to travel over the Sierra Monday. Rain and
snow will diminish Monday night.
* Liquid totals (0.50 to 1 inch) will be highest along the Sierra
crest from Tahoe south through Mono County, with light amounts
for communities (0.25 inch or less) in the eastern Sierra and
western Nevada south of Interstate 80. Locally higher totals
are possible due to the showery nature of the precipitation.
There is a 10-20% chance of thunderstorms Monday which may
impact outdoor recreation.
* Snow levels will remain near and above 6000 feet, with snow
accumulations mainly limited to passes above 7000 feet due to
the recent warmth and late-March sun angle. The only exception
will be early Monday morning, where light, slushy accumulations
may occur as low as 6000 feet. The high Sierra could pick up 5
to 10 inches of snow, with locally higher amounts in Alpine and
Mono Counties.
* While nothing out of the ordinary, it will be significantly
cooler Monday compared to the recent warmth and highs may
struggle to reach 60 degrees in the warmest of valleys.</description>
