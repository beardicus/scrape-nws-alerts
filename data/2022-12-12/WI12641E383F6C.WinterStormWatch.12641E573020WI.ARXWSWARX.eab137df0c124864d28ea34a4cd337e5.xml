<description>...Winter Storm Impacts the Area Midweek..
.A strong winter storm affects northern Wisconsin between Tuesday
evening and Thursday. A wintry mix of freezing rain and snow
arrives Tuesday night. By Wednesday morning, two to three tenths
of ice may coat roadways, trees, and power lines. Travel will
likely be hazardous. This ice, coupled with strong winds gusting
to 35 to 45 mph, may result in localized tree damage and power
outages. Snow sets in by Wednesday morning with a prolonged light
to moderate snowfall through Thursday.
This forecast is very sensitive to temperatures, which will be
right near freezing. If temperatures warm a few degrees above
freezing, icing will be reduced. Stay tuned to updates on this
potentially hazardous weather.
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY EVENING
THROUGH WEDNESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation possible. Total snow
accumulations of 3 to 5 inches and ice accumulations of around
two to three tenths of an inch possible. Winds could gust as
high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Taylor and Clark Counties.
* WHEN...The main freezing rain threat will be Tuesday evening
into early Wednesday morning, followed by snow the rest of the
day and Wednesday night.
* IMPACTS...Power outages and tree damage are likely due to the
ice. Travel could be nearly impossible. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute.</description>
