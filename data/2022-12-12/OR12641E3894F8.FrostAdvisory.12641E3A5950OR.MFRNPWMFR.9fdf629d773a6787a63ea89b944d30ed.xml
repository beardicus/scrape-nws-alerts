<description>...FROST ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 2 AM TO 9 AM PST TUESDAY...
...AIR STAGNATION ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM WEDNESDAY
TO 4 AM PST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the frost advisory, temperatures as low as 33 will
result in frost formation. For the Air Stagnation Advisory,
stagnant air is expected, which may lead to deteriorating air
quality expected.
* WHERE...South Central Oregon Coast and Curry County Coast.
* WHEN...For the Frost Advisory, from 2 AM to 9 AM PST Tuesday.
For the Air Stagnation Advisory, from 4 AM Wednesday to 4 AM
PST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Frost could kill sensitive outdoor vegetation if

diminishing air quality with time, especially in and near
areas with significant sources of air pollution. Diminished
air quality is likely to cause health issues for people with
respiratory problems if precautions are not taken.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Temperatures Tuesday night into wednesday
morning are also likely to drop to near freezing.

<instruction>Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold.
People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with diminished air quality. N95 masks are
effective at filtering out the majority of harmful air
particulates.
State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor
burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be
limited as much as possible. According to state air quality
agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants
close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with
your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
