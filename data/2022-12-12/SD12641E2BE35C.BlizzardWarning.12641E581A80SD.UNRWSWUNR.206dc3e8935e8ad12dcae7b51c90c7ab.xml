<headline>Blizzard Warning issued December 12 at 3:23PM MST until December 15 at 5:00AM MST by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>...POTENT WINTER STORM EARLY TUESDAY THROUGH MIDWEEK...
.A strong winter storm will impact the region late tonight
through Wednesday night, with heavy snow, wind, and mixed
precipitation for much of northeast Wyoming and western South
Dakota. Six inches or more of snow is expected in most areas,
with a good portion of far northeast Wyoming and the western
South Dakota plains having high potential for over a foot of
snow. Favored areas of the northern Black Hills could receive
over 2 feet of snow. In addition, strong northwest winds gusting
40 to over 50 mph at times on the plains, will support blizzard
conditions at times. Further east toward south central South
Dakota, there will be the potential for freezing rain with icing
possible. Some uncertainty still remains at this time with respect
to the exact track, duration, and intensity of the storm, which
will impact snow amounts and winds. This is especially the case
for the central and southern Black Hills area (including Rapid
City, Custer, Newcastle, and Hermosa), where downslope drying
could highly affect snow amounts. Listen to NOAA Weather Radio or
your local media for the latest updates on this storm.
