<headline>Blizzard Warning issued December 12 at 4:34AM MST until December 15 at 5:00AM MST by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>...POTENT WINTER STORM EARLY TUESDAY THROUGH MIDWEEK...
.A strong winter storm will impact the region late tonight
through Wednesday night, with heavy snow, wind, and mixed
precipitation for much of northeast Wyoming and western South
Dakota. Six inches or more of snow is expected in most areas,
with a good portion of far northeast Wyoming and the western
South Dakota plains having high potential for over a foot of
snow. Favored areas of the northern Black Hills could receive
over 2 feet of snow. In addition, strong northwest winds gusting
40 to over 50 mph at times on the plains, will support blizzard
conditions at times. Further east toward south central South
Dakota, there will be the potential for freezing rain and sleet
with icing possible. Some uncertainty still remains at this time
with respect to the track, duration, and intensity of the storm,
which will impact snow amounts and winds. This is especially the
case for the central and southern Black Hills area (including
Rapid City, Custer, Newcastle, and Hermosa), where downslope
drying could highly affect snow amounts. Listen to NOAA Weather
Radio or your local media for the latest updates on this storm.
...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT TONIGHT TO
5 AM MST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions expected. Total snow accumulations of
8 to 20 inches, highest amounts generally over far eastern Meade
and Pennington counties. Winds gusting as high as 55 mph.
* WHERE...The Custer County Plains, the Pennington County
Plains, the Sturgis/Piedmont Foot Hills and the Southern Meade
County Plains.
* WHEN...From midnight tonight to 5 AM MST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible.

Gusty winds could bring down tree branches.</description>
<instruction>A Blizzard Warning means the combination of snow, blowing snow,
and strong winds will create dangerous whiteout conditions.
