<description>...PLAINS BLIZZARD DEVELOPING BY TUESDAY MORNING...
.A strong winter storm system will produce blizzard conditions over
northeastern Colorado late tonight through Tuesday. Strong winds are
expected to gust up to 60 mph. The heaviest snow is expected to be
on the plains east of Greeley and Denver, focusing toward the Akron,
Sterling, and possibly Fort Morgan areas.
If you are planning travel north or east of Denver Tuesday, you
should consider changing your plans to avoid travel during the day
on Thursday. Travel will be difficult to impossible and road
closures are likely. Those with outdoor livestock interests should
prepare now for likely blizzard conditions on Tuesday and continued
cold and windy weather behind the storm Wednesday and Thursday.
