<description>...PLAINS BLIZZARD DEVELOPING BY TUESDAY MORNING...
.A strong winter storm system will produce blizzard conditions over
northeastern Colorado late tonight through Tuesday. Strong winds are
expected to gust up to 60 mph. The heaviest snow is expected to be
on the plains east of Greeley and Denver, focusing toward the Akron,
Sterling, and possibly Fort Morgan areas.
If you are planning travel north or east of Denver Tuesday, you
should consider changing your plans to avoid travel. Travel will be
difficult to impossible and road closures are likely. Those with
outdoor livestock interests should prepare now for likely blizzard
conditions on Tuesday.  Continued cold and windy weather will
continue behind the storm Wednesday and Thursday.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 PM MST
TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 2 and 6
inches. Winds gusting as high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...Fort Collins, Denver, Castle Rock, and Greeley.
* WHEN...Until 3 PM MST Tuesday.

blowing snow will reduce visibility to a quarter mile or less.

impact the Tuesday morning commute.</description>

conditions for Colorado can be obtained by calling 5 1 1 or by going
