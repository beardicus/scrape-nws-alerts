<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued December 12 at 3:23PM MST until December 15 at 5:00AM MST by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>...POTENT WINTER STORM EARLY TUESDAY THROUGH MIDWEEK...
.A strong winter storm will impact the region late tonight
through Wednesday night, with heavy snow, wind, and mixed
precipitation for much of northeast Wyoming and western South
Dakota. Six inches or more of snow is expected in most areas,
with a good portion of far northeast Wyoming and the western
South Dakota plains having high potential for over a foot of
snow. Favored areas of the northern Black Hills could receive
over 2 feet of snow. In addition, strong northwest winds gusting
40 to over 50 mph at times on the plains, will support blizzard
conditions at times. Further east toward south central South
Dakota, there will be the potential for freezing rain with icing
possible. Some uncertainty still remains at this time with respect
to the exact track, duration, and intensity of the storm, which
will impact snow amounts and winds. This is especially the case
for the central and southern Black Hills area (including Rapid
City, Custer, Newcastle, and Hermosa), where downslope drying
could highly affect snow amounts. Listen to NOAA Weather Radio or
your local media for the latest updates on this storm.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 2 AM TUESDAY TO
5 AM MST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 4 to
10 inches. Winds gusting as high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...In South Dakota, the Rapid City area, the Central
Black Hills, the Southern Black Hills and the Hermosa Foot
Hills. In Wyoming, the Weston County Plains.
* WHEN...From 2 AM Tuesday to 5 AM MST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. Gusty winds could
bring down tree branches. The cold wind chills as low as 20
below zero could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little
as 30 minutes.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Warning for snow means severe winter weather
conditions are expected. This will create dangerous conditions.
Road conditions are available on your smartphone from the
5 1 1 app for your state.</instruction>
