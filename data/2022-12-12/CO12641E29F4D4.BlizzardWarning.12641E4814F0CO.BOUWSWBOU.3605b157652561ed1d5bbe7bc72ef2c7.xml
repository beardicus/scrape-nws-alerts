<headline>Blizzard Warning issued December 12 at 2:57AM MST until December 14 at 12:00AM MST by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>...POTENT WINTER STORM HEADED FOR THE REGION...
.A strong winter storm system will track toward southeast Colorado
tonight, and then lift northeast into Nebraska by Tuesday. This
track means that significant winter travel impacts can be expected
especially over portions of the northeast plains of Colorado into
the Nebraska Panhandle and parts of eastern Wyoming. Blizzard
conditions will likely develop over northeastern Colorado as the
storm intensifies late tonight and Tuesday morning. Strong winds are
expected to gust to 50-60 mph, creating blizzard conditions.  There
is still some uncertainty about snow amounts, but the heaviest snow
should be on the plains east of Greeley and Denver, focusing toward
the Akron, Sterling, and possibly Fort Morgan areas.
People planning travel north or east of Denver Tuesday, or those
with outdoor livestock interests should prepare for likely blizzard
conditions on Tuesday and continued cold and windy weather behind
the storm Wednesday and Thursday.
...BLIZZARD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT TONIGHT TO MIDNIGHT MST
TUESDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions expected. Total snow accumulations
between 3 and 6 inches. Winds gusting as high as 60 mph.
* WHERE...Briggsdale and northeast Weld County.
* WHEN...From Midnight tonight to Midnight MST Tuesday Night.
* IMPACTS...Visibility will be near zero at times resulting in
whiteout conditions. Travel will be treacherous and potentially
life-threatening. Road closures and impassable roads are likely.
Strong winds will cause extensive drifting snow and may cause
minor damage and power outages. Strong winds will continue to
cause drifting snow in northeastern Colorado on Wednesday and
possibly into Thursday.</description>
<instruction>Prepare for blizzard conditions, road closures, and the possibility
of being stranded if you do travel. Travel only in the event of an
emergency and always take a winter survival kit with you. Include
such items as tire chains, booster cables, flashlight, shovel,
blankets and extra clothing. Also take water, a first aid kit, and
anything else that would help you survive in your car for an
extended time.</instruction>
