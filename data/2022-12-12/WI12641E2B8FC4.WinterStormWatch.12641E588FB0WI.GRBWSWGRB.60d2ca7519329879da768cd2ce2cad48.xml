<description>...WINTER STORM COULD BRING HEAVY SNOW AND HAZARDOUS TRAVEL
MID-WEEK...
.A strong low pressure system will move across the Great Lakes
mid-week, spreading a wintry mix of snow, freezing rain and sleet
across the region Tuesday night into Wednesday. The mixed
precipitation will turn to all snow over much of northern Wisconsin
Wednesday afternoon and evening, with periods of heavy snow expected
Wednesday night. East winds will also gust to 25 to 40 mph, which
could combine with heavy snow accumulations to cause tree and power
line damage. Sporadic power outages will be possible. Travel could
become hazardous due to the snow and ice. Some uncertainty remains
on exact precipitation type and amounts as temperatures will be near
freezing.
...WINTER STORM WATCH NOW IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY MORNING THROUGH
THURSDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Sleet or freezing rain is also
possible, especially Wednesday morning. Total snow accumulations
in excess of 8 inches possible. A light glaze of ice is also
possible. Winds could gust as high as 30 to 40 mph.
* WHERE...Lincoln County.
* WHEN...From Wednesday morning through Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...The strong winds and weight of snow on tree limbs may
down power lines and could cause sporadic power outages. Travel
could be very difficult. The hazardous conditions could impact the
Wednesday morning and evening commutes, and the Thursday morning
commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The heaviest snow is expected to occur
Wednesday night.</description>

necessary, drive with extreme caution. Consider taking a winter
storm kit along with you, including such items as tire chains,
booster cables, flashlight, shovel, blankets and extra clothing.
Also take water, a first aid kit, and anything else that would help
you survive in case you become stranded.</instruction>
