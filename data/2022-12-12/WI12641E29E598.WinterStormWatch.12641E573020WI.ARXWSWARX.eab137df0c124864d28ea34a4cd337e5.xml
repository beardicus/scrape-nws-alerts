<description>...Winter Storm Could Bring Impacts Mid-Week...
.A strong winter storm will affect northern Wisconsin for much of
the week. Precipitation will move in Tuesday night as a wintry
mix and a period of ice accumulation is looking more likely. The
freezing rain and ice should transition to snow Wednesday. Winds
will be gusting in the 35 to 45 mph range, which could cause power
outages if ice does accumulate on power lines. Travel could be
hazardous by Wednesday morning.
This forecast is very sensitive to temperatures, which will be
right near freezing. If temperatures warm a few degrees above
freezing, icing will be reduced. Stay tuned to updates on this
potentially hazardous weather.
...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY EVENING THROUGH
WEDNESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation possible. Total snow
accumulations of 2 to 4 inches and ice accumulations of one
tenth to one quarter of an inch possible. Winds could gust as
high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Taylor and Clark Counties.
* WHEN...From Tuesday evening through Wednesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Power outages and tree damage are possible due to the
ice. Travel could be hazardous. The hazardous conditions could
impact the morning or evening commute.</description>
