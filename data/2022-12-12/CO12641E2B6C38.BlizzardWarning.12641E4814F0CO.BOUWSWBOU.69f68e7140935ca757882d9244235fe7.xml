<headline>Blizzard Warning issued December 12 at 12:18PM MST until December 14 at 12:00AM MST by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>...PLAINS BLIZZARD DEVELOPING BY TUESDAY MORNING...
.A strong winter storm system will produce blizzard conditions over
northeastern Colorado late tonight through Tuesday. Strong winds are
expected to gust up to 60 mph. The heaviest snow is expected to be
on the plains east of Greeley and Denver, focusing toward the Akron,
Sterling, and possibly Fort Morgan areas.
If you are planning travel north or east of Denver Tuesday, you
should consider changing your plans to avoid travel during the day
on Thursday. Travel will be difficult to impossible and road
closures are likely. Those with outdoor livestock interests should
prepare now for likely blizzard conditions on Tuesday and continued
cold and windy weather behind the storm Wednesday and Thursday.
...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT TONIGHT TO
MIDNIGHT MST TUESDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions expected. Total snow accumulations
between 4 and 10 inches. Winds gusting as high as 60 mph.
* WHERE...Briggsdale, Fort Morgan, Byers, Sterling, and Akron.
* WHEN...Blizzard conditions will develop by Tuesday morning and
continue much of the day Tuesday. Conditions will improve late
Tuesday as the snow decreases, but some blowing and drifting snow
will continue into Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Visibility will be near zero at times resulting in white
out conditions. Travel will be treacherous and potentially
life-threatening. Road closures and impassable roads are likely.</description>
<instruction>Prepare for blizzard conditions, road closures, and the possibility
of being stranded if you do travel. Travel only in the event of an
emergency and always take a winter survival kit with you. Include
such items as tire chains, booster cables, flashlight, shovel,
blankets and extra clothing. Also take water, a first aid kit, and
anything else that would help you survive in your car for an
extended time.</instruction>
