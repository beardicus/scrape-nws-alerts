<description>...PLAINS BLIZZARD DEVELOPING BY TUESDAY MORNING...
.A strong winter storm system will produce blizzard conditions over
northeastern Colorado late tonight through Tuesday. Strong winds are
expected to gust up to 60 mph. The heaviest snow is expected to be

difficult to impossible and road closures are likely. Those with
outdoor livestock interests should prepare now for likely blizzard
conditions on Tuesday.  Continued cold and windy weather will
continue behind the storm Wednesday and Thursday.

* WHERE...Rabbit Ears Pass, Rocky Mountain National Park and the
Medicine Bow Range, and The Mountains of Summit County, the
