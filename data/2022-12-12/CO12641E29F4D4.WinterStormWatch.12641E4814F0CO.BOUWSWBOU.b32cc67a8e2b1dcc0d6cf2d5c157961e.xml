<description>...POTENT WINTER STORM HEADED FOR THE REGION...
.A strong winter storm system will track toward southeast Colorado
tonight, and then lift northeast into Nebraska by Tuesday. This
track means that significant winter travel impacts can be expected
especially over portions of the northeast plains of Colorado into
the Nebraska Panhandle and parts of eastern Wyoming. Blizzard
conditions will likely develop over northeastern Colorado as the
storm intensifies late tonight and Tuesday morning. Strong winds are
expected to gust to 50-60 mph, creating blizzard conditions.  There
is still some uncertainty about snow amounts, but the heaviest snow
should be on the plains east of Greeley and Denver, focusing toward
the Akron, Sterling, and possibly Fort Morgan areas.
People planning travel north or east of Denver Tuesday, or those
with outdoor livestock interests should prepare for likely blizzard
conditions on Tuesday and continued cold and windy weather behind
the storm Wednesday and Thursday.
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH
TUESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions possible. Total snow accumulations
between 4 and 7 inches possible. Winds could gust as high as 60
mph.
* WHERE...Julesburg, and Holyoke.
* WHEN...From late tonight through Tuesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Visibility may be near zero at times resulting in
whiteout conditions. Travel may be treacherous and potentially
life-threatening. Road closures and impassable roads are likely.
Strong winds will cause extensive drifting snow and may cause
minor damage and power outages. Strong winds will continue to
cause drifting snow in northeastern Colorado on Wednesday and
possibly into Thursday.</description>
<instruction>Prepare for possible blizzard conditions, road closures, and the
possibility of being stranded. Continue to monitor the latest
forecasts for updates on this situation.
Consider alternate travel plans rather than traveling north or east
of Denver on Tuesday. If travel is absolutely necessary, be prepared
for road closures or possible stranding. Take a winter storm kit
along with you, including such items as tire chains, booster cables,
flashlight, shovel, blankets and extra clothing. Also take water, a
first aid kit, and anything else that would help you survive in your
car for an extended time.</instruction>
