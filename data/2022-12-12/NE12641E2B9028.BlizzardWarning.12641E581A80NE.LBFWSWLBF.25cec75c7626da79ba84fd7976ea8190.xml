<headline>Blizzard Warning issued December 12 at 2:10PM CST until December 15 at 6:00AM CST by NWS NorthPlatte</headline>
<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM TUESDAY TO 6 AM CST
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow and mixed precipitation expected. Total snow
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches and ice accumulations of up to
two tenths of an inch. Locally higher accumulations possible.
Winds gusting as high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...Keya Paha, Brown, Thomas, McPherson and Keith Counties.
* WHEN...From 6 AM CST /5 AM MST/ Tuesday to 6 AM CST /5 AM MST/
Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be nearly impossible due to very slick,
snow packed roads and low visibility. Blowing snow will
significantly reduce visibility, possibly near whiteout
conditions at times. Strong winds could bring down tree
branches.</description>
<instruction>A Blizzard Warning means severe winter weather conditions are
expected or occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds
and poor visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout
conditions, making travel extremely dangerous. Do not travel. If
you must travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get
stranded, stay with your vehicle.</instruction>
