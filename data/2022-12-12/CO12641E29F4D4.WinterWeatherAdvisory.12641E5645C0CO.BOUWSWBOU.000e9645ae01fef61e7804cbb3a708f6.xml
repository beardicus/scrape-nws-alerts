<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 12 at 2:57AM MST until December 14 at 5:00PM MST by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>...POTENT WINTER STORM HEADED FOR THE REGION...
.A strong winter storm system will track toward southeast Colorado
tonight, and then lift northeast into Nebraska by Tuesday. This
track means that significant winter travel impacts can be expected
especially over portions of the northeast plains of Colorado into
the Nebraska Panhandle and parts of eastern Wyoming. Blizzard
conditions will likely develop over northeastern Colorado as the
storm intensifies late tonight and Tuesday morning. Strong winds are
expected to gust to 50-60 mph, creating blizzard conditions.  There
is still some uncertainty about snow amounts, but the heaviest snow
should be on the plains east of Greeley and Denver, focusing toward
the Akron, Sterling, and possibly Fort Morgan areas.
People planning travel north or east of Denver Tuesday, or those
with outdoor livestock interests should prepare for likely blizzard
conditions on Tuesday and continued cold and windy weather behind
the storm Wednesday and Thursday.
