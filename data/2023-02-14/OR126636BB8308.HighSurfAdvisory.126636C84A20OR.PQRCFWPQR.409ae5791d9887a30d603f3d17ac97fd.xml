<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Large waves and hazardous surf conditions. Breakers 20
to 25 feet.
* WHERE...North Oregon Coast.
* WHEN...Until 10 PM PST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Destructive waves may wash over beaches, jetties,
and other structures unexpectedly. People can be swept off
rocks and jetties and drown while observing high surf. Minor
beach erosion may damage coastal properties and buildings.
Higher than normal water run-up is expected on beaches and low-
lying shoreline.</description>
<instruction>A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches,
producing rip currents, sneaker waves and beach erosion. Stay
well back from the water`s edge and be alert for exceptionally
high waves.
Keep away from large logs on the beach. Water running up on the
beach can easily lift or roll logs which can injure or kill
someone caught in their path.</instruction>
