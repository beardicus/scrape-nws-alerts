<description>...WIND ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM PST EARLY THIS
MORNING...
...HARD FREEZE WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM TO 9 AM PST

* WHERE...Mendocino Coast County.
* WHEN...For the Hard Freeze Warning, from 1 AM to 9 AM PST
Wednesday. For the Wind Advisory, until 4 AM PST early this
morning.
* IMPACTS...Gusty winds could blow around unsecured objects.
Tree limbs could be blown down and a few power outages may
result. Frost and freeze conditions will kill crops, other
sensitive vegetation and possibly damage unprotected outdoor
plumbing.</description>
<instruction>Use extra caution when driving, especially if operating a high
profile vehicle. Secure outdoor objects.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.
Frost Advisories and Freeze Warnings are issued during the local
growing season as defined by climatology and local agriculture
experts. Once the growing season has ended these statements will
no longer be issued until the spring.</instruction>
