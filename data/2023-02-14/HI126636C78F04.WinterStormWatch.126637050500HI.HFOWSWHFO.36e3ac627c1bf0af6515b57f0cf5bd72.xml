<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH FOR BIG ISLAND SUMMITS FROM THURSDAY MORNING
THROUGH SATURDAY AFTERNOON...
.A kona low is expected to bring enhanced moisture over the state
beginning Thursday morning through Saturday afternoon.
Instability in combination with temperatures at the summits near
or below freezing will result in the potential for heavy snow
throughout this period. Additionally, winds gusting up to 70 mph
could produce blizzard-like conditions at times.
...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY MORNING THROUGH
SATURDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations greater
than 6 inches possible. Winds could gust as high as 70 mph.
* WHERE...Big Island Summits.
* WHEN...From Thursday morning through Saturday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Blowing
snow will significantly reduce visibility at times, with periods
of zero visibility.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Watch means there is potential for significant
snow or ice accumulations that may impact the summits. Anyone
planning travel to the summits, including hikers and campers,
should monitor the latest forecasts and consider postponing their
trip until improved weather returns.</instruction>
