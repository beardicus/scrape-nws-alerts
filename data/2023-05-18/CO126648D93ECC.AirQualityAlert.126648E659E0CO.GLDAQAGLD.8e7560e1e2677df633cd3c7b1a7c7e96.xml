<description>...AIR QUALITY HEALTH ADVISORY FOR WILDFIRE SMOKE FROM 1000 AM
THURSDAY UNTIL 800 PM THURSDAY...
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has
issued the following...
WHAT...Air Quality Health Advisory for Wildfire Smoke.
WHERE...Sedgwick, Logan, Phillips, Weld, Morgan, Yuma and
Washington Counties. Locations include, but are not limited to
Julesburg, Sterling, Holyoke, Fort Morgan, Wray and Akron.
WHEN...1000 AM Thursday May 18 to 800 PM Thursday May 18
IMPACTS...Several large wildfires are burning in Canada, resulting
in heavy smoke across several states. Northwesterly flow has
brought smoke from Canadian wildfires into northeastern Colorado.
Moderate to heavy smoke is possible today throughout northeastern
Colorado. Smoke should decrease Thursday evening as showers and
thunderstorms move through the area.
HEALTH INFORMATION...Public Health Recommendations: If smoke is
thick or becomes thick in your neighborhood you may want to remain
indoors. This is especially true for those with heart disease,
respiratory illnesses, the very young, and the elderly. Consider
limiting outdoor activity when moderate to heavy smoke is present.
Consider relocating temporarily if smoke is present indoors and is
making you ill. If visibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in
your neighborhood, smoke has reached levels that are unhealthy.</description>
