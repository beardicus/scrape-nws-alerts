<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH FRIDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues to be possible.
* WHERE...For the Yukon River, from the mouth of the Nowitna River
to the mouth of the Koyukuk River.
* WHEN...Through Friday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of low lying areas along the Yukon River is now
occurring near the Nowitna River area. Flooding of low lying areas
is expected to move downstream today and tonight. Flooding is
possible at Galena and the village of Koyukuk later today or
tonight. Water could rise rapidly and fish camps and cabins along
the Yukon River from the mouth of the Nowitna River to the mouth
of the Koyukuk River could become flooded. Ruby is not expected to
flood due to its elevation above the river.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- On Wednesday afternoon, an ice jam was in place on the Yukon
River 20 miles upstream of Ruby. There was a 150-mile run of
bank-to-bank ice and high water upstream of this jam.
Flooding was occurring in the Nowitna River area. At Galena,
water is falling, indicating the ice jam is holding water
upstream. When the jam releases, a surge of high water and
ice will move rapidly downriver that could flood Galena and
Koyukuk and low areas in between today or tonight.

- If you live near or along the Yukon River between the Nowitna
and Koyukuk Rivers, stay alert and be prepared to take action. Ice
jam flooding has high uncertainty. Impacts could range between
localized high water and severe flooding. Now is the time to take
precautions. Where possible, move valuables to higher ground and
prepare to move at a moment`s notice.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
