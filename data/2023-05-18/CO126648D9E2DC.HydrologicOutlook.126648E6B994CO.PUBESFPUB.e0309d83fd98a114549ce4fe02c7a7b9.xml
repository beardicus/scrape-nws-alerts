<description>...SPECIAL HYDROLOGIC OUTLOOK...
This outlook is for the Rio Grande Basin in south-central Colorado,
primarily for area rivers and creeks in Mineral, Rio Grande and
Conejos Counties.
This outlook is valid from May 18 to May 23, 2023.
The potential for minor flooding and inundation of low-lying
areas, due to accelerated snowmelt runoff, is higher than
normal in the western Rio Grande Basin.
...OUTLOOK FOR THE NEXT 5 DAYS...
Current snowmelt runoff is expected to accelerate for the remainder
of this week and through the weekend with nighttime temperatures
expected to stay above freezing and with increased rain-on-snow
potential for the higher elevations. Sustained, higher flows can be
expected for the Rio Grande and its tributaries, including the
Conejos and Alamosa Rivers. Bankfull flows in addition to some minor
inundation of low-lying areas is possible along area creeks and
rivers in Mineral, Rio Grande, and Conejos Counties.
Any snowmelt flooding that develops will most likely be minor and
would only result in minimal property damage and minor public threat
or inconvenience.
