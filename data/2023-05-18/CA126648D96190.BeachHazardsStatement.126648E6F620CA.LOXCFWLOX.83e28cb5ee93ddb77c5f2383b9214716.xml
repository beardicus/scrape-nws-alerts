<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued May 18 at 10:00AM PDT until May 18 at 11:00PM PDT by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM PDT THIS
EVENING...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding
during the time of high tide. For the Beach Hazards Statement,
dangerous rip currents and breaking waves of 4 to 6 feet with
max sets to 8 feet due to elevated surf.
* WHERE...Catalina and Santa Barbara Islands, Ventura County
Beaches, Malibu Coast and Los Angeles County Beaches.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 11 PM PDT this
evening. For the Beach Hazards Statement, through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely, around the time of
high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as
parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to
roads or structures is NOT expected. There is an increased
risk of ocean drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers and
surfers out to sea. Waves can wash people off beaches and
rocks, and capsize small boats nearshore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The next high tide of around 6.5 feet is
expected around 9 pm this evening.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to hazardous swimming conditions, or
stay near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly
in such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
