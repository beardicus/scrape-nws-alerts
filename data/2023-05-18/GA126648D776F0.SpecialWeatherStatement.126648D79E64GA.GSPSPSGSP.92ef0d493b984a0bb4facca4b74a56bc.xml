<description>...HEAVY RAIN PRODUCING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL IMPACT ELBERT
AND HART COUNTIES UNTIL 145 AM EDT...
At 1239 AM EDT, Doppler radar indicated a series of heavy rain
producing showers and thunderstorms moving slowly northwest across
Elbert and Hart Counties. These showers were producing rainfall at
rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour and this heavy rain is likely to
continue at times through the early morning hours, with some slow
drift in the heavy rainfall areas. Area streams and creeks will
rapidly rise to near bankfull in some locations, and low-lying and
poor drainage areas could see deep standing water develop.
Locations to be impacted include...Elberton, Hartwell, Bowman,
Bowersville, Bobby Brown State Park, Russell State Park, Nancy Hart
State Park, Middleton, Lake Storm Thurmond and Royston.
Flooding is most likely along and near Little Beaverdam Creek and
associated tributaries near the Hart and Elbert County border.</description>
<instruction>Torrential rainfall may flood areas with poor drainage, such as
ditches and underpasses. Avoid these areas and do not cross flooded
roads. Water levels of small streams may also rise rapidly. Seek
higher ground if threatened by flood waters.</instruction>
