<description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in
Minnesota...

Counties.
Minnesota River at Savage affecting Scott, Carver, Hennepin and
Dakota Counties.

.Recent heavy rainfall has resulted in flooding along the Minnesota
River and many of its tributaries, especially from the Cottonwood
River downstream to the Mississippi River. This has caused area
rivers to rapidly rise. Crests should occur within the next few days
before a dry pattern this coming week allows for rivers to decrease
again.

forecast.
* WHERE...Minnesota River near Jordan.
* WHEN...Until Wednesday evening.
* IMPACTS...At 29.5 feet, Highway 41 at Chaska may close when the

- At 945 AM CDT Thursday, the stage was 28.9 feet.
- Recent Activity...The maximum river stage in the 24 hours
ending at 945 AM CDT Thursday was 28.9 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise to a crest of 30.0
feet early Saturday morning. It will then fall below flood
stage early Wednesday morning.
