<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued May 18 at 6:17PM PDT until May 18 at 8:15PM PDT by NWS Spokane</headline>
<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING FOR THE IRVING PEAK BURN SCAR REMAINS IN
EFFECT UNTIL 815 PM PDT THIS EVENING FOR WEST CENTRAL CHELAN
COUNTY...
At 617 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing heavy
rain over the Irving Peak Burn Scar. Between 1 and 1.5 inches of
rain have fallen. Additional rainfall amounts of 0.5 to 1 inch are
possible in the warned area. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected
to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through the Little Wenatchee River Drainage. The debris flow
can consist of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding caused by thunderstorms
in and around the Irving Peak Burn Scar.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Life threatening flash flooding of areas in and around
the Irving Peak Burn Scar.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Riverside Campground and Lake Creek Campground.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>The affected areas are in and below the Irving Peak burn scar
northwest of Lake Wenatchee, including the steep slopes of along
White River and Little Wenatchee River. High intensity rainfall on
the burned area may cause flash flooding, mud slides and rock
slides. Hikers, campers, and motorists in and below the Irving Peak
burned area should take immediate precautions to protect life and
property.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
