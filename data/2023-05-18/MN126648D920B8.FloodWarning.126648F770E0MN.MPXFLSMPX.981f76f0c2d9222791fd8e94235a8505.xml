<description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in
Minnesota...

Counties.
Minnesota River at Savage affecting Scott, Carver, Hennepin and
Dakota Counties.

.Recent heavy rainfall has resulted in flooding along the Minnesota
River and many of its tributaries, especially from the Cottonwood
River downstream to the Mississippi River. This has caused area
rivers to rapidly rise. Crests should occur within the next few days
before a dry pattern this coming week allows for rivers to decrease
again.
