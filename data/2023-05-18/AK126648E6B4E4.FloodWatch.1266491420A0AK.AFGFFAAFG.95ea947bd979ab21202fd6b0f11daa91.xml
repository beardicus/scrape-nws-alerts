<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues to be possible.
* WHERE...For the Yukon River, from the mouth of the Nowitna River
to Koyukuk, including Galena
* WHEN...Through Noon Saturday
* IMPACTS...Flooding of low lying areas along the Yukon River is now
occurring near the Nowitna River area. Flooding of low lying areas
is expected to move downstream Friday through Saturday. Flooding
is possible at Galena and Koyukuk. Water could rise rapidly and
fish camps and cabins along the Yukon River from the mouth of the
Nowitna River to the Koyukuk could become flooded. Ruby is not
expected to flood due to its elevation above the river.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- On Thursday afternoon, an ice jam remains in place on the
Yukon River 20 miles upstream of Ruby. Ice has stopped moving
from 50 miles upriver of the jam. Extensive overbank flooding
is occuring near the ice jam. At Galena, water is falling,
indicating the ice jam is holding water upstream. When the
jam releases, a surge of high water and ice will move rapidly
downriver that could flood Galena and
Koyukuk and low areas Friday through Saturday.

and Koyukuk Rivers stay alert and be prepared to take action.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
