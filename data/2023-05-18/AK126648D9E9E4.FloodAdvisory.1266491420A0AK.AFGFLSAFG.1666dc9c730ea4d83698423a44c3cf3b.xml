<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY FOR AN ICE JAM IN EFFECT UNTIL 1215 PM AKDT
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam is occurring.
* WHERE...Yukon River between Tanana and the Nowitna River.
* WHEN...Until 1215 PM AKDT Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas
along the Yukon River between Tanana and Nowitna River. Flooding
could be worse near the Nowitna River.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1214 PM AKDT, The River Watch Team reports an ice jam on
the Yukon River that extends from Horner Hot Springs upriver
to the the Boneyard. This 50 mile long ice jam is backing
water up as far as the village of Tanana, which is 40 miles
miles upstream of the Boneyard. This jam is likely backing
water up the Nowitna River, and other rivers and creeks that
drain into the Yukon between Tanana and the Nowitna River. At
the village of Tanana, water is now moving into low spots
causing minor flooding. At Tanana, water is expected to rise
very slowly over the next day or two with minor flooding of
low spots to continue.  Areas closer to the ice jam such as
the Nowitna River could see higher flood levels.
- Minor flooding in Tanana is expected to continue into the
weekend. Water levels may rise very slowly over the next day
at Tanana, but flooding is expected to remain in low lying
areas. Flooding along the Yukon River downstream closer to
the Nowitna River will likely be worse.  Flooding on the
Nowitna River may occur as well.
- For Tanana: At 9:00am the stage was 84.96 feet.
Flood Stage is 86.0 feet.

be prepared to take action.</description>
