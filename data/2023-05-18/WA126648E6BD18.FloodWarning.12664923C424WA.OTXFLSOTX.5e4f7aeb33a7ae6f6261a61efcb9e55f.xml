<instruction>Cold and swift flowing rivers can be life threatening this time of
year. The combination of cold water shock and fast current increases
the danger of drowning in our rivers. Keep an eye on children if
they are playing near rivers and put a life jacket on them.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
The next statement will be issued Friday afternoon at 400 PM PDT.</instruction>
