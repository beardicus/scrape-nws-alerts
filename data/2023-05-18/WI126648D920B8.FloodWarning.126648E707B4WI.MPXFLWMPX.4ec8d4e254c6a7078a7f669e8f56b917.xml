<headline>Flood Warning issued May 18 at 10:34AM CDT until further notice by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in the Twin Cities has issued a
Flood Warning for the following rivers in Minnesota and Wisconsin...
Mississippi River at St. Paul affecting Washington, Ramsey and
Dakota Counties.
Mississippi River near Hastings L/D 2 (COE) affecting Pierce,
Washington, Goodhue and Dakota Counties.
.Recent heavy rainfall has resulted in flooding along the Minnesota
River and many of its tributaries, especially from the Cottonwood
River downstream to the Mississippi River. This has caused area
rivers to rapidly rise. Crests should occur within the next few days
before a dry pattern this coming week allows for rivers to decrease
again.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY AFTERNOON UNTIL FURTHER
NOTICE...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Mississippi River near Hastings L/D 2 (COE).
* WHEN...From Friday afternoon until further notice.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 930 AM CDT Thursday, the stage was 13.4 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above flood stage
tomorrow afternoon and continue rising to a crest of 16.6
feet early Monday morning.
- Flood stage is 15.0 feet.
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
16.6 feet on 06/30/1957.
