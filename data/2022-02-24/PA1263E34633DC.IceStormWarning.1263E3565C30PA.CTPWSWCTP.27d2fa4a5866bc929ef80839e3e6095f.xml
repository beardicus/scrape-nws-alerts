<headline>Ice Storm Warning issued February 24 at 4:11AM EST until February 25 at 10:00AM EST by NWS State College</headline>
<description>...ICE STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 5 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO 10 AM
EST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Significant icing expected. Total snow accumulations of
up to two inches and ice accumulations of two tenths to four
tenths of an inch.
* WHERE...Clearfield and Blair Counties.
* WHEN...From 5 PM today until 10 AM EST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Power outages and tree damage are likely due to the
ice. Travel disruptions are expected to be significant overnight
and into early Friday morning. The hazardous conditions will
impact the Friday morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Mixed precipitation will quickly become all
freezing rain late this evening. The temperatures will start to
warm above freezing around daybreak Friday. Gusty west winds on
Friday may lead to power outages as the icy trees could fall
onto power lines. The heavier than normal power lines themselves
will also be subjected to increased stress from the wind.</description>
<instruction>The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and Pennsylvania
Turnpike Commission strongly encourage motorists to heed all
travel restrictions and delay unnecessary travel as severe winter
weather conditions will make travel very hazardous. If you must
travel, keep an extra flashlight, food and water in your vehicle
in case of an emergency.
Call 5 1 1 or visit www.511pa.com for the latest travel, roadway
and traffic conditions.
To report snow or ice, post to the NWS State College Facebook
page, use Twitter @NWSStateCollege, or visit weather.gov/ctp.</instruction>
