<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency. In Illinois, the latest road
conditions can be obtained at www.gettingaroundillinois.com. In
Missouri, the latest road conditions can be obtained at
traveler.modot.org/map or by calling 1-888-275-6636.
Persons should delay all travel if possible. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution and be prepared for sudden
changes in visibility. Leave plenty of room between you and the
motorist ahead of you, and allow extra time to reach your
destination. Avoid sudden braking or acceleration, and be especially
cautious on hills or when making turns. Make sure your car is
winterized and in good working order.
Travel will become dangerous once the freezing rain begins. Travel
is strongly discouraged unless it is an emergency. Avoid any downed
power lines and be ready in case of a loss of power. Untreated roads
and bridges, sidewalks, and parking lots will be treacherous.</instruction>
