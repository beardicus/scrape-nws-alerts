<headline>Ice Storm Warning issued February 24 at 4:11AM EST until February 25 at 10:00AM EST by NWS State College</headline>
<description>...ICE STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 5 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO 10 AM
EST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Significant icing expected. Total snow and sleet
accumulations of up to one inch and ice accumulations of one
quarter to one half of an inch.
* WHERE...Cambria, Somerset and Bedford Counties.
* WHEN...From 5 PM today until 10 AM EST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Power outages and tree damage are likely due to the
ice. Travel could be nearly impossible overnight into early
Friday morning. The hazardous conditions will impact the Friday
morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Mixed precipitation will quickly become all
freezing rain this evening. The temperatures will start to warm
above freezing around daybreak Friday. Gusty west winds on
Friday may lead to power outages as the icy trees could fall
onto power lines. The heavier than normal power lines themselves
will also be subjected to increased stress from the wind.</description>
<instruction>The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and Pennsylvania
Turnpike Commission strongly encourage motorists to heed all
travel restrictions and delay unnecessary travel as severe winter
weather conditions will make travel very hazardous. If you must
travel, keep an extra flashlight, food and water in your vehicle
in case of an emergency.
Call 5 1 1 or visit www.511pa.com for the latest travel, roadway
and traffic conditions.
To report snow or ice, post to the NWS State College Facebook
page, use Twitter @NWSStateCollege, or visit weather.gov/ctp.</instruction>
