<headline>High Wind Watch issued February 24 at 12:19PM AKST until February 26 at 6:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WATCH IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY EVENING THROUGH EARLY SAT
MORNING ALONG THE KUSKOKWIM DELTA COAST...
* WHAT...Southeast winds 40 to 55 mph with gusts up to 70 mph
possible.
* WHERE...Along the Kuskokwim Delta Coast.
* WHEN...From Friday evening through early Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...High winds could move loose debris, damage property,
and cause power outages. Travel could be difficult, especially
for high profile vehicles.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...An unusual wind event is in store for this
time of the year. Strong gusty winds out of the southeast are
expected to develop Friday evening and continue through early
Saturday morning. With the gusty southeasterly winds, this may
cause some sea ice to be pushed up against the shoreline. A low
pressure system is expected to move from southeast to northwest
across the eastern Bering Friday through Friday night. As the
low center passes by to the south, expecting an increase in
southeasterly flow aimed at the Kuskokwim Delta Coast.</description>
<instruction>A high wind watch means there is potential for a hazardous high
wind event. Monitor the latest forecasts and warnings for updates
on this situation. Fasten loose objects or shelter objects in a
safe location prior to the onset of winds.</instruction>
