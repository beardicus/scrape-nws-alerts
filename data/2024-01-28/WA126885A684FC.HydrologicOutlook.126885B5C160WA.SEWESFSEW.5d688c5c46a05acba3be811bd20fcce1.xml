<description>...THREAT OF RIVER FLOODING CONTINUES THROUGH EARLY THIS WEEK FOR
PARTS OF WESTERN WASHINGTON...
Heavy rainfall fell through early this morning as an atmospheric
river moved through the region. Sharp rises have occurred on rivers
and streams with the potential for additional flooding on the less
responsive rivers and streams. Heavy rain has ended this morning,
but another round of rain will be focused early on Monday across the
far northern Olympic Peninsula.
Additional rounds of heavy rainfall are expected this week. The
first on Monday night will again be focused on the Olympic Peninsula
and the North Cascades, but may not lead to additional flood
impacts. A more impactful system may arrive around Tuesday evening,
and could bring enough rain to lead to additional flooding,
especially on rivers running high after this weekend`s previous rain.
This outlook will be updated by 10 AM Monday.
Please monitor the latest river forecasts from the National Weather
Service for additional information.</description>
