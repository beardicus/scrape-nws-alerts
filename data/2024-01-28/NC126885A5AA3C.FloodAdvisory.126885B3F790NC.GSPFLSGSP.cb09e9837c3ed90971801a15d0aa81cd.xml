rainfall continues.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 746 AM EST, Gauge reports indicate a few streams in the
area have risen out of their banks. In particular, North
Second Creek near US 70 is above bankfull stage in the
Woodleaf area, flooding adjacent farmland and other low-lying

be underwater at White Rd, Lyerly Rd, Upright Rd, Graham Rd,
Hall Rd, Childers Rd, and Bear Poplar Rd. Also, Grants Creek
at Rowan Mill Rd near Salisbury has risen out of its banks
and could cause similar impacts on roads in that area. Small
streams elsewhere in western and central Rowan County could
continue to rise for a time today before receding, and some
additional low-water crossings could be impacted.
- Flooding impacts will continue much of today, but no
additional rainfall is expected.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Kannapolis, Salisbury, China Grove, Spencer, Landis,
Enochville, Cleveland, Piedmont Research Station, Woodleaf
and Mount Ulla.
