<instruction>A Flood Warning means water levels above flood stage are imminent or
may already be occurring. Persons along rivers and streams in the
warned area should take immediate precautions to protect life and
property.
River ice is affecting water levels in this area. River forecasts
during ice jams are less certain due to many complicated factors.
Significant river ice cover can cause large water level fluctuations
and flooding with little advanced notice. River ice may also cause
gauge observations to be inaccurate.
Report flooding to the National Weather Service or your local law
enforcement agency only when you can do so safely.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
The next statement will be issued late tonight at 500 AM CST.</instruction>
