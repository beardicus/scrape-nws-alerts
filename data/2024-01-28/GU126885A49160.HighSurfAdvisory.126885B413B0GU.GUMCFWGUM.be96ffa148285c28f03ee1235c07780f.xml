<headline>High Surf Advisory issued January 28 at 3:36PM ChST until January 29 at 5:00PM ChST by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM CHST MONDAY...
...HIGH RISK OF RIP CURRENTS THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 7
to 10 feet in the surf zone. For the High Rip Current Risk,
dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...West and north facing reefs of the Marianas.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 5 PM ChST Monday. For
the High Rip Current Risk, through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...We are on a downward trend on west and
north facing reefs, however, another shearline is anticipated
to move in shortly after the current one leaves. What this means
is the advisories will likely just be carried through the short
down period to the next elevated period. That way there isn`t the
confusion of why products were cancelled to just be restarted.</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
