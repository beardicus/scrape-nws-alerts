<headline>Flood Advisory issued January 28 at 11:43AM EST  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 AM EST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Urban and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall continues.
* WHERE...Central Rowan County and a small portion of northwest
Cabarrus County.
* WHEN...Until 500 AM EST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding is occurring in low-lying and poor
drainage areas along North Second Creek and Grants Creek. River or
stream flows will remain elevated into early Monday.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1135 AM EST, automated gauge reports indicated a few
streams in the area have risen out of their banks. In
particular, North Second Creek near US 70 is flooding low-
lying areas adjacent to N Second Creek, with minor impacts to
vulnerable properties near the creek.  Nearby farmland and
other low-lying areas are inundated with 2 to 4 ft of water.
Water could cover some crossings upstream, possibly including
White Rd, Lyerly Rd, Upright Rd, Graham Rd, Hall Rd, Childers
Rd, and Bear Poplar Rd.  Also, Grants Creek at Rowan Mill Rd
near Salisbury has risen out of its banks and could cause
similar impacts on roads in that area. Small streams
elsewhere in western and central Rowan County could continue
to rise for a time today before receding, and some additional
low-water crossings could be impacted.
- Flooding impacts will continue, but no additional rainfall is
expected. Second Creek is not expected to rise to a level
that will cause property impacts but it is important to stay
vigilant for slight rises beyond what has already occurred.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Kannapolis, Salisbury, China Grove, Spencer, Landis,
Enochville, Cleveland, Piedmont Research Station, Woodleaf
and Mount Ulla.
