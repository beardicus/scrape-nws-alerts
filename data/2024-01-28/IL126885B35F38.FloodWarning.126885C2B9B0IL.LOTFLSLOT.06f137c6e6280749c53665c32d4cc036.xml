<instruction>Heavy river ice is affecting water levels in this area. River
forecasts during ice jams are less certain due to many complicated
factors. Significant river ice cover can cause large water level
fluctuations and flooding with little advanced notice. River ice may
also cause gauge observations to be inaccurate.
A Flood Warning means water levels above flood stage are imminent or
may already be occurring. Persons along rivers and streams in the
warned area should take immediate precautions to protect life and
property.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
The next statement will be issued byMonday afternoon at 1215 PM CST.</instruction>
