<description>...HEAVY RAIN THROUGH SATURDAY WILL CREATE RISING RIVERS AND STREAMS
WITH A CHANCE OF DEBRIS FLOWS FROM RECENT WILDFIRE BURN SCARS...
An Atmospheric River will produce moderate to heavy precipitation
across portions of northeast Oregon and southeast Washington through
early Saturday morning. Snow is gradually transitioning to rain in
the northern Blue Mountains.  Steady moderate to heavy rain today
and tonight will keep the ground saturated.
Total liquid precipitation amounts through 11pm PDT tonight ranging
from 0.5 to 1.25 inches are expected along the foothills.  Total
amounts ranging from 1.50 to 3.5 inches are expected in the
mountains with locally heavy amounts nearing 4 inches.
This will lead to rises on area rivers and streams, with nuisance to
minor flooding possible, especially along Mill Creek in Umatilla and
Walla Walla counties. Debris flows from the recent fires such as
Elbow Creek and Green Ridge Fires are possible in the steep terrain.
Ponding of water in low-lying areas and in areas of poor drainage
can be expected.
Please monitor the latest river forecasts from the National Weather
Service for additional information.</description>
