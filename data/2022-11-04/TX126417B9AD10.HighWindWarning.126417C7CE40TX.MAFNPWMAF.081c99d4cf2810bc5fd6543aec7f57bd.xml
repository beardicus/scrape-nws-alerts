<headline>High Wind Warning issued November 04 at 2:40AM CDT until November 04 at 7:00PM CDT by NWS Midland-Odessa</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM CDT THIS EVENING...
...FREEZE WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...For the High Wind Warning, west winds 30 to 40 mph with
gusts up to 60 mph. For the Freeze Watch, sub-freezing
temperatures as low as 29 possible.
* WHERE...Davis Mountains.
* WHEN...For the High Wind Warning, until 7 PM CDT this evening.
For the Freeze Watch, from late tonight through Saturday
morning.
* IMPACTS...Damaging winds will blow down trees and power lines.
Widespread power outages are expected. Travel will be difficult,
especially for high profile vehicles. Frost and freeze
conditions could kill crops, other sensitive vegetation and
possibly damage unprotected outdoor plumbing.</description>
<instruction>People should avoid being outside in forested areas and around
trees and branches. If possible, remain in the lower levels of
your home during the windstorm, and avoid windows. Use caution if
you must drive.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
