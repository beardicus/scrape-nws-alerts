<instruction>Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.
A Flood Advisory means creeks are running high and may be out of
their banks. Roads in urban or rural areas may have ponding or
flooding in low areas.</instruction>
