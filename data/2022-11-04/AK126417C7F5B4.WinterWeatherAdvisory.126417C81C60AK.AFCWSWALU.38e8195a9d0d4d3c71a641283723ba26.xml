<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued November 04 at 5:01PM AKDT until November 04 at 6:00PM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AKDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Blowing snow. Total snow accumulations of up to two
inches. Winds gusting as high as 60 mph. Visibility as low as
one half mile.
* WHERE...Port Heiden to Iliamna.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM AKDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Expect difficult travel conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A compact area of low pressure will move
quickly from the Kuskokwim Delta to interior Bristol Bay
today. This system will produce bands of moderate to heavy
snow showers that will move along the Bristol Bay coast and
Alaska Peninsula, mainly in an area from Port Heiden to King
Salmon and Iliamna. Gusty northwesterly winds will accompany
these bands of snow showers, with the gusty winds persisting
through early this evening before winding down. Only minor
accumulations are expected; however, the combination of
snowfall intensity and gusty winds may reduce visibility at
times to as low as one half mile.</description>
