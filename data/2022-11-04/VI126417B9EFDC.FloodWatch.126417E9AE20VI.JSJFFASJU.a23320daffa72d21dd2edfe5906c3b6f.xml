<headline>Flood Watch issued November 04 at 5:11AM AST  by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM AST THIS AFTERNOON
THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands
* WHEN...From 2 PM AST this afternoon through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water crossings may be
flooded. Mudslides and landslides along steep terrains are
possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The combination of a polar trough, along with increasing
moisture will result in favorable atmospheric conditions for
flooding rains. Frequent showers and thunderstorms are likely
from this afternoon into early next week, increasing the
chances for urban, river and flash flooding, along with
mudslides in areas of steep terrain. So far, the areas that
will likely receive the greater amounts of rain are the
eastern and southern half of Puerto Rico, Vieques, Culebra
and the United States Virgin Islands. However, the whole area
will be prone to flooding and mudslides. Expect 3 to 6 inches
of rain, with isolated higher amounts through the watch
period.
