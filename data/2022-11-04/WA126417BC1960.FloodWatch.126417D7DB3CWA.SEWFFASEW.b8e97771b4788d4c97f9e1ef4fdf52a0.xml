<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of northwest Washington and west central
Washington, including the following counties, in northwest
Washington, Clallam, Grays Harbor, Jefferson, Skagit and Whatcom.
In west central Washington, King, Lewis, Pierce, Snohomish and
Thurston.
* WHEN...Through Saturday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Storm drains
and ditches may become clogged with debris. Area creeks and
streams are running high and could flood with more heavy rain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A potent weather system is bringing heavy rainfall to the
region today through early Saturday. Up to 3 to 7 inches of
rainfall has already fallen in the mountains. This rainfall
will result in rapid rises and potential for flooding along
area rivers. Some river flood warnings have already been
issued, and additional flooding is possible.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
