<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH FRIDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Moderate to high risk of sneaker waves expected. These
are waves that run unusually higher up on beaches when compared
to other observed waves.
* WHERE...Beaches along the Southern Oregon Coast, including the
beaches of Douglas, Coos, and Curry counties.
* WHEN...From Thursday afternoon through Friday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Even during calm conditions, sneaker waves can sweep
up the beach without warning and knock unsuspecting people over
and pull them out to sea. Shock and hypothermia can occur
quickly in the cold Pacific waters. In addition, logs and other
debris can be lifted and carried by the waves, crushing or
entrapping unsuspecting victims underneath.
