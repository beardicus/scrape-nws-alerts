lines. Widespread power outages are possible. Travel could be

https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/map/?wfo=mfr</description>
<instruction>* Slow down and allow for plenty of room between you and other
vehicles.
* Fog makes objects appear farther away than they are
* Use low beams. High beams reflect back thick fog, making
visibility worse for you and other drivers.
* Be prepared. Keep your headlights clean. That way, you`re
ready for low-visibility conditions
* Don`t use cruise control. Most crashes occur because the
driver is going too fast for weather conditions.</instruction>
