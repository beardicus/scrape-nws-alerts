<senderName>NWS Monterey (The San Francisco area)</senderName>
<headline>Flood Watch issued January 29 at 12:41PM PST until January 31 at 1:00PM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>.Model guidance continues to suggests greatest accumulation of
precipitation will be observed across the North Bay and along
the coastal ranges. Rainfall totals remain consistent with
1.5 to 3 inches expected across most areas with 3-5 inches
expected over the North Bay. Locally up to 6 to 8 inches over
favored peaks and higher terrain of the the North Bay and up to
4 to 6 inches in the Santa Cruz and Santa Lucia Mountains.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH LATE
THURSDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...Entire San Francisco Bay Area and Central Coast including
Monterey and San Benito Counties.
* WHEN...From late Tuesday night through late Thursday night.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water
crossings may be flooded. Storm drains and ditches may become
clogged with debris.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Periods of moderate to heavy rainfall will bring the
potential for moderate to rapid rises along area rivers,
streams, and creeks across the region. This could result in
nuisance as well as minor flooding. Although many sites are
forecast to remain below flood stage, several locations may
reach and exceed flood stage across the region.
Ensemble guidance shows a greater than 50 percent chance of
reaching flood stage on numerous rivers and creeks across the
North Bay  and monitor stage on the San Lorenzo River at Big
Trees and numerous other locations across the San Francisco
and Monterey Bay Area by Thursday.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
