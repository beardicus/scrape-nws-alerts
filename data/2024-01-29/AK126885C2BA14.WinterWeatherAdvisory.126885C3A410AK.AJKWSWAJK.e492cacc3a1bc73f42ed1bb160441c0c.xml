<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 29 at 6:01PM AKST until January 30 at 12:00AM AKST by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...POSSIBLE SNOW FOR THE NORTHERN PANHANDLE...
.Confidence has increased on an overrunning event which will
bring warning level snow to the northern panhandle. Cold, dry,
northerly winds will undercut warm moist air, resulting in snow
accumulation for Skagway, Haines, and surrounding area. What is
uncertain is how strong the northerly winds will push the band of
snow southward. For Yakutat, convective snow showers will cause
fast accumulating snow for a short time.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT AKST
TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 3 to 5
inches.
* WHERE...City and Borough of Yakutat.
* WHEN...Until midnight AKST tonight.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow will begin as wet and heavy before
transitioning to drier, light snow. Convective snow showers will
cause reduced visibilities down to 1/2 mile.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
People are urged to prepare their property before the onset of
winter weather.
For the latest road conditions, where available, call 5 1 1 or
