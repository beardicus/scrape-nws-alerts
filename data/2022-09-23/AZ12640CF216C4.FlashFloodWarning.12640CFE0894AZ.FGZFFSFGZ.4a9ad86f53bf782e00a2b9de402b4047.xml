<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING FOR THE SLATE CREEK BASIN REMAINS IN EFFECT
UNTIL 545 PM MST THIS AFTERNOON FOR GILA COUNTY...
At 315 PM MST, Doppler radar indicated strong thunderstorms
producing heavy rain over the Slate Creek basin. Between 1.5 and 3
inches of rain have fallen. Additional rainfall amounts up to 1 inch
are possible in the warned area. Flash flooding is ongoing or
expected to begin shortly.
HAZARD...Life-threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms producing
flash flooding in and around the Slate Creek basin.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Life threatening flash flooding of areas in and around
the Slate Creek basin.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
mainly rural areas of Gila County
This includes the following highways...
State Route 188 between mile markers 268 and 269.
State Route 87 near mile marker 230.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>Get to higher ground immediately! Raging flash flood waters and
debris will inundate residences near State Route 188 along the banks
of Slate Creek.
Turn Around, Don`t Drown! National Forest Service Road 26 and low
water crossings through Slate Creek will be washed out and
impassable. Flood waters may overtop State Route 188 as culverts
become clogged from flood debris.
In hilly or mountainous terrain, there are many low water crossings
which will become dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross
flooded roads. Find an alternate route.
Report any flooding to local law enforcement and the NWS Flagstaff
when you can do so safely.</instruction>
