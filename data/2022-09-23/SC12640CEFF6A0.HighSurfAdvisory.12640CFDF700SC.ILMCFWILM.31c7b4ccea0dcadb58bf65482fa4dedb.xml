<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS
EVENING...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 4 to
7 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards Statement, Strong
north to south longshore current. For the High Rip Current
Risk, dangerous rip currents expected.
* WHERE...In North Carolina, Coastal Pender and Coastal New

Georgetown Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT this
evening. For the Beach Hazards Statement, through this
evening. For the High Rip Current Risk, through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Longshore currents
can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip currents, piers,
jetties, and other hazardous areas. It may sweep swimmers off
their feet, making it difficult to return to shore.</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.
Caution should be used when in or near the water. Check with
lifeguards before entering the ocean for possible hazards you may
be swept into.</instruction>
