<description>...BLOWING DUST ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM MDT /10 AM CDT/ THIS
MORNING TO 7 PM MDT /8 PM CDT/ THIS EVENING...
...HIGH WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM MDT /10 AM CDT/ THIS
MORNING TO 7 PM MDT /8 PM CDT/ THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Wind Warning, northwest winds 35 to 45 mph
with gusts up to 60 mph expected. For the Blowing Dust
Advisory, visibility between one quarter mile and one mile in
blowing dust expected.
* WHERE...Dundy, Hitchcock and Red Willow Counties.
* WHEN...From 9 AM MDT /10 AM CDT/ this morning to 7 PM MDT /8
PM CDT/ this evening.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous driving conditions due to reduced
visibility. Damaging winds will blow down trees and power
lines. Widespread power outages are expected. Travel will be
difficult, especially for high profile vehicles.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Areas of blowing dust will impact travel.
Widespread visibilities of one mile or less are likely, and
localized visibilities near zero are expected. All travel should
be avoided in this developing potentially dangerous situation.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
People with respiratory problems should make preparations to stay
indoors until the storm passes. Be ready for a sudden drop in
visibility to near zero. If you encounter blowing dust or blowing
sand on the roadway or see it approaching, pull off the road as
far as possible and put your vehicle in park. Turn the lights all
the way off and keep your foot off the brake pedal. Remember,
Pull Aside, Stay Alive.
Secure loose outdoor items. If you are driving, watch for objects
blowing across the roadway and into your path. Keep a safe
distance from cars in adjacent lanes as strong gusts could
suddenly push a vehicle outside its lane of travel. Take extra
care in high-profile vehicles such as a truck, van, or SUV, or
when towing a trailer, as these are more prone to be pushed or
even flipped by high winds.</description>
