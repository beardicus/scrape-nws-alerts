<description>...HEAVY RAINFALL POSSIBLE OVER THE WEEKEND...
Tropical Depression 02W, centered near 4N148E is moving toward
west-northwest. It is expected to turn northwestward, moving toward
Faraulap in eastern Yap State over the next few days. Latest model
guidance is in better agreement over the expected movement and
development of 02W, though the GFS remains most aggressive with the
development of heavy rainfall across the Marianas. The ECMWF now
shows rainfall amounts up to 4 inches for Guam while the GFS shows
amounts in excess of 10 inches through Monday. Heavy rainfall
remains a possibility across the region as 02W strengthens and moves
northwest, with amounts of 5 to 7 inches possible, with locally
heavier amounts.
Localized flooding is possible in low-lying and poor drainage areas,
while flash flooding will be possible in areas of heaviest rainfall,
especially near steep terrain. Residents of the Marianas need to
closely monitor this developing situation as watches, advisories and
warnings could be issued later in the week. If living near streams
and rivers, prepare to move items away from stream and river banks.
Make sure storm drains nearby are not clogged, especially in
low-lying areas.
This outlook will be updated over the next couple of days with
additional information, or cancelled if the situation changes.</description>
