...BLOWING DUST ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM THIS
MORNING TO 8 PM CDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Wind Warning, northwest winds 35 to 45 mph

Advisory, visibility between one quarter mile and one mile in
blowing dust expected.
* WHERE...Decatur, Norton and Graham Counties.
* WHEN...From 10 AM this morning to 8 PM CDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous driving conditions due to reduced

lines. Widespread power outages are expected. Travel will be
difficult, especially for high profile vehicles.

Widespread visibilities of one mile or less are likely, and
localized visibilities near zero are expected. All travel

<instruction>The Kansas Department of Health and Environment recommends that
you take preventative measures during this blowing dust event...
such as staying indoors or wearing protective breathing masks if
outside. High dust concentrations can cause respiratory
problems...decrease lung activity...aggravate asthma...and lead
to potential heart-related problems...especially with children...
elderly...or those with pre-existing respiratory conditions.
People with respiratory problems should make preparations to stay
indoors until the storm passes. Be ready for a sudden drop in
visibility to near zero. If you encounter blowing dust or blowing
sand on the roadway or see it approaching, pull off the road as
far as possible and put your vehicle in park. Turn the lights all
the way off and keep your foot off the brake pedal. Remember,
Pull Aside, Stay Alive.
Secure loose outdoor items. If you are driving, watch for objects
blowing across the roadway and into your path. Keep a safe
distance from cars in adjacent lanes as strong gusts could
suddenly push a vehicle outside its lane of travel. Take extra
care in high-profile vehicles such as a truck, van, or SUV, or
when towing a trailer, as these are more prone to be pushed or
even flipped by high winds.</instruction>
