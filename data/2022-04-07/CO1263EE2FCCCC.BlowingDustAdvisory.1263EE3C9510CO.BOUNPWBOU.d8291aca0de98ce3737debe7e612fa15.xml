<description>...BLOWING DUST ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM MDT THIS EVENING...
...HIGH WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM MDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Northwest winds 30 to 40 mph with gusts to 65 mph. Blowing
dust will reduce visibility below 1 mile at times.
* WHERE...Washington County County.
* WHEN...Until 7 PM MDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous driving conditions due to reduced visibility.
Gusty winds will blow around unsecured objects and a few power
outages may result. Strong winds will likely lead to rapid fire
growth of any new fire. Blowing dust will reduce visibility to
less than a quarter mile in places.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Persons with respiratory problems should make preparations to stay
indoors until the storm passes. Be ready for a sudden drop in
visibility to near zero. If you encounter blowing dust or blowing
sand on the roadway or see it approaching, pull off the road as far
as possible and put your vehicle in park. Turn the lights all the
way off and keep foot off the brake pedal. Remember, &amp;#039;Pull
Aside,
Stay Alive&amp;#039;.
Winds this strong can make driving difficult, especially for high
profile vehicles. Use extra caution.
Avoid outdoor burning or any activity that may cause sparks. The
strong winds will likely fuel rapid fire growth.</description>
