<description>...SOME ACCUMULATING SNOW TODAY, MORE EXPECTED TONIGHT INTO
FRIDAY...
A band of moderate snowfall is expected to set up over the western
portions of Gogebic and Ontonagon counties later today. Wet
snowfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches, locally 4 inches, is expected
in western Gogebic and Ontonagon counties today; less than an
inch is expected over the eastern areas. Therefore, be sure to be
alert and drive cautiously if traveling today in western Gogebic
and Ontonagon counties as roads could be slick and visibilities
could become a half mile or less at times as snowfall rates could
exceed half an inch per hour, particularly during the afternoon
hours.
Tonight into Friday, additional snowfall is expected over the
area, ranging from 4 to 8 inches along the Lake Superior
shoreline with isolated amounts up to around a foot possible in
the Porkies; lesser amounts are expected in the interior areas.</description>
