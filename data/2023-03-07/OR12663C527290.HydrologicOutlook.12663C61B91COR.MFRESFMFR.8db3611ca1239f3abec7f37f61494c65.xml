<description>...Flood Potential Outlook for rain and snow melt flooding on
streams in the following county.
...Curry County in Oregon...
The coming week will be very wet and will be dominated by two
atmospheric river systems that will bring moderate to heavy rain
through the area. The first system will bring 3 to 4 inches of
rain from Thursday through much of Friday. The second system will
roughly double the rain at 5 to 7 inches from Sunday into Tuesday.
The snow level will rise briefly during both atmospheric rivers
which means that there will be rain falling on the low to
mid-elevation snow. This could lead to rapid snow melt causing
small stream flooding and standing water. While the threat of
small stream flooding may be present as both systems pass through
the first system has a lower chance as it may serve more to warm
up the snowpack whereas the second system brings heavier rainfall
and will be a bit warmer and could cause more widespread impacts
from standing water and small stream flooding.
A flood potential outlook is issued when there is the potential
for significant rises or flooding along rivers and streams.
The exact scenario for flooding remains uncertain. This product
will be updated as necessary. Watches and warnings may be issued
by the National Weather Service if this situation worsens.</description>
