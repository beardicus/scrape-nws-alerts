<headline>Air Quality Alert issued July 24 at 4:09PM PDT  by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...AIR QUALITY ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM PDT THURSDAY...
Lane Regional Air Protection Agency has issued an Air Quality
Advisory, which is in effect until 6 AM PDT Thursday morning.
An Air Quality Advisory for smoke has been issued. Wildfires burning
in the region combined with forecasted conditions will cause air
quality to reach unhealthy levels at times through at least Wednesday
night.
Pollutants in smoke can cause burning eyes, runny nose, aggravate
heart and lung diseases, and aggravate other serious health
problems. Limit outdoor activities and keep children indoors if it
is smoky. Please follow medical advice if you have a heart or lung
condition.
Cloth, dust and surgical masks donâ€™t protect from the harmful
particles in smoke. N95 or P100 respirators approved by NIOSH may
offer protection, but they must be properly selected and worn. Select
a NIOSH-approved respirator with a N, R or P alongside the number 95,
99 or 100.
