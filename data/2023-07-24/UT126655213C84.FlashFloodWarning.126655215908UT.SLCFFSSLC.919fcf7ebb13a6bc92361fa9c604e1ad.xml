<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 330 PM MDT THIS
AFTERNOON FOR EAST CENTRAL MILLARD COUNTY...
At 257 PM MDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated
thunderstorms producing heavy rain across the warned area. Between
0.3 and 0.7 inches of rain have fallen. The expected rainfall rate
is 0.1 to 0.25 inches in 1 hour. Additional rainfall amounts up to
0.15 inches are possible in the warned area. Flash flooding is
ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through Dry Creek and Pine Creek. The debris flow can consist
of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.

flash flooding.
