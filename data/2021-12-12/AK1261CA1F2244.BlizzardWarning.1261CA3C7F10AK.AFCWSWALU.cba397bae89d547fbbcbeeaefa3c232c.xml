<headline>Blizzard Warning issued December 12 at 7:57AM AKST until December 14 at 12:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM MONDAY TO MIDNIGHT AKST
MONDAY NIGHT FROM DILLINGHAM NORTH AND WEST...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions expected. Total snow accumulations
of up to 5 inches. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...Dillingham north and west.
* WHEN...From 9 AM Monday to midnight AKST Monday night.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be difficult. Visibilities reduced to one
quarter mile or less at times. Arctic air temperatures combined
with the wind will cause wind chills to be as low as 35 degrees
below zero which could cause frostbite in as little as 10 to 15
minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The rest of the Bristol Bay area will see
snow, but winds are not expected to be nearly as strong as in
Dillingham and areas north and west of Dillingham. Visibilities
could still drop as low as one mile or less in these other
areas.</description>
<instruction>A Blizzard Warning means severe winter weather conditions are
expected or occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds
and poor visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout
conditions, making travel very hazardous. If you must travel,
have a winter survival kit with you.If you get stranded, stay
with your vehicle.</instruction>
