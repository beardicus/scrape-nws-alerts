<description>...Dangerous Winter Storm to Produce Very Heavy Snow with Strong
Winds and Whiteout Conditions...
.A strong winter storm will bring very heavy snow to the
mountains of northern California. Snow is falling over portions
of I- 5 north of Redding and will spread southeast into the
southern Cascades and northern Sierra into Sunday morning. Snow
levels will gradually lower over time through late Monday and
Tuesday. Expect tremendous snow accumulations at pass levels with
yardsticks required for snow measurement. This will results in
significant travel delays with extremely difficult to impossible
travel over the mountains. Strong winds will further reduce
visibilities during this event with whiteout conditions.

impossible. Additional snow accumulations of 6 to 15 inches
along I 5 from Shasta Lake to Sims and Castella. Localized
amounts up to 4 to 6 feet possible above 4,000 ft.
* WHERE...Snow level down to 1,000 feet at times including the
Shasta Lake Area / Northern Shasta County and Mountains
Southwestern Shasta County to Western Colusa County.
* WHEN...Until 4 AM Tuesday.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Be prepared for significant reductions in
visibility at times with white-out conditions.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

roads and limited visibilities. Travel is not recommended while
the warning is in effect. If you must travel, keep an extra
flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case of an
