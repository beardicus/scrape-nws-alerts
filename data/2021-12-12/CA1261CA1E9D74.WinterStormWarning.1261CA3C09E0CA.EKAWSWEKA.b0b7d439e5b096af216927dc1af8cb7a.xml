<description>...PERIODS OF HEAVY MOUNTAIN SNOW LATE TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY,
WITH LOWERING SNOW LEVELS...
In between storm systems, lighter showery precipitation will
linger today with snow levels tending to rise into the 3000 to
4000 ft range later this morning through tonight. Snow levels
should be above 3500 feet across most of our area Monday morning.
Steadier precipitation will move in tonight ahead of another cold
front, resulting in heavy mountain snow along the highest portions
of highway 36 and highway 3.
As the cold front moves through from midday through Monday
afternoon, snow levels will lower while some heavy precipitation
lingers. Snow levels will drop below 2500 feet in the afternoon
across Humboldt County, even reaching 2000 feet Monday evening
across most of northwest California. That will allow for heavy
snow around Berry Summit. Fortunately precipitation become lighter
and more showery Monday evening, with lighter accumulations on
the passes farther east along the Highway 299 corridor. Some minor
accumulations of a coating to locally as much as 2 inches will be
possible at low elevations through Tuesday morning as snow levels
lower near or even below 1000 feet.
...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 10 PM THIS EVENING TO
10 PM PST MONDAY ABOVE 3500 FEET...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected above 3500 feet. Total snow
accumulations of 5 to 10 inches along high elevation portions of
Highway 3 and 36, with another 12 to 18 inches at Scott Mountain
Summit.
* WHERE...Northern Trinity and Southern Trinity Counties.
* WHEN...From 10 PM this evening to 10 PM PST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible along
high elevation portions of Highways 3 and 36, with slippery,
snow-covered roads and poor visibility.</description>
