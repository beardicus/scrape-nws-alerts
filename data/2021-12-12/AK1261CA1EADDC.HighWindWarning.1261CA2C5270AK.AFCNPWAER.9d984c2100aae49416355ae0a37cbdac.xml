<headline>High Wind Warning issued December 12 at 4:59AM AKST until December 12 at 6:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AKST THIS EVENING
THROUGH THOMPSON PASS...
* WHAT...Northeast winds 30 to 50 mph with gusts up to 75 mph
expected.
* WHERE...Thompson Pass.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM AKST this evening.
* IMPACTS...High winds may move loose debris, damage property, and
cause power outages. Travel will be difficult, especially for
high profile vehicles. The combination of very cold temperatures
and strong winds will drive wind chills down to 40 below zero
today and even further to near 50 below zero tonight into
Monday. Strong winds could transport snow and abruptly reduce
visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Winds will continue to steadily increase
this morning. While warning level gusts are not expected for
the town of Valdez at this time, gusts to 55 mph will be
possible. No new snowfall is expected with this system, but any
transportable snow could easily be blown around. Be prepared for
sudden reductions to visibility less than one half mile through
the pass.</description>
<instruction>Wind chills of 40 below zero will cause frostbite on exposed skin
in as little as 10 minutes.
People are urged to secure loose objects that could be blown
around or damaged by the wind. Prepare for the possibility of
widespread power outages. Use caution if you must drive.</instruction>
