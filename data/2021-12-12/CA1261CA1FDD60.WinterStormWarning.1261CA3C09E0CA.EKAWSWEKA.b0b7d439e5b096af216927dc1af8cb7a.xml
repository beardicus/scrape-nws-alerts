<description>...PERIODS OF HEAVY MOUNTAIN SNOW LATE TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY,
WITH LOWERING SNOW LEVELS...
Light rain and snow showers continue across the area this
afternoon with snow levels around 3,500 to 4,000 feet. Snow
levels should be above 3500 feet in the north and above 4,500 feet
in the south. Steadier precipitation will move in tonight ahead
of another cold front, resulting in heavy mountain snow along the
highest portions of highway 36 and highway 3.
As the cold front moves through on Monday, snow levels will lower
while some heavy precipitation lingers. Snow levels will drop
below 2500 feet in the afternoon across Humboldt County, even
reaching 2000 feet Monday evening across most of northwest
California. That will allow for heavy snow around Berry Summit.
Monday night snow levels will continue to fall as snow showers
diminish. Some minor accumulations will be possible at elevations
as low as 1,000 feet by Tuesday morning.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 10 PM THIS EVENING
TO 10 PM PST MONDAY ABOVE 3500 FEET...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected above 3500 feet. Total snow
accumulations of 6 to 12 inches. Local amounts to 2 feet at
Scott Mountain Pass.
* WHERE...Southern Trinity and Northern Trinity Counties.
* WHEN...From 10 PM this evening to 10 PM PST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Up to 2 inches is possible down to 2,000
feet Monday evening and overnight. This would impact the summits
on Highway 299 and Highway 3.</description>
