<description>...PERIODS OF HEAVY MOUNTAIN SNOW LATE TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY,
WITH LOWERING SNOW LEVELS...
In between storm systems, lighter showery precipitation will
linger today with snow levels tending to rise into the 3000 to
4000 ft range later this morning through tonight. Snow levels
should be above 3500 feet across most of our area Monday morning.
Steadier precipitation will move in tonight ahead of another cold
front, resulting in heavy mountain snow along the highest portions
of highway 36 and highway 3.
As the cold front moves through from midday through Monday
afternoon, snow levels will lower while some heavy precipitation
lingers. Snow levels will drop below 2500 feet in the afternoon
across Humboldt County, even reaching 2000 feet Monday evening
across most of northwest California. That will allow for heavy
snow around Berry Summit. Fortunately precipitation become lighter
and more showery Monday evening, with lighter accumulations on
the passes farther east along the Highway 299 corridor. Some minor
accumulations of a coating to locally as much as 2 inches will be
possible at low elevations through Tuesday morning as snow levels
lower near or even below 1000 feet.
...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM TO 10 PM PST MONDAY
ABOVE 2500 FEET...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected above 2500 feet. Total snow
accumulations of 5 to 9 inches at Berry Summit on Highway 299,
with higher amounts possible on other rural travel corridors
above 3000 feet.
* WHERE...Northern Humboldt Interior and Southern Humboldt
Interior Counties.
* WHEN...From 10 AM to 10 PM PST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult along Highway 299 near
Berry Summit, with slippery, snow-covered road conditions and
poor visibility. Some high elevation rural roadways may become
impassable.</description>
