<description>...PERIODS OF HEAVY MOUNTAIN SNOW TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...
Steady precipitation will spread inland tonight ahead of another
cold front, resulting in heavy mountain snow along the highest
portions of highway 36 and highway 3 in Trinity County. Snow
levels will lower during Monday below 2000 feet in the afternoon
across Humboldt and Del Norte County. That will allow for heavy
snow around Berry Summit and Collier Tunnel. Monday night snow
levels will continue to fall as snow showers diminish. Some minor
accumulations will be possible at elevations as low as 1,000 feet
by Tuesday morning across Mendocino and Lake Counties.

* WHAT...Heavy snow above 3000 feet. Additional snow
accumulations of 5 to 24 inches.
