<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued September 16 at 3:46AM AKDT until September 18 at 10:00AM AKDT by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM THIS EVENING
TO 10 AM AKDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Significant coastal flooding expected.
* WHERE...Eastern Norton Sound and Nulato Hills.
* WHEN...From 6 PM Friday to 10 AM AKDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Numerous roads may be closed. Low lying property
including homes, businesses, and some critical infrastructure
will be inundated. Some shoreline erosion will occur.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...From Shaktoolik to Stebbins water levels
will be 8 to 12 feet above the normal high tide line. The
Shaktoolik Airport will be impacted. The high water may surround
some building in Shaktoolik. In Unalakleet water will inundate
areas around the AC store and Lodge. Flooding will also occur in
the north end of town, and in low lying areas around the runway.
Roads and houses near the coast at Stebbins and St Michael will
be flooded. In Elim and Koyuk water levels will be 12 to 18
feet above the normal high tide line. At Elim the water and
sewer system may back up as high water and persistent southeast
winds push water up the creek and may contaminate the water
supply. At Koyuk water will back up in the Koyuk River and Creek
with flooding around the store warehouse and other low lying
areas. Highest water levels are expected Saturday afternoon
through Sunday morning.</description>

travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.</instruction>
