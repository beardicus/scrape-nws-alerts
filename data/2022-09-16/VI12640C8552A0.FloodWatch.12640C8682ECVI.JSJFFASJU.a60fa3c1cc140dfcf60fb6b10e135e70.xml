<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THIS EVENING THROUGH MONDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall associated
with the passage of Fiona
* WHERE...Portions of Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands.
* WHEN...From Friday evening through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone
locations, as well as mudslides and rockfalls in areas of
steep terrain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Fiona is now located 265 miles east-southeast of the Leeward
Islands and is expected move near or just south of the Virgin
Islands and Puerto Rico late Saturday into Sunday. However,
showers and thunderstorms associated with Tropical Storm Fiona
are forecast to reach Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
as early as tonight. These activity will continue to affect
the local islands through at least Monday, increasing the risk
for flash flooding across most of the forecast area. Soils
are already saturated across areas of higher terrain and, as a
result, mudslides and rockfalls are possible as well.
- Based on the most recent guidance, the most likely time period
for the heaviest rainfall activity falls between Saturday and
Sunday. So far, the areas most likely to receive the highest
rainfall accumulations are portions of eastern and southern
Puerto Rico, where there is a potential for rainfall totals to
reach 6 to 8 inches with locally higher amounts around 10
inches. The U.S. Virgin Islands has the potential to observe
rainfall totals between 4 and 6 inches. Elsewhere, expect
rainfall totals to range between 2 and 4 inches.
