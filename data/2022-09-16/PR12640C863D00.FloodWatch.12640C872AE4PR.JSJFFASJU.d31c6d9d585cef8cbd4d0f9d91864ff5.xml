and the U.S. Virgin Islands as early as tonight. The risk for
flash flooding is increased across most of the forecast area.
Saturated soils further increase the risk for mudslides and
rockfalls in areas of steeper terrain.
Heaviest rainfall is currently forecast for Saturday through
Monday. Highest rainfall amounts are anticipated for
southeastern and southwestern Puerto Rico, where 8 to 12
inches of rain are forecast over the duration of the event.
Significant rain and impacts are anticipated elsewhere, as
well, including: In southern and eastern Puerto Rico,
rainfall totals of 6 to 8 inches are expected. In the U.S.
Virgin Islands, between 4 and 6 inches of rain are forecast.
Elsewhere, rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches are expected.
