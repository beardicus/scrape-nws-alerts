SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
A Tropical Storm Watch remains in effect for the U.S. Virgin Islands
and Puerto Rico. Tropical storm conditions are possible as early as
Saturday morning. At 8 AM AST (12 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm
Fiona was located about 175 miles east of Guadalupe. The current
forecast track still brings the center of Fiona just south of the
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico late Saturday into Sunday. The main
threat with this system remains the rainfall, with totals in excess of
8 inches expected for some portions of the local islands. This amount
of rainfall will result in life-threatening flash and urban flooding,
as well as mudslides or rockfalls and river flooding. The greatest
threat for these dangerous flooding conditions is Saturday through at
least Monday. Marine and coastal conditions are also forecast to
deteriorate, starting as early as today. Seas building to around 12
feet are forecast, continuing through the weekend. Maximum sustained
winds to near 50 mph with higher gusts are expected for portions of the
forecast area.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across eastern and southern sections of Puerto Rico.
Potential impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, arroyos, and
ditches may become dangerous rivers. In mountain areas,
destructive runoff may run quickly down valleys while
increasing susceptibility to rockslides and mudslides. Flood
control systems and barriers may become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.
Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with
underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.
Many road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
Prepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant
impacts across eastern sections of Puerto Rico.
* WIND:
Prepare for dangerous wind having possible significant impacts across
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Potential impacts in this
area include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
* SURGE:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time across Puerto Rico
and the US Virgin Islands.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a waterspouts having possible limited impacts across the
local waters of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Potential
impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated waterspouts.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
If you are exceptionally vulnerable to wind or water hazards from
tropical systems, consider voluntary evacuation, especially if being
officially recommended. Relocate to a predetermined shelter or safe
destination.
If evacuating away from the area or relocating to a nearby shelter,
leave early before weather conditions become hazardous.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and take necessary
actions to secure your home or business. Deliberate efforts should be
underway to protect life and property. Ensure that your Emergency
Supplies Kit is stocked and ready.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track as there are inherent forecast uncertainties
which must be taken into account.
Always heed the advice of local officials and comply with any orders
that are issued. Do not needlessly jeopardize your life or the lives
of others.
Visitors to the area should become familiar with nearby surroundings.
If you are a visitor, know the name of the county or parish in which
you are located and where it is relative to current watches and
warnings. If staying at a hotel, ask the management staff about their
onsite disaster plan. Listen for evacuation orders, especially
pertaining to area visitors.
Closely monitor NOAA Weather Radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for possible changes to the
forecast.
