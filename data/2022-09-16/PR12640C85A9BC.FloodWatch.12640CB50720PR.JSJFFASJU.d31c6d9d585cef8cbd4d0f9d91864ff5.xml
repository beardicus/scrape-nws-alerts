Fiona, which is forecast to pass by just south of the region
late Saturday into Sunday, are forecast to reach Puerto Rico
and the U.S. Virgin Islands as early as tonight. The risk for
flash flooding is increased across most of the forecast area.
Saturated soils further increase the risk for mudslides and
rockfalls in areas of steeper terrain.
Heaviest rainfall is currently forecast for Saturday through
Sunday. Highest rainfall amounts are anticipated for eastern
and southern Puerto Rico. In those areas, rainfall totals of
6 to 8 inches are expected, with locally higher amounts of
around 12 inches. In the U.S. Virgin Islands, between 4 and 6
inches of rain are forecast. Elsewhere, rainfall totals of 2
to 4 inches is expected.
