<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued September 16 at 4:51AM AKDT until September 17 at 4:00PM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM THIS EVENING
TO 4 PM AKDT SATURDAY...
* LOCATION...The Kuskokwim Delta Coast, including Kuskokwim Bay.
Highest water levels will be from the Kuskokwim River mouth
and to the northwest.
* COASTAL FLOODING...Water levels are expected to rise 5 to 8
feet above the normal highest tide line.
* TIMING...From this evening through Saturday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Low lying areas could flood. Some critical
infrastructure may be inundated. Some shoreline erosion could
occur.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A powerful low pressure system in the
Western Bering this morning will move northeast towards St.
Lawrence Island through Saturday morning. As it moves north,
northwesterly winds will increase through the day today. The combination
of strong winds and fetch will produce a storm surge along the
coast, leading to coastal flooding and the potential for coastal
erosion along the Kuskokwim Delta coast.</description>
<instruction>A coastal flood warning means that flooding is occurring or
imminent. Coastal residents in the warned area should be alert
for rising water, and take appropriate action to protect life and
property.</instruction>
