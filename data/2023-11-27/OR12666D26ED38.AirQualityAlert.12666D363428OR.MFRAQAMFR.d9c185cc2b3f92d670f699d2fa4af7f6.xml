<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST THURSDAY...
Oregon Department of Environmental Quality has issued an Air
Pollution Advisory...in effect until 10 AM PST Thursday.
The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality issued an air quality
advisory for Jackson and Josephine County and the Klamath Falls.
Check current air quality conditions and advisories on DEQ’s Air
Quality Index or by downloading the OregonAIR on your app on your
smartphone.
Many county health and local air agencies have also issued wood
burning restrictions limiting the use of wood stoves, fireplaces and
outdoor burning. There are often exceptions for those who use wood
exclusively to heat their homes and those with limited income. Check
with your local heath or air agency for current restrictions.
People can take the following precautions to protect their health:
- Follow local burn restrictions to prevent deteriorating air
quality.
- Avoid strenuous outdoor activity during periods of poor air quality.
- People with heart or lung problems and young children are
especially vulnerable. These people should stay indoors while smoke
levels are high.
- Use certified High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters in
indoor heating, ventilation, cooling and air purification systems.
- Avoid using wood-burning stoves and other sources of indoor smoke
if possible.
DEQ’s color-coded Air Quality Index provides current air quality
conditions and ranks air quality as follows: Green is good. Yellow is
moderate. Orange is unhealthy for sensitive groups such as children,
the elderly, pregnant women and those with respiratory conditions.
Red is unhealthy for everyone. Purple is very unhealthy for all
groups. Maroon is hazardous.
