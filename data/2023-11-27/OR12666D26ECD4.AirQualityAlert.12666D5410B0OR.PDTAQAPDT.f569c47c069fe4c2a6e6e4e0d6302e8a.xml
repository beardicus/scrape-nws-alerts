<description>...AIR QUALITY ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 AM PST THURSDAY FOR LA
PINE...
Oregon Department of Environmental Quality has issued an Air Quality
Advisory...IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 AM PST THURSDAY.
The Oregon Department of Enviornmental Quality has issued an air
quality advisory for La Pine due to stagnant air conditions trapping
smoke and other air pollutants near the ground where people breathe.
Many county health and local air agencies have also issued wood
burning restrictions limiting the use of wood stoves, fireplaces, and
outdoor burning. There are often exceptions for those who use wood
exclusively to heat their homes and those with limited income. Check
with your local health or air agency for current restrictions.
People can take the following precautions to protect their health:
- Follow local burn restrictions to prevent deteriorating air
quality.
- Avoid strenuous outdoor acitivity in smoky conditions.
- People with heart or lung problems and young children are
expecially vulnerable. These people should stay indoors while smoke
levels are high.
- Use certified High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters in
indoor heating, ventilation, cooling, and air purification systems.
- Avoid using wood-burning stoves and other sources of indoor smoke
if possible.
