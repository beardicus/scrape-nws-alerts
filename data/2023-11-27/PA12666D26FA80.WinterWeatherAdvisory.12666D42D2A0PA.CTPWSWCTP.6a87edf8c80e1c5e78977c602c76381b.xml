<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued November 27 at 6:52PM EST until November 29 at 1:00AM EST by NWS State College</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM EST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Lake effect snow. Total snow accumulations of 2 to 7
inches. The higher amounts will be north of Route 6 and west
of Bradford.
* WHERE...McKean County.
* WHEN...Until 1 AM EST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be difficult. The hazardous conditions
could impact the morning and evening commutes, especially on
Tuesday.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The heaviest snow and most significant
impacts will occur after midnight tonight, through Tuesday as
the single, intense snow band over Eastern Lake Erie this
evening drifts gradually south into the advisory area and breaks
into several bands. Snowfall rates may reach 1&quot; per hour for
brief times within the strongest snow bands. Gusty winds will
also lead to blowing and drifting snow with periods of very low
visibility of less than one quarter of a mile.</description>
<instruction>The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and Pennsylvania
Turnpike Commission remind motorists to adjust speeds based on
driving conditions as winter weather impacts will include snow
covered roads and limited visibility in some areas.
Call 5 1 1 or visit www.511pa.com for the latest travel, roadway
and traffic conditions.
