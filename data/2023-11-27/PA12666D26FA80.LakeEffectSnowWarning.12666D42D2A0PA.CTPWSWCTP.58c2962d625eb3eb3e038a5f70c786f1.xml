<headline>Lake Effect Snow Warning issued November 27 at 6:52PM EST until November 29 at 1:00AM EST by NWS State College</headline>
<description>...LAKE EFFECT SNOW WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM EST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy lake effect snow. Snow accumulations of 6 to 10
inches north of Route 6, and lesser amounts across the
southern part of the county.
* WHERE...Warren County.
* WHEN...Until 1 AM EST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning and evening commutes,
especially on Tuesday.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The heaviest snow and most significant
impacts will occur after midnight tonight, through Tuesday as
the single, intense snow band over Eastern Lake Erie this
evening drifts gradually south into the warned area and breaks
into several bands. Snowfall rates may reach 1&quot; per hour for
brief times within the strongest snow bands. Gusty winds will
also lead to blowing and drifting snow with periods of very low
visibility of less than one quarter of a mile.</description>
<instruction>The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and Pennsylvania
Turnpike Commission strongly encourage motorists to heed all
travel restrictions and delay unnecessary travel as significant
winter weather conditions will make travel very hazardous.
Call 5 1 1 or visit www.511pa.com for the latest travel, roadway
and traffic conditions.
To report snow or ice, post to the NWS State College Facebook
page, use Twitter @NWSStateCollege, or visit weather.gov/ctp.</instruction>
