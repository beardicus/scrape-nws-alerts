<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM CDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has issued an Air
Quality Alert for fine particles pollution. The Air Quality
Index (AQI) is expected to reach the Orange or Unhealthy for
Sensitive Groups category.
* WHERE...east central Minnesota.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM CDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease
(including asthma), heart disease, and children and older
adults, may experience health effects.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Heavy ground-level smoke from wildfires in
northern Alberta and British Columbia will impact central
Minnesota on Sunday. Light northerly winds have brought this
smoke into the northern half of the Twin Cities metro. Fine
particle levels will reach the Orange (Unhealthy for Sensitive
Groups) category across central Minnesota, including the
northern half of the Twin Cities metro on Sunday. Air quality
across the southern Twin Cities metro and south central
Minnesota will be in the Yellow (moderate) category. Winds will
become southerly during the overnight hours on Monday and the
smoke will begin to retreat north. Air quality should improve
below the Orange category by Monday morning across the Twin
Cities. Across central Minnesota, air quality is expected to
improve below the Orange category by Monday evening.

<instruction>Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including
asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults, should
limit prolonged or heavy exertion.
Reduce or eliminate activities that contribute to air pollution,
such as outdoor burning, and use of residential wood burning
devices. Reduce vehicle trips and vehicle idling as much as
possible.
Keep windows closed overnight to prevent smoke from getting
indoors.</instruction>
