<headline>Flood Advisory issued July 23 at 6:26PM EDT until July 23 at 7:30PM EDT by NWS Charleston</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 930 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of southeast South Carolina, including the
following counties, Berkeley, Charleston and Dorchester.
* WHEN...Until 930 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
Water over roadways. Overflowing poor drainage areas. Ponding of
water in urban or other areas is occurring or is imminent.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 621 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms with
torrential rains beginning to redevelop over much of the
Charleston Metro Area and nearby communities. Some areas have
already observed between 2 and 6 inches of rain so far today.
With heavy rain expected to move back into the area soon, the
risk for minor flooding of low-lying and poor drainage areas
will steadily increase. Pockets of flash flooding could also
occur, especially areas around North Charleston, including
the Park Circle Area. Roads could become flooded in Downtown
Charleston, so make appropriate plans now.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 4 inches are expected
over the area. This additional rain will result in minor
flooding.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
North Charleston, Mount Pleasant, Summerville, Goose Creek,
Hanahan, I-26/I-526 Interchange, Naval Weapons Station
Charleston, West Ashley, Daniel Island, Downtown Charleston,
Ladson, James Island, Fort Sumter, Johns Island, Hollywood,
Isle Of Palms, Folly Beach, Ravenel, Ridgeville and
Sullivan`s Island.</description>
<instruction>Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.
Report flooding directly to the Charleston National Weather Service
at 1-888-383-2024 or email your reports to nws.charlestonsc@noaa.gov.</instruction>
