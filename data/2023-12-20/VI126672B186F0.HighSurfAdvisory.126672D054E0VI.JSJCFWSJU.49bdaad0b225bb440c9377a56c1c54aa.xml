<headline>High Surf Advisory issued December 20 at 4:12PM AST until December 22 at 6:00PM AST by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE FRIDAY
NIGHT...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Life-threatening rip currents due to rough surf and large
breaking waves 6-12 feet and locally higher at times.
* WHERE...Beaches of St Croix.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through the weekend. For
the High Surf, until 6 PM AST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming conditions. Rip currents that can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water
where it becomes difficult to return to safety.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.
A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in
the advisory area, producing localized beach erosion and
dangerous swimming conditions.</instruction>
