<headline>Coastal Flood Watch issued September 14 at 4:19PM AKDT until September 17 at 10:00AM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
SATURDAY MORNING FOR THE KUSKOKWIM DELTA COAST...
The National Weather Service in Anchorage has issued a Coastal
Flood Watch, which is in effect from Friday afternoon through
Saturday morning.
* LOCATION...The Kuskokwim Delta Coast, including Kuskokwim Bay.
* COASTAL FLOODING...Water levels are expected to rise 4 to 7
feet above the normal highest tide line.
* TIMING...From Friday afternoon through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Low lying areas could flood. Some critical
infrastructure may be inundated. Some shoreline erosion could
occur.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A potent storm system, the extra-tropical
remnants of Typhoon Merbok, is expected to move from the
Northern Pacific Thursday, through the Southern Bering Thursday
night and Friday morning, and into the Northern Bering Sea late
Friday into Saturday. Winds are expected to increase by late
morning Friday and continue through Saturday morning before
slowly diminishing Saturday night. The combination of strong
winds and fetch will also produce a storm surge along the coast,
leading to the potential for coastal erosion and flooding along
the Kuskokwim Delta coast.</description>
<instruction>A coastal flood watch means that conditions favorable for
flooding are expected to develop. Coastal residents should be
alert for later statements or warnings, and take action to
protect property.</instruction>
