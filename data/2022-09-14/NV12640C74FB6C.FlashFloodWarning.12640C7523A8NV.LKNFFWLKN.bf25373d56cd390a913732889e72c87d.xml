* Flash Flood Warning for...
North Central Elko County in northeastern Nevada...

heavy rain across the warned area. Between 0.1 and 0.4 inches of
rain have fallen. The expected rainfall rate is 0.5 inches in 15
minutes. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.

rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.

areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as

EXPECTED RAINFALL RATE...0.5 INCHES IN 15 MINUTES</description>

terrain, especially in and around these areas.</instruction>
