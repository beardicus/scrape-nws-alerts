<description>...Coastal Flooding Along The West Coast of Alaska Possible Friday
Night into Sunday
A series of very strong Bering Sea storms will bring strong winds and
heavy rain to Western Alaska tonight through the weekend. A low
now in the Western Bering Sea will deepen rapidly and move to the
Central Bering Sea this afternoon, and to the Yukon Delta on
Thursday. This storm will produce elevated surf along the West
Coast south of the Bering Strait from tonight into Thursday.
A second and much stronger storm, with the remnants of Typhoon
Merbok, will move north into the Central Bering Sea on Friday,
and to the Bering Strait on Saturday morning. This storm will
bring very strong winds and heavy rain to most of the West Coast
over the weekend. This will bring the threat of major coastal
flooding along the West Coast south of the Bering Strait,
including Little Diomede and St Lawrence Islands, from Friday
night into Sun. There is also a possibility of coastal flooding
from the Bering Strait to Point Hope from Saturday into Sunday.
The Yukon River through the Yukon Delta could see flooding this
weekend with the storm surge backing up the river.
This second storm has the potential to cause flooding this weekend
nearly as bad as the storm of November 2011. People along the West
Coast and Yukon Delta should prepare now for potential flooding,
heavy rain and high winds this weekend.</description>
