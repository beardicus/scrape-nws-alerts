<description>The National Weather Service in Elko has extended the
* Flash Flood Warning for...
North Central Elko County in northeastern Nevada...
* Until 930 PM PDT.
* At 819 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing
heavy rain across the warned area. Between 0.1 and 0.4 inches of
rain have fallen. The expected rainfall rate is 0.5 inches in 15
minutes. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through the Wildcat burn scar. The debris flow can consist of
rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban
areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as
other poor drainage and low-lying areas.

mainly rural areas of North Central Elko County
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
EXPECTED RAINFALL RATE...0.5 INCHES IN 15 MINUTES</description>
<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.</instruction>
