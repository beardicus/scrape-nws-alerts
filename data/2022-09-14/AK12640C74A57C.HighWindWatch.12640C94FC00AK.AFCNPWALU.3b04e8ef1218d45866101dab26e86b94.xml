<headline>High Wind Watch issued September 14 at 4:07PM AKDT until September 17 at 4:00AM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY MORNING THROUGH
LATE FRIDAY NIGHT FOR THE PRIBILOF ISLANDS...
* WHAT...Southwest winds 50 to 65 mph with gusts up to 85 mph
possible.
* WHERE...Pribilof Islands.
* WHEN...From Friday morning through late Friday night.
* IMPACTS...High winds may move loose debris, damage property, and
cause power outages. Travel will be difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Typhoon Merbok will transition to a
strong extra-tropical low pressure system and is expected to
intensify as it moves from the Northwest Pacific Ocean into
the Bering Sea from Thursday to Saturday. There is some
uncertainty in the storm track on Friday, but current
forecasts indicate a swath of strong southwesterly winds
moving over the Islands Friday. Currently St. Paul is favored
to get higher winds than St. George due to the proximity to
the low center, which is forecast to be west of St. Matthew
Island by Friday afternoon. However, both areas are still
forecast to receive gusts in the 70 to 85 mph range with the
current forecast.</description>
<instruction>Monitor the latest forecasts and warnings for updates on this
situation. Fasten loose objects or shelter objects in a safe
location prior to the onset of winds.</instruction>
