<description>...HIGH WIND WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY EVENING
THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Southwest winds 50 to 70 mph with gusts up to 90 mph
possible.
* WHERE...Western and Central Aleutians.
* WHEN...From Thursday evening through Friday morning.
* IMPACTS...High winds may move loose debris, damage property, and
cause power outages. Travel will be difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Typhoon Merbok will transition to an extra-
tropical low pressure system and is expected to intensify as it
moves from the Northwest Pacific Ocean into the Bering Sea from
Thursday to Saturday. Initially, winds will be south to
southwest out ahead of the low, then switch to the west as the
low passes to the north. Some uncertainty remains regarding the
exact track and intensity. The latest forecast shows the core of
the strongest winds in an area between Attu Island to Adak with
the strongest winds peaking early Friday morning. The winds
should begin to slowly diminish through the day Friday.</description>
