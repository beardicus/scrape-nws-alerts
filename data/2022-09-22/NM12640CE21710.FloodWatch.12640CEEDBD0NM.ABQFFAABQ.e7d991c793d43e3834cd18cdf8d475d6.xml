<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of north central, northwest, and west central New
Mexico, including the following areas, in north central New
Mexico, Far Northwest Highlands and Northwest Highlands. In
northwest New Mexico, Chuska Mountains and Northwest Plateau. In
west central New Mexico, West Central Mountains and West Central
Plateau.
* WHEN...Through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water crossings may be
flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Deep monsoon moisture will remain in place, leading to
widespread shower and thunderstorm activity. Stronger
thunderstorms will be capable of producing heavy rain at
rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour. Locations where the ground
is already saturated from recent rainfall, recent burn scars,
and places where multiple storms train over the same location
will be favored areas for flash flooding this afternoon and
evening.
