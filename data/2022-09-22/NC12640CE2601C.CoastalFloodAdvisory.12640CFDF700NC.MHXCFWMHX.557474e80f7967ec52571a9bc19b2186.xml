feet of inundation above ground level expected in low-lying
areas near shorelines and tidal waterways. For the Beach Hazards

the surf zone.
* WHERE...East Carteret County, and Ocracoke Island and Hatteras
Island.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 2 AM EDT Saturday.
For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 8 PM EDT Friday. For the
Beach Hazards Statement, until 8 PM EDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Dangerous swimming and
surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip currents
can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper
water. Dangerous shore break can throw a swimmer or surfer
head first into the bottom causing neck and back injuries.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
