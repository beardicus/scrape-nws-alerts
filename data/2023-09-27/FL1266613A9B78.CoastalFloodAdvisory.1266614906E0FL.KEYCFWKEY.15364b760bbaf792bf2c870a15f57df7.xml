<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued September 27 at 3:50PM EDT until September 28 at 10:00AM EDT by NWS Key West</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM EDT THURSDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT IS CANCELLED...
* WHAT...Saltwater flooding.
* WHERE...Lower Florida Keys.
* WHEN...Until 10 AM EDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Saltwater flooding of low elevation streets and lots
is expected. Some storm drains will overflow, and some
seawalls and docks will be overtopped. Boaters can expect less
clearance under fixed bridges. Motorists should remember that
persistent puddles around the times of high tide are almost
certain to contain a mix of saltwater.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The combination of locally heavy rainfall
with rising King tides will result in brackish flooding during
the morning high tides. Water levels may reach a few inches
higher than this morning`s high tide.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
