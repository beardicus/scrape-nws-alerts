<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued September 27 at 4:16AM EDT until September 28 at 9:00AM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM EDT THURSDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor to moderate ocean
overwash producing one to two feet of inundation above ground
level for ocean-adjacent properties and roadways. For the High
Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 5 to 9 feet in the surf
zone. For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents,
large breaking waves expected, and strong longshore currents in
the surf zone.
* WHERE...Northern Outer Banks and Hatteras Island.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 9 AM EDT
Thursday. For the High Surf Advisory, until 9 PM EDT this
evening. For the Beach Hazards Statement, from 8 AM EDT this
morning through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Ocean overwash around the times of high tide will
produce up to 1 to 2 ft of inundation above ground level near
vulnerable dune structures resulting in an elevated threat of
property damage. A few secondary roadways could be inundated.
Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach
erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from
shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw a
swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom causing neck and
back injuries. Strong longshore currents will create dangerous
swimming conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Ocean overwash is possible around the times
of high tide, around 6 AM and 6 PM today.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
