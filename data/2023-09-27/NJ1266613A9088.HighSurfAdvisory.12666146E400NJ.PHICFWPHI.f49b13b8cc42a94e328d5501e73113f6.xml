<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM EDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of up
to 8 feet in the surf zone. For the High Rip Current Risk,
dangerous rip currents. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to
one foot of inundation above ground level is expected in low-
lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...The coasts of Monmouth County and Ocean County in New
Jersey.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Thursday evening.
For the High Surf Advisory, until 8:00 PM this evening. For the
Coastal Flood Advisory, until 1:00 AM Thursday.
* IMPACTS...At this level, flooding begins on the most vulnerable
roads in coastal and bayside communities, and along inland
tidal waterways. Some partial or full road closures are
possible. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion are expected. Rip currents can sweep
even the best swimmers away from shore and into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Water levels will remain elevated into the
weekend, with minor or near minor tidal flooding possible with
the nighttime high tides on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
