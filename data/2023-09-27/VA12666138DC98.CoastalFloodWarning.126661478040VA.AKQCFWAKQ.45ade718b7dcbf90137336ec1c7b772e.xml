<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued September 27 at 4:06AM EDT until September 28 at 12:00AM EDT by NWS Wakefield</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EDT
TONIGHT...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 AM EDT THURSDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, one to two feet of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking
waves of 7 to 9 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards
Statement, a high risk of rip currents.
* WHERE...Northampton County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, until midnight EDT
tonight. For the High Surf Advisory, until 2 AM EDT Thursday.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Widespread flooding of vulnerable areas will result in
an elevated threat of property damage to homes and businesses
near the waterfront and shoreline. Water will be 1 to 2 feet
above ground level in some areas resulting in a sufficient depth
to close numerous roads and threaten homes and businesses.
Flooding will extend inland from the waterfront along tidal
rivers and bays resulting in some road closures and flooding of
vehicles. Large breaking waves of 7 to 9 ft will result in
dangerous surf conditions. Do not enter or approach the water
due to the risk of being swept away. Localized beach erosion is
also possible.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
