<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued September 27 at 6:47PM EDT until September 28 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Wakefield</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EDT
TONIGHT...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM EDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, up to two feet of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways. For the High Surf Advisory,
large breaking waves of 7 to 9 feet in the surf zone. For the
Beach Hazards Statement, a high risk of rip currents.
* WHERE...In North Carolina, Eastern Currituck County. In
Virginia, Virginia Beach.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, through Thursday
evening. For the Coastal Flood Warning, until midnight EDT
tonight. For the High Surf Advisory, until 6 AM EDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Widespread flooding of vulnerable areas will result
in an elevated threat of property damage to homes and
businesses near the waterfront and shoreline. Water will be 1
to 2 feet above ground level in some areas resulting in a
sufficient depth to close numerous roads and threaten homes
and businesses. Flooding will extend inland from the
waterfront along tidal rivers and bays resulting in some road
closures and flooding of vehicles. Large breaking waves of 7
to 9 ft will result in dangerous surf conditions. Do not enter
or approach the water due to the risk of being swept away.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
