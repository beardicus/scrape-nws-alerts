<description>...SNOW LASTING THROUGH SATURDAY...
.Low pressure over the NE Gulf will remain in place through
Friday night while an associated front with embedded waves will
move over the panhandle. A stronger wave along the front will
cause rates to pick up in the late afternoon and evening hours
Friday. Some uncertainty remains regarding snow totals due to
limited moisture in the central and northern inner channels. For
most areas the greatest snowfall rates continue to be Friday
evening through early Saturday morning while Yakutat may see snow
ending earlier.

SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Snow. Additional snow accumulations of 2 to 4 inches.
