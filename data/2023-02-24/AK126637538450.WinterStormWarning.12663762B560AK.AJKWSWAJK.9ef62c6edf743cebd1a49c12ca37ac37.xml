<description>...SNOW LASTING THROUGH SATURDAY...
.Low pressure over the NE Gulf will remain in place through Friday
while an associated front with embedded waves will move over the

snow totals due to limited moisture in the central and northern
inner channels. For most areas the greatest snowfall rates
continue to be Friday evening through early Saturday morning while
Yakutat may see snow ending earlier.
