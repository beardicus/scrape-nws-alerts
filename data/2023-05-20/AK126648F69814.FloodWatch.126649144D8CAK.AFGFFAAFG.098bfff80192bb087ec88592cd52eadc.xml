<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR SNOWMELT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Potential for high water due to snowmelt.
* WHERE...Porcupine River from the border to Fort Yukon
* WHEN...Through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...High water along the entire length of the Porcupine
River is now causing minor flooding of low-lying and flood-prone
locations along the Porcupine River. Residents at Fort Yukon
report that minor flooding is occuring near the Porcupine River
with one home cutoff by water, and that water continues to rise.
Additionally, minor flooding is occuring in some low lying areas
of Fort Yukon near the airport and water is rising slowly there.
If water continues to rise it could impact the runway at Fort
Yukon.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Warming temperatures are causing rapid snowmelt in the
Eastern Brooks Range and sending a large volume of water into
the Porcupine River. Warm temperatures continuing over the
weekend will likely increase the snowmelt, and cause the
already high water on the Porcupine River to rise slowly this
weekend.

- If you live near or along the Porcupine River stay alert and be
prepared to take action.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
