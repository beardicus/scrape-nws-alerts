<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY FOR AN ICE JAM REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1215 PM
AKDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues.
* WHERE...Yukon River between Tanana and the Nowitna River.
* WHEN...Until 1215 PM AKDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying areas along the Yukon River
between Tanana and Nowitna River, and minor flooding of the lower
Nowitna River. Flooding of low lying roads in Tanana is occuring
and will continue this weekend. Water levels are expected to
remain steady or rise slightly this weekend. Some areas of ponded
water will see water remain for a number of days.  Locations that
have ice onshore will have that ice remain for days until it
melts. Water levels along the river will fall slowly when the ice
jam breaks.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1220 PM AKDT Saturday, The River Watch Team reports that
the portion of the ice jam on the Yukon River from the mouth
of the Nowitna River to the Kokrine Bible Camp remains in
place. Water continues to flow over the banks in that area
and into the lower Nowitna River. Water also remains backed
up and overbank along the Yukon River upstream as far as
Tanana. When the ice broke loose on Friday evening, it was
apparently only the half of the jam that was downstream of
the Nowitna River. This means that water levels along the
Yukon from Tanana to the Nowitna River and along the lower
Nowitna River will remain steady or rise slightly this
weekend. Extensive flooding formed a large lake along and
upstream of where the ice jam is. Satellite imagery shows
that flooding was occuring 20 to 30 miles up the Nowitna
River, and along the Yukon River from the Nowitna River
upstream to Tanana. In Tanana, minor flooding of low lying
roads is occuring. The ice jam is expected to break later
this weekend. Water will slowly drain back into the river
once the jam breaks. Some poorly drained areas will keep
water for many days. Ice that is up on shore will remain for
many days until it melts.
-
- For Tanana:
At 4:00pm Friday the stage was 86.64 feet.
Flood Stage is 86.0 feet.

- If you live near or along the Yukon River between the Nowitna
River and Tanana, or along the lower Nowitna River, take action to
protect yourself from flooding. Water may remain high in poorly
drained areas many days.</description>
