<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR SNOWMELT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by snowmelt continues to be possible.
* WHERE...Porcupine River from the border to Fort Yukon
* WHEN...Through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding of low-lying locations along the
Porcupine River. Residents at Fort Yukon report that minor
flooding is occuring near the Porcupine River with one home cutoff
by water. Additionally, minor flooding is occuring in low lying
areas of Fort Yukon near the airport with water surrounding the
runway. Water is rising slowly there. If water continues to rise
it could impact the runway at Fort Yukon.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Warming temperatures are causing rapid snowmelt in the
Eastern Brooks Range and sending a large volume of water into
the Porcupine River. Warm temperatures continuing over the
weekend will likely increase the snowmelt, and cause the
already high water on the Porcupine River to rise slowly this
weekend. Should the water continue to rise at Fort Yukon
moderate flooding is possible and the airport could be
impacted, but this is uncertain at this time.

- If you live near or along the Porcupine River move valuables to
higher ground, and prepare to move yourself to higher ground at
short notice.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor water levels and prepare flooding to get worse.
Those living in areas prone to flooding should take action now and
move valuables to higher ground.</instruction>
