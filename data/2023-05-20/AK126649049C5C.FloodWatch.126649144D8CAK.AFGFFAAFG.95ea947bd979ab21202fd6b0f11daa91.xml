<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues to be possible.
* WHERE...For the Yukon River, from the mouth of the Nowitna River
to Nulato, including Galena, Koyukuk and Nulato.
* WHEN...Through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of low lying areas along the Yukon River is now
occurring near the Nowitna River area. Minor flooding is possible
in low lying areas along the Yukon River from the mouth of the
Nowitna River to Nulato. Water could rise rapidly. Ruby is not
expected to flood due to their elevation above the river.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A portion of the ice jam 20 miles upriver from Ruby on the
Yukon River released at 7pm on Friday evening. This sent a
surge of high water and ice down this section of the Yukon
River, and most of the water remained within the banks of the
river. At 1220 PM AKDT Saturday, The River Watch Team reports
that a portion of the ice jam on the Yukon River from the
mouth of the Nowitna River to the Kokrine Bible Camp remains
in place. Extensive flooding formed a large lake along and
upstream of where this ice jam with flooding 20 to 30 miles
up the Nowitna River, and along the Yukon River from the
Nowitna River upstream to Tanana. The ice jam is expected to
break later this weekend. When this jam breaks another surge
of high water and ice is expected to move down the Yukon
between the Nowitna River and Nulato with the risk of
flooding continuing through Monday. Any additional flooding
that occurs is expected to be minor flooding.
