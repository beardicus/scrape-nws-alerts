<description>...AIR QUALITY HEALTH ADVISORY FOR WILDFIRE SMOKE FROM 400 PM
SATURDAY UNTIL 900 AM SUNDAY...
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has
issued the following...
WHAT...Air Quality Health Advisory for Wildfire Smoke.
WHERE...Sedgwick, Logan, Crowley, Phillips, Morgan, Yuma,
Washington, Gilpin, Clear Creek, Elbert, Kit Carson, Lincoln,
Cheyenne, El Paso, Fremont, Kiowa, Pueblo, Bent, Prowers, Otero,
Huerfano, Las Animas and Baca Counties. Locations include, but are
not limited to Julesburg, Sterling, Ordway, Holyoke, Fort Morgan,
Wray, Akron, Central City, Georgetown, Kiowa, Burlington, Limon,
Cheyenne Wells, Colorado Springs, Canon City, Eads, Pueblo, Las
Animas, Lamar, La Junta, Walsenburg, Kim, Trinidad and
Springfield.
WHEN...400 PM Saturday May 20 to 900 AM Sunday May 21
IMPACTS...Several large wildfires are burning in Canada, resulting
in heavy smoke across several states including the eastern half of
Colorado. Although gradual improvement is expected to continue
across much of the advisory area, lingering health impacts will
remain possible through at least Sunday morning due to the recent
exposure to heavy smoke.
HEALTH INFORMATION...Public Health Recommendations: If smoke is
thick or becomes thick in your neighborhood you may want to remain
indoors. This is especially true for those with heart disease,
respiratory illnesses, the very young, and the elderly. Consider
limiting outdoor activity when moderate to heavy smoke is present.
Consider relocating temporarily if smoke is present indoors and is
making you ill. If visibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in
your neighborhood, smoke has reached levels that are unhealthy.</description>
