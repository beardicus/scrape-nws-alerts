<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues to be possible.
* WHERE...For the Yukon River, from the mouth of the Nowitna River
to Nulato, including Galena and Koyukuk
* WHEN...Through Sunday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of low lying areas along the Yukon River is now
occurring near the Nowitna River area. Water could rise very
rapidly as a surge of water and ice moves downstream. Fish camps
and cabins along the Yukon River from the mouth of the Nowitna
River to Nulato could become impacted by high water levels. Ruby
is not expected to flood due to their elevation above the river.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The ice jam 20 miles upriver from Ruby on the Yukon River
released at 7pm on Friday evening. A surge of water and ice
is now moving down the Yukon River. High water is expected to
reach Galena Saturday morning, during the day at Koyukuk and
by Saturday night at Nulato.

- If you live near or along the Yukon River between the Nowitna
and Koyukuk Rivers stay alert and be prepared to take action.</description>
<instruction>Those living in areas prone to flooding should prepare now for
possible ice jam flooding. Move valuables to higher ground and
prepare to evacuate on short notice. If flooding develops, water
will rise very fast.</instruction>
