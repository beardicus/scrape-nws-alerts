<headline>Hydrologic Outlook issued May 20 at 7:33PM ChST  by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL POSSIBLE TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY
MORNING...
This Hydrologic Outlook is for Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan in
the Mariana Islands.
Tropical Depression 02W continues to develop well south-southeast of
Guam/southwest of Chuuk. This system is forecast to continue to
strengthen over the next few days as it moves north-northwest toward
the Marianas. We have high confidence that a significant tropical
cyclone will move through the Marianas in the coming week. What
track it`ll take and at what strength remains to be seen, though
model variability is decreasing. Regardless of strength and track, a
very high likelihood for heavy rainfall exists.
Timing: Tuesday through Thursday
Locations: All of the Mariana Islands
Amounts: At least 6 to 10 inches of rainfall.
Note: Locally higher rainfall totals are likely, depending on storm
location.
Urban and Small Stream Flooding and/or Flash Flooding is possible
early next week as the system moves through the region.
Closely monitor this developing situation in the event watches,
advisories, or warnings are needed. Forecasts will change in the
coming days as this situation evolves.
Ensure nearby storm drains are not clogged, especially for low-
lying or flood-prone areas.</description>
