.NEW INFORMATION...
None.
.AREAS AFFECTED...
This local statement provides important information and
recommended actions for people in Guam, Rota Tinian and Saipan in
the Mariana Islands, Satawal in Yap State and Ulul and Polowat in
Chuuk State.
.Watches/Warnings...
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for the following locations,
Ulul and Polowat in western Chuuk State and Satawal in eastern Yap
State.
A Typhoon watch is in effect for the following locations, Guam,
Rota, Tinian, and Saipan in the Mariana Islands.
.STORM INFORMATION...
At 1 PM ChST...the center of Tropical Depression 02W was located
near Latitude 5.6N...Longitude 149.0E. This was about 610 miles
south-southeast of Guam. Storm Motion was north-northwest at 2 mph.
Storm Intensity was 30 mph.
.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
It is vital that you do not focus on the exact forecast track. To
do so could result in bad decisions and place you or those you
are responsible for at greater risk. TD 02W has formed over
western Chuuk State and is moving slowly north-northwest. 02W is
forecast to become a tropical storm this evening and possibly a
typhoon Sunday evening. It is too early to provide exact wind and
surge forecast values for specific locations. A general concern
should be for the possibility of at least extensive damage
somewhere within the Mariana Islands.
.PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
For those under a warning, preparations according to your typhoon
disaster plan should be well under way or complete. Remain in
shelter until the all clear is given by your local emergency
management authority.
For those under a watch, now is the time to begin preparing your
home or business according to your typhoon disaster plan. Listen
for possible warnings and be ready to evacuate if necessary. Heed
the advice of local officials and comply with any orders that are
issued.
For interests at ports, docks and marinas, it is recommended that
you perform the prescribed preparations according to your
emergency operations plan for tropical cyclones. If you live on a
boat, begin to safely secure your craft and make plans to leave
it for adequate land-based shelter. Listen for possible warnings.
Regarding the coastal waters under a watch, small craft should
return to port or seek safe harbor.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets
for official storm information. Listen for possible changes to
the forecast.
For additional precautionary and preparedness information, please
refer to the detailed recommendations relative to your location
as further described by your local National Weather Service office
and your local emergency management.
&amp;&amp;
.NEXT UPDATE...
The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather
Service in Tiyan around 9 PM...or sooner if conditions warrant.
...Typhoon Watch remains in effect...
...New Information...
None.
...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Stay calm and keep informed. Comply with any evacuation orders
that are issued for your area. If your home is vulnerable to high
winds, or you live in a surge zone or any location prone to
flooding, evacuate to a designated shelter or ride out the storm
in the sturdy home of family or friends.
Items to bring to a shelter include a first aid kit, medicines
and prescriptions, baby food and diapers, games and books,
toiletries, a battery powered radio, a cell phone, flashlights
with extra batteries, a blanket or sleeping bag for each person,
personal identification, copies of key papers such as insurance
policies, available cash and credit cards. Remember, pets are not
allowed in most public shelters, so check ahead with your intended
shelter.
Regarding your home or business, cover all windows and doors with
shutters or plywood. Move patio furniture and other loose objects
indoors. Brace all exterior doors, including garage doors. Do
this as early as possible.
If you need to make a trip to the hardware store, the grocery
store, or the gas station, do so as early as possible.
