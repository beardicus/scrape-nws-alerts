<headline>Air Quality Alert issued July 25 at 3:46PM CDT  by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN REMAINS EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM CDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has continued an
Air Quality Alert for ground-level ozone pollution. The Air
Quality Index (AQI) is expected to reach the Orange or Unhealthy
for Sensitive Groups category.
* WHERE...East central Minnesota.
* WHEN...Until 9 PM CDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Extreme heat can exacerbate the health impacts of air
quality. The general public may experience health effects with
prolonged outdoor exertion. Sensitive groups, such as people with
lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, children and
older adults, and people who are active outdoors, may experience
exasperated health effects with outdoor exertion.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Ground-level ozone is expected to be high
during the afternoon hours on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and
Thursday. Sunny skies, warm temperatures, and low humidity will
create an environment favorable for two types of pollutants
(Volatile Organic Compounds and Nitrogen Oxides) to react in the
air to produce ground-level ozone. Ozone will be highest during
the afternoon and early evening hours when sunshine is most
abundant, and temperatures are highest. Ozone will be low in the
morning, late evening, and overnight. Ozone levels are expected
to reach the orange air quality index (AQI) category, a level
considered unhealthy for sensitive groups, across central and
southern Minn.

<instruction>The health impacts of air quality are exacerbated by extreme
heat. Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease
(including asthma), heart disease, children and older adults, and
people who are active outdoors, should take extra precautions and
avoid outdoor exertion. The combination of heat and air quality
may impact some members general public during prolonged outdoor
exertion.
The general public should consider timing outdoor exertion during
the morning hours when both temperatures and ozone levels are the
lowest.
Reduce or eliminate activities that contribute to air pollution,
such as outdoor burning, and use of residential wood burning
devices. Reduce vehicle trips and vehicle idling as much as
possible.</instruction>
