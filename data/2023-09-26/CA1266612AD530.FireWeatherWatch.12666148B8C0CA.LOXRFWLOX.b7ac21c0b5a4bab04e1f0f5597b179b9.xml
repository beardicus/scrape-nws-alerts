<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 5 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO 9 AM

BARBARA COUNTY MOUNTAINS AS WELL AS THE SOUTH COAST...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH NOW IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY MORNING
THROUGH LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT FOR WIND AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY
FOR THE SANTA BARBARA COUNTY MOUNTAINS AS WELL AS THE SOUTH
COAST...
.A combination of moderately strong northerly pressure gradients,
weak cold advection, and increasing winds aloft will bring
critical fire weather conditions to the mountains of Santa
Barbara county as well as the South Coast this evening through
Wednesday morning with the possibility of the critical fire
weather conditions continuing through early Thursday morning.
Warm and dry conditions will occur in the foothills just above
Santa Barbara and Montecito both this evening and Wednesday
evening with temperatures from 75 to 85 degrees and humidity
lowering to 15 to 25 percent. Gusty north winds of 50 to 60 mph or
possibly higher could lead to rapid fire spread, especially in
the foothill areas. This part of Santa Barbara County is particularly
vulnerable to fires due to dry fuel moisture values at this time
of the year.
