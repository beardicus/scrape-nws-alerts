WEDNESDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH WEDNESDAY
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EDT
TONIGHT...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents
will occur. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of
up to 8 feet are expected in the surf zone. For the Coastal
Flood Warning, up to one foot of inundation above ground level
is expected in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways.
* WHERE...The coasts of Monmouth County and Ocean County in New
Jersey.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Wednesday
evening. For the High Surf Advisory, until 8:00 PM Wednesday.
For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until midnight tonight.
* IMPACTS...At this level, flooding begins on the most vulnerable
roads in coastal and bayside communities, and along inland
tidal waterways. Some partial or full road closures are
possible. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion are expected. Rip currents can sweep
even the best swimmers away from shore and into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Water levels will remain elevated through
the balance of the week, with minor or near minor tidal flooding
possible with the high tides on Wednesday evening and Thursday
evening.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
