<description>...WIND ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 AM PDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Northwest to north winds 25 to 35 mph with gusts of 45 to
55 mph expected. Isolated gusts of 55 to 60 mph possible in
wind-prone areas during the evening and overnight hours tonight
and Wednesday.
* WHERE...Santa Barbara County Southwestern Coast and Santa Ynez
Mountains Western Range.
* WHEN...Until 5 AM PDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Gusty winds will blow around unsecured objects and
make driving difficult, especially for high profile vehicles.
Tree limbs could be blown down and a few power outages may
result.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...These strong winds will combine with a
dry air mass to create elevated to potentially critical fire-
weather conditions. In addition, there will be periods of time
in the late morning and early afternoon each day when winds
temporarily subside, but then they will increase again before
sunset.</description>
<instruction>Use extra caution when driving, especially if operating a high
profile vehicle. Secure outdoor objects.</instruction>
