<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EDT WEDNESDAY
NIGHT...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH WEDNESDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, 1 to 2 feet of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways. For the Beach Hazards
Statement, there is a high risk of rip currents.
* WHERE...Eastern Currituck County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, until midnight EDT
Wednesday night. For the Beach Hazards Statement, through
Wednesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Widespread flooding of vulnerable areas will result
in an elevated threat of property damage to homes and
businesses near the waterfront and shoreline. Water will be 1
to 2 feet above ground level in some areas resulting in a
sufficient depth to close numerous roads and threaten homes
and businesses. Flooding will extend inland from the waterfront
along tidal rivers and bays resulting in some road closures and
flooding of vehicles. Large breaking waves of 6 to 7 ft will
result in dangerous surf conditions. Do not enter or approach
the water due to the risk of being swept away.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
