BARBARA COUNTY MOUNTAINS AS WELL AS THE SOUTH COAST...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH NOW IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY MORNING
THROUGH LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT FOR WIND AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY

COAST...
.Gusty northerly winds are expected across the mountains of
Santa Barbara county as well as the South Coast tonight through
Thursday morning. The strongest winds, gusts 30 to 50 mph with
possible gusts to 60 mph, are expected tonight through Wednesday
morning. These winds will combine with relative humidity in the
15 to 25 percent range this evening and again Wednesday evening
to bring critical fire weather conditions to these areas. The
confidence for widespread critical fire weather conditions is
high for tonight and Wednesday morning and a RED FLAG WARNING
is in effect. For Wednesday afternoon through Thursday morning,
confidence in widespread critical fire weather is not as high
and a FIRE WEATHER WATCH is in effect. These conditions could
lead to rapid fire spread, especially in the coastal foothills.
This part of Santa Barbara County is particularly vulnerable to
fires due to dry fuel moisture values at this time of the year.
