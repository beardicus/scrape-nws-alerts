<headline>Coastal Flood Statement issued September 26 at 5:50AM EDT until September 26 at 12:00PM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON EDT TODAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO
MIDNIGHT EDT TONIGHT...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Statement, up to one half foot of
inundation above ground level in vulnerable areas near the
waterfront and shoreline. For the High Rip Current Risk,
dangerous rip currents. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to
one and a half feet of inundation above ground level expected
in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...Southeast Suffolk County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Statement, until noon EDT today.
For the High Rip Current Risk, through this evening. For the
Coastal Flood Advisory, from 4 PM this afternoon to midnight
EDT tonight.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Localized brief minor flooding of the
most vulnerable locations near the waterfront and shoreline this
morning. Widespread minor flooding is expected in the most
vulnerable locations near the waterfront and shoreline late this
afternoon into this evening in low lying, vulnerable areas.
Some roads and low lying property including parking lots, parks,
lawns and homes/businesses with basements near the waterfront
will experience shallow flooding.
* BEACH EROSION AND FLOODING IMPACTS...Breaking waves of 4 to 6
ft will cause beach flooding and erosion, with scattered areas
of dune erosion during the time of high tide. The potential
for localized overwashes is low at this time, limited to the
most compromised dune areas.
* SWIMMING IMPACTS...Life-threatening rip currents are likely
for all people entering the surf zone. Anyone visiting the
beaches should stay out of the surf. Rip currents can sweep
even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
