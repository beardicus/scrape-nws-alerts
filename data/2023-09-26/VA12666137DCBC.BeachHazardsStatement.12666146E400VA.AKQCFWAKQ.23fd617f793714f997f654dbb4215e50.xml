* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, one to two feet of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways. For the Beach Hazards Statement, a high
risk of rip currents. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking
waves of 7 to 9 feet expected in the surf zone.

Wednesday to 6 AM EDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Widespread flooding of vulnerable areas will result in
an elevated threat of property damage to homes and businesses
near the waterfront and shoreline. Water will be 1 to 2 feet
above ground level in some areas resulting in a sufficient depth
to close numerous roads and threaten homes and businesses.
Flooding will extend inland from the waterfront along tidal
rivers and bays resulting in some road closures and flooding of
vehicles. Large breaking waves of 7 to 9 ft will result in
dangerous surf conditions. Do not enter or approach the water
due to the risk of being swept away.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
