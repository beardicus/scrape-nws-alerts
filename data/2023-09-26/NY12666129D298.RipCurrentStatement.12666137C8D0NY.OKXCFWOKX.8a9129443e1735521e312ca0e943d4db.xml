<headline>Rip Current Statement issued September 26 at 5:50AM EDT until September 26 at 9:00PM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM THIS
AFTERNOON TO MIDNIGHT EDT TONIGHT...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to 2 feet of inundation
above ground level expected in vulnerable areas near the
waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...Southern Queens County.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through this evening. For
the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 2 PM this afternoon to
midnight EDT tonight.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Widespread minor to locally moderate
flooding is expected in the most vulnerable locations near the
waterfront and shoreline. This will result in several road
closures and cause widespread flooding of low lying property
including parking lots, parks, lawns and homes/businesses with
basements near the waterfront. Vehicles parked in vulnerable
areas near the waterfront may become flooded.
* BEACH EROSION AND FLOODING IMPACTS...Breaking waves of 4 to 7
ft will cause beach flooding and erosion, with localized areas
of dune erosion possible during the time of high tide.
* SWIMMING IMPACTS...Life-threatening rip currents are likely
for all people entering the surf zone. Anyone visiting the
beaches should stay out of the surf. Rip currents can sweep
even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
