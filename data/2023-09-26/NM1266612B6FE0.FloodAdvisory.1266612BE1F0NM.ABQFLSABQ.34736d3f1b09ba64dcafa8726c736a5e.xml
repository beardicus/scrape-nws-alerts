<headline>Flood Advisory issued September 26 at 2:08PM MDT  by NWS Albuquerque</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM MDT THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Arroyo and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of southeast New Mexico, including extreme
southwest Chaves county. This will primarily impact the Four Mile
Draw and Walnut Draw.
* WHEN...Until 500 PM MDT.
* IMPACTS...Heavy rain from earlier storms upstream in Otero county
will lead to significant runoff into the Four Mile Draw and Walnut
Draw that feed into the Penasco River. Minor flooding in low-lying
and poor drainage areas is expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 200 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms upstream in Otero county. This will cause
runoff and eventually arroyo and small stream flooding into
extreme southwestern Chaves county. While not much rain is
currently falling in extreme southwestern Chaves county,
between 1 and 2 inches of rain have fallen upstream which
will eventually flow eastward.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Dunken and rural southwestern Chaves county.

<instruction>Arroyos, streams, and normally dry rivers can become raging killer
currents in a matter of minutes. Water in arroyos can travel many
miles and take hours to reach your location from upstream rain areas.</instruction>
