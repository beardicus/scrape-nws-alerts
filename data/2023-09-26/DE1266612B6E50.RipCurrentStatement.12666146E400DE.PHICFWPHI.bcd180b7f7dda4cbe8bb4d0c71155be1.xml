* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents
will occur. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of
up to 8 feet are expected in the surf zone. For the Coastal
Flood Warning, one to two feet of inundation above ground level
is expected in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways.
* WHERE...The coast of Sussex County Delaware.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Wednesday
evening. For the High Surf Advisory, until 8:00 PM Wednesday.
For the Coastal Flood Warning, until midnight tonight.
* IMPACTS...At this level, widespread roadway flooding occurs in
coastal and bayside communities and along inland tidal
waterways. Many roads become impassable. Some damage to
vulnerable structures may begin to occur. Dangerous swimming and
surfing conditions and localized beach erosion are expected.
Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore
and into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Water levels will remain elevated through
the balance of the week, with minor or near minor tidal flooding
possible with the high tides on Wednesday evening and Thursday
evening.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
