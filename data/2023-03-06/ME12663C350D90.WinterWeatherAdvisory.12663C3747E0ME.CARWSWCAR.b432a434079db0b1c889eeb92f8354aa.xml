<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued March 06 at 2:40AM EST until March 06 at 5:00PM EST by NWS Caribou</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM EST THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Snow and blowing snow. Additional snow accumulations 1 to 2
inches mainly across the far north. Winds gusting as high as 50
mph.
* WHERE...Northern Penobscot, Southeast Aroostook, Northeast
Aroostook, and Northwest Aroostook Counties.
* WHEN...Until 5 PM EST this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility in open areas and produce
snow drifts across roads. The hazardous conditions could impact
the Monday morning and evening commutes. Strong winds may cause
some damage to trees and power lines.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Weather Advisory for snow means periods of snow will cause
primarily travel difficulties. Expect snow covered roads and limited
visibilities, and use caution while driving.
