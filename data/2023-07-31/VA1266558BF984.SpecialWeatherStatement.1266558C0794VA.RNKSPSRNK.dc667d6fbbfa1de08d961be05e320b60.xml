south at 10 mph.
HAZARD...Winds in excess of 30 mph and pea size hail.

unsecured objects. Minor damage to outdoor objects is
possible.

and Westlake Corner.

<instruction>If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.
If on Smith Mountain Lake in this vicinity, move to shore
immediately. You do not want to be caught out on the lake during a
thunderstorm.
Locally heavy rain will quickly reduce visibility and result in
ponding of water on roadways, standing water in low lying areas, and
minor flooding of creeks, streams, and areas of poor drainage.
Drivers are urged to slow down and use extra caution to avoid
hydroplaning.</instruction>
