<headline>Flood Watch issued July 31 at 12:31PM AKDT  by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>.After further analysis from previous events and with no response
yet on the USGS Mendenhall Lake gauge we have extended the watch.
...FLOOD WATCH FOR A GLACIER-DAMMED LAKE OUTBURST NOW IN EFFECT
THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by a glacier-dammed lake outburst continues
to be possible.
* WHERE...The Mendenhall Lake and River, areas around the glacier
visitor center, the Mendenhall campground, Skaters Cabin Road,
View Drive and possibly below Back Loop bridge.
* WHEN...Through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of other
low-lying areas and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Latest webcam image from Suicide Basin shows water levels
dropping although Mendenhall Lake remains steady around 5.8
ft. It is possible that the drop in basin water levels was
caused from further melting of the ice dam and lowering the
water level in Suicide Basin.
Looking at previous release dates combined with current water
levels, best estimations show Mendenhall Lake could reach
moderate flood stage of around 11 ft by Thursday afternoon.
We continue to monitor the situation as more data comes
available.
- If you live near or along the Mendenhall Lake and River, stay
alert and be prepared to take action.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.
Stay tuned to further developments by listening to your local radio,
television, or NOAA Weather Radio for further information.</instruction>
