<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT CDT TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of central Missouri, including the following
areas, Boone MO, Callaway MO, Cole MO, Moniteau MO and Osage MO.
* WHEN...From Midnight CDT tonight through Tuesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.
Low-water crossings may be flooded. Storm drains and ditches may
become clogged with debris.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Repeated thunderstorms with high rain rates are likely to
produce a narrow corridor of heavy rain overnight tonight
through tomorrow morning across parts of the Watch area.
Rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches can be expected within this
corridor, with localized amounts as high as 6 inches possible
in very limited areas. Rainfall rates may exceed 2 inches per
hour within thunderstorms as well. While much of these areas
continue to observe drought conditions and dry soil, this
combination of rain rates and repeated thunderstorms may
produce significant runoff and flash flooding in a few
locations.</description>
