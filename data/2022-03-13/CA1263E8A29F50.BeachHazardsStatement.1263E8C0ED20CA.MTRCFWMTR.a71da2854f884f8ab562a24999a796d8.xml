<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued March 13 at 8:40PM PDT until March 15 at 7:00PM PDT by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>...Very long to long period west-northwest swell, sneaker waves
and strong rip currents from coastal Sonoma County to coastal
Monterey County 7 PM PDT Monday to 7 PM PDT Tuesday...
.Very long to long period west-northwest swell will develop from
coastal Sonoma County to coastal Monterey County Monday evening
and night resulting in a high risk of sneaker waves and strong rip
currents. Swell periods gradually decreasing Tuesday morning and
afternoon, however the risk of both strong rip currents and sneaker
waves will continue during the day. Swell heights and periods easing
Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning, thus by then the beach
hazards statement will likely be allowed to expire.
On days with high sneaker wave risk, the ocean can appear deceptively
calm with long lulls between larger wave sets. This may lead to
individuals venturing onto exposed coastal features where infrequent
but powerful waves can overwhelm them, knocking them into the cold,
restless ocean where the possibility of hypothermia or drowning is
severe. Each year, individuals lose their life during similar
sneaker wave events along the California coast. If visiting the
coast this weekend, respect the power of the ocean, remain vigilant
of your surroundings, and avoiding venturing onto exposed coastal
features where sudden, powerful waves can put your life at risk.
