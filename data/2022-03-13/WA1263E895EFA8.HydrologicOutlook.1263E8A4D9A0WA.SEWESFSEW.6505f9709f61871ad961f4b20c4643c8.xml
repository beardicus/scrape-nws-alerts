<description>...THREAT OF RIVER FLOODING SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY MORNING
FOR
MASON COUNTY...
An approaching  weather system will result in rain, heavy at times,
through Tuesday night with rises on rivers during this period.
The heaviest rain is expected to fall over the Olympics after
midnight tonight into Monday morning. Steady rainfall - diminishing
somewhat - will continue through Tuesday night.  Rainfall totals
over the Olympic Mountains tonight through Tuesday evening are
ranging from 3.5 to 5.5 inches. This could cause the Skokomish River
at Potlatch in Mason County to approach flood stage early Tuesday
morning.
Lower expected rainfall amounts for the Cascades has reduced the
potential for flooding on rivers flowing west of the Cascade
Mountains. Accordingly  the rivers of Snohomish, King, Pierce and
Lewis counties have been removed from the outlook.
Please monitor the latest river forecasts from the National Weather
Service for additional information.</description>
