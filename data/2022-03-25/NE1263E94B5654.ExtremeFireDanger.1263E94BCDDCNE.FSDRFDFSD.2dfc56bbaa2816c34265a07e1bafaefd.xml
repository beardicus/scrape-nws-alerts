<description>.DISCUSSION...
BUFKIT soundings indicate deep mixing across the area for today,
and this will allow strong winds and dry air to mix to the
surface. With winds at the top of the mixed layer running around
40 to 50 kts or stronger, there will be surface gusts of 40 to 50
mph across the area during the afternoon. As the drier air mixes
down, dew points will fall into the teens to lower 20s. Warmest
readings will occur through the James and MO River valleys with
highs in the lower to mid 50s, and this will yield afternoon RH
values of 15 to 25 percent - resulting in extreme fire danger
over those areas. To the east, temperatures will remain in the
40s, though the fire danger will be very high. The situation will
be monitored throughout the day, and appropriate changes made if
the driest air makes it farther to the east or temperatures warm
more than expected.
People are urged to exercise extreme care with respect to outdoor
activities that could cause grass fires. Avoid equipment that can
cause sparks near dry grass or brush. Do not toss cigarettes on
the ground. Report new fires quickly to the nearest fire
department or law enforcement office.
...EXTREME FIRE DANGER...
The Grassland Fire Danger Index will reach the extreme category
this afternoon. Extreme weather conditions and very low
moisture content of grasses, and other dry organic material
on the ground, indicate that critical burning conditions exist.
All fires have the potential to become large and spread quickly,
becoming erratic with extreme behavioral characteristics.
No outdoor burning should take place.
OUTLOOK FOR SATURDAY AFTERNOON...The Grassland Fire Danger Index
will reach the high category.
The grassland fire danger product reflects fire danger for native
grasses. It is not intended for cured agricultural crops, nor
will it reflect conditions in road ditches which have been mowed.</description>
