<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY MORNING
THROUGH MONDAY EVENING THROUGH MONDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions possible. Total snow accumulations
of up to 5 inches. Northwest winds 30 to 40 mph with gusts up
to 50 mph. Visibilities reduced to one quarter mile at times.
* WHERE...Eastern Aleutians.
* WHEN...From Sunday morning through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A low pressure system is expected to move
towards the Shumagin Islands on Sunday and then stall through
Monday. On the backside of this low, a tightening pressure
gradient resulting in gusty northwesterly winds in combination
with falling snow may result in blowing snow and periods of
reduced visibilities of one quarter mile Sunday morning through
Monday evening.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Watch for blizzard conditions means there is a
potential for falling and/or blowing snow with strong winds and
extremely poor visibilities. This can lead to whiteout conditions
and make travel very hazardous.</instruction>
