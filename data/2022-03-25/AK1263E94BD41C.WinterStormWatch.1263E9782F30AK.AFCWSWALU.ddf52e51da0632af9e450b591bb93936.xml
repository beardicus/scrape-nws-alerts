<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued March 25 at 4:31AM AKDT until March 27 at 7:00PM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH
SUNDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions possible. Total snow accumulations
of up to 2 inches. North winds 30 to 40 mph with gusts up to 50
mph. Visibilities reduced to one quarter mile at times.
* WHERE...Pribilof Islands.
* WHEN...From Sunday morning through Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Model guidance has shifted north and west
overnight and is showing a stronger solution for a low pressure
system that is expected to move northward towards the Shumagin
Islands on Sunday and then stall through Monday. On the backside
of this low, a tightening pressure gradient resulting in gusty
northwesterly winds in combination with falling snow as well as
cold air advection may result in blowing snow and periods of
reduced visibilities of one quarter mile on Sunday.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Watch for blizzard conditions means there is a
potential for falling and/or blowing snow with strong winds and
extremely poor visibilities. This can lead to whiteout conditions
and make travel very hazardous.</instruction>
