<description>...Active monsoon pattern to bring showers and thunderstorms and the
risk of flash flooding to much of central and eastern Nevada through
late this week...
Increasing monsoon moisture from southern Nevada and southwestern
Utah will bring an areal expansion of showers and thunderstorms to
portions of central and eastern Nevada through midweek. Wednesday is
expected to bring the more widespread showers and thunderstorms to
southeastern Elko county including the Ruby Mountains, White Pine
county and northeastern Nye county. Isolated flash flooding from
heavier thunderstorms is a the primary concern over the next several
days but especially Wednesday. Isolated rain amounts of 0.5 to 0.75
inches are possible with the heaviest thunderstorms, accumulating
over a relatively short time of an hour or less during the afternoon
and early evening hours.
Some potential impacts include flash flooding of normally dry
streams and arroyos as well as ponding water on roadways or
water-covered roadways which would affect travel.
Continue to monitor conditions closely and stay tuned for the
latest  forecasts, watches, and potential warnings.</description>
