<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR A GLACIER-DAMMED LAKE OUTBURST REMAINS IN EFFECT
THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by a glacier-dammed lake outburst continues
to be possible.
* WHERE...The Mendenhall Lake and River, areas around the glacier
visitor center, the Mendenhall campground, Skaters Cabin Road,
View Drive and possibly below Back Loop bridge.
* WHEN...Through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...This situation may result in flooding of other low-lying
areas and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The 8 AM Tuesday webcam image shows Suicide Basin continues
to drain slowly. However, Mendenhall Lake has not drastically
responded to the additional inflow of water other than from
heavy rain that occurred throughout Tuesday morning.
Over time, a path may form for the basin to drain at an
accelerated rate. Looking at previous release dates combined
with current water levels, best estimations show Mendenhall
Lake could exceed moderate flood stage. We continue to
monitor the situation and will update this statement with the
latest information available.
- If you live near or along the Mendenhall Lake and River, stay
alert and be prepared to take action.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.
Stay tuned to further developments by listening to your local radio,
television, or NOAA Weather Radio for further information.</instruction>
