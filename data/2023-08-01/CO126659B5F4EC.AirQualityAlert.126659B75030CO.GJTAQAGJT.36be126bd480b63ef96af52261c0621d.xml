<description>...AIR QUALITY HEALTH ADVISORY FOR WILDFIRE SMOKE FROM 900 AM
MONDAY UNTIL 900 AM TUESDAY...
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has
issued the following...
WHAT...Air Quality Health Advisory for Wildfire Smoke.
WHERE...central Gunnison County. Locations include, but are not
limited to Gunnison.
WHEN...900 AM Monday July 31 to 900 AM Tuesday August 01
IMPACTS...The Lowline wildfire is located in central Gunnison
County approximately 10 miles southwest of Crested Butte and 14
miles northwest of Gunnison. Moderate to heavy smoke is possible
early Monday morning from the fire, southward along County Road
730 to Gunnison. Smoke in these areas should decrease by late
Monday morning as atmospheric mixing increases. By Monday
afternoon, showers and thunderstorms with gusty, erratic winds
could send smoke in any direction. Late Monday night and into
Tuesday morning, smoke could again get heavy as it drains eastward
towards County Road 730 and southward into Gunnison.
HEALTH INFORMATION...Public Health Recommendations: If smoke is
thick or becomes thick in your neighborhood you may want to remain
indoors. This is especially true for those with heart disease,
respiratory illnesses, the very young, and the elderly. Consider
limiting outdoor activity when moderate to heavy smoke is present.
Consider relocating temporarily if smoke is present indoors and is
making you ill. If visibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in
your neighborhood, smoke has reached levels that are unhealthy.</description>
