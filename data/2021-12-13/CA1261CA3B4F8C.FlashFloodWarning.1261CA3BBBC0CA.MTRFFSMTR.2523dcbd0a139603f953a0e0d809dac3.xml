<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued December 13 at 5:23PM PST until December 13 at 8:00PM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING FOR THE DOLAN, CARMEL, RIVER, WILLOW BURN
AREA REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM PST THIS EVENING FOR SOUTHWESTERN
MONTEREY COUNTY...
At 523 PM PST, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated
heavy rain falling over the Dolan, Carmel, River, and Willow Burn
Areas. Between 2 and 3 inches of rain have fallen. Additional
rainfall amounts of 2 to 3 inches are possible in the warned area.
Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn areas will result in debris flow
moving through the Dolan, Carmel, River, and Willow Fire burn areas.
The debris flow can consist of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose
materials.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Heavy rain producing
flash flooding in and around the Dolan, Carmel, River,
and Willow Burn Areas.
SOURCE...Radar and automated gauges.
IMPACT...Life threatening flash flooding of areas in and around
the Dolan, Carmel, River, and Willow Burn Areas.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Tassajara Hot Springs, Lucia, Carmel Valley, Esalen Institute and
Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR AND GAUGE INDICATED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>This is a life threatening situation. Heavy rainfall will cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks...streams...and
ditches in the Dolan, Carmel, River, and Willow Burn Areas. Severe
debris flows can also be anticipated across roads. Roads and
driveways may be washed away in places. If you encounter flood
waters...climb to safety.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.</instruction>
