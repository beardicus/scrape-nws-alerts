<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued December 13 at 1:33PM MST until December 15 at 5:00PM MST by NWS Albuquerque</headline>
<description>...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM TO 5 PM WEDNESDAY FOR
THE NORTHEASTERN PLAINS DUE TO VERY STRONG WINDS, AND LOW
HUMIDITY...
.A very strong and fast moving storm system will quickly pass over
New Mexico Wednesday providing incredibly strong wind speeds
across eastern NM. Peak surface winds of 35 to 50 mph with gusts
to 70 mph are possible through the northeastern plains Wednesday
afternoon. Although temperatures will sharply fall, very dry air
will still cause humidity to fall to the low teens during the
afternoon. These conditions will allow any fire starts to quickly
grow out of control where fuels exist.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY MORNING THROUGH
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...
The National Weather Service in Albuquerque has issued a Fire
Weather Watch...which is in effect from Wednesday morning through
Wednesday afternoon.
* AREA AND TIMING...Northeast Plains
* 20 FOOT WINDS...Southwest 30 to 40 mph becoming west at 40 to 50
mph in the afternoon.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...10 to 15 percent
* IMPACTS...Any fires that develop will spread rapidly. Outdoor
burning is not recommended.</description>
