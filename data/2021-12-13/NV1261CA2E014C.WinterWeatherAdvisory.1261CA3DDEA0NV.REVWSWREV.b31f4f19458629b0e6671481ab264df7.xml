<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 10 PM THIS EVENING TO
10 AM PST TUESDAY...
* CHANGES...New area added to advisory.
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 4 inches,
except 4 to 10 inches above 5000 feet. Winds gusting as high as
45 mph.
* WHERE...Western Nevada Basin and Range including Pyramid Lake.
* WHEN...From 10 PM this evening to 10 AM PST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could become very difficult, with a sharp drop
in snow levels and visibility most likely tonight between 10 pm
and 1 am, with slick roads through the Tuesday morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...</description>
<instruction>Even light snowfall causes major travel delays, especially during
periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to
reach your destination. Leave extra space between vehicles since
it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
