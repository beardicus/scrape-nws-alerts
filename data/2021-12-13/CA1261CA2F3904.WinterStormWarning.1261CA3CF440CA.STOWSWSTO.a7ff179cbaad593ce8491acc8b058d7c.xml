<description>...Dangerous Winter Storm to Produce Very Heavy Snow with Strong
Winds and Whiteout Conditions...

mountains of northern California. Moderate to heavy snow showers
will continue into tomorrow. Snow levels will gradually lower over
time through late tonight and Tuesday. Expect tremendous snow
accumulation at pass levels with yardsticks required for snow
measurement. This will result in significant travel delays with
extremely difficult to impossible travel over the mountains.
Strong winds will further reduce visibilities during this event
with whiteout conditions.

TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow occurring. Travel will be very difficult to
impossible. Additional snow accumulations of 2 to 6 inches,

expected.
* WHERE...Shasta Lake Area / Northern Shasta County and
Mountains Southwestern Shasta County to Western Colusa County
including portions of Interstate 5 north of Redding and
Highway 299.
* WHEN...Until 4 AM Tuesday.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow level down to 1,500 feet at times.
Be prepared for significant reductions in visibility at times
with white-out conditions.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
A Winter Storm Warning for snow means there will be snow covered
roads and limited visibilities. Travel is not recommended while
the warning is in effect. If you must travel, keep an extra
flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case of an
emergency.The latest road conditions for the state you are
