<description>...PERIODS OF HEAVY MOUNTAIN SNOW THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON, WITH
LOW SNOW SNOW LEVELS AND LINGERING SNOW SHOWERS TONIGHT...
Precipitation will become steadier and heavier this morning ahead
of a cold front, resulting in heavy mountain snow along the
highest portions of highway 36 and highway 3 in Trinity County.
Snow levels will begin lowering by mid-morning, eventually dropping
below 2000 feet in Humboldt and Del Norte Counties later this
afternoon. That will allow for heavy snow around Berry Summit and
near the Collier Tunnel. Precipitation coverage and intensity
will diminish greatly heading into this evening. However, some
scattered showers will linger through the night into early Tuesday
morning, as snow levels will continue to fall. Some minor
accumulations will be possible at elevations as low as 1,000 feet
by Tuesday morning, with some accumulations possible at some of
the highway summits through Mendocino and Lake County.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST THIS
EVENING ABOVE 3000 FEET...
* WHAT...Heavy snow above 3000 feet. Additional snow accumulations
of 6 to 12 inches possible along the higher elevation portions
of Highway 3 and 36, with 14 to 20 inches at Scott Mountain
Summit. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...Southern Trinity and Northern Trinity Counties.
* WHEN...Until 10 PM PST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible along
high elevation portions of Highways 3 and 36, with slippery,
snow-covered roads and poor visibility.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
