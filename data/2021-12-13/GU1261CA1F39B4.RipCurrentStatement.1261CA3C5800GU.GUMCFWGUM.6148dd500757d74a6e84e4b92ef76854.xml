<headline>Rip Current Statement issued December 13 at 3:17AM ChST until December 14 at 6:00PM ChST by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM TUESDAY ALONG
NORTH AND EAST FACING REEFS...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT ALONG NORTH AND EAST
FACING REEFS THROUGH TUESDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Large breaking waves of 9 to 12 feet and dangerous rip
currents.
* WHERE...North and east facing reefs of the Marianas.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 6 AM Tuesday. For the High
Rip Current Risk, through Tuesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Large north and east swell are expected to
slowly subside beginning today. Surf along east facing reefs could
fall below hazardous levels of 12 feet sometime today, with surf
along north facing reefs possibly falling below hazardous levels of
9 feet tonight. East swell may take a little longer to subside, and
as such, a high rip current risk may extend past Tuesday afternoon,
possibly lasting through Wednesday afternoon.</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should stay out of the water along north and
east facing shores. Elsewhere, swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a
rip current, swim in a direction following the shoreline until you
are out of the current, then head in to shore.</instruction>
