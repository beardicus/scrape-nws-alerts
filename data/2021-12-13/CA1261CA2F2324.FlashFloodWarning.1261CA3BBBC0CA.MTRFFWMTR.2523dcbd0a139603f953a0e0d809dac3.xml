The Dolan, Carmel, River, Willow burn area in...
Southwestern Monterey County in central California...

Areas. Between 2 and 3 inches of rain have fallen. Additional
rainfall amounts of 2 to 3 inches are possible in the warned area.
Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.

materials.

flash flooding in and around the Dolan, Carmel, River,
and Willow Burn Areas.

the Dolan, Carmel, River, and Willow Burn Areas.

Tassajara Hot Springs, Lucia, Carmel Valley, Esalen Institute and

FLASH FLOOD...RADAR AND GAUGE INDICATED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>This is a life threatening situation. Heavy rainfall will cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks...streams...and
ditches in the Dolan, Carmel, River, and Willow Burn Areas. Severe
debris flows can also be anticipated across roads. Roads and
driveways may be washed away in places. If you encounter flood
waters...climb to safety.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.</instruction>
