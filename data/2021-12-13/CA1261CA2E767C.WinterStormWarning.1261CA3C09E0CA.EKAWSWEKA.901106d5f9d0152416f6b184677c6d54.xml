<description>...PERIODS OF HEAVY MOUNTAIN SNOW THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON, WITH
LOW SNOW SNOW LEVELS AND LINGERING SNOW SHOWERS TONIGHT...
Precipitation will become steadier and heavier this morning ahead
of a cold front, resulting in heavy mountain snow along the
highest portions of highway 36 and highway 3 in Trinity County.
Snow levels will begin lowering by mid-morning, eventually
dropping below 2000 feet in Humboldt and Del Norte Counties this
afternoon. That will allow for heavy snow around Berry Summit and
near the Collier Tunnel. Precipitation coverage and intensity
will diminish greatly heading into this evening. However, some
scattered showers will linger through the night into early Tuesday
morning, as snow levels will continue to fall. Some minor
accumulations will be possible at elevations as low as 1,000 feet
by Tuesday morning, which includes the highway summits through
Mendocino and Lake County.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST THIS
EVENING ABOVE 1500 FEET...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected above 1500 feet. Total snow
accumulations of 6 to 12 inches possible at Berry Summit and
the Collier Tunnel.
* WHERE...Del Norte Interior, Northern Humboldt Interior and
Southern Humboldt Interior Counties.
* WHEN...From 10 AM this morning to 10 PM PST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult along Highway 299
near Berry Summit and on Highway 199 at the Collier Tunnel,
with slippery, snow- covered road conditions and poor
visibility. Some high elevation rural roadways may become
impassable.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow levels will fall through the day to
around 1500 feet by late afternoon or evening.</description>
