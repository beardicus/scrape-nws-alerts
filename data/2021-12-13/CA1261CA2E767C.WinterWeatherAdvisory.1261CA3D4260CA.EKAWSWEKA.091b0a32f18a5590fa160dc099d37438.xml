<description>...PERIODS OF HEAVY MOUNTAIN SNOW THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON, WITH
LOW SNOW SNOW LEVELS AND LINGERING SNOW SHOWERS TONIGHT...
Precipitation will become steadier and heavier this morning ahead
of a cold front, resulting in heavy mountain snow along the
highest portions of highway 36 and highway 3 in Trinity County.
Snow levels will begin lowering by mid-morning, eventually
dropping below 2000 feet in Humboldt and Del Norte Counties this
afternoon. That will allow for heavy snow around Berry Summit and
near the Collier Tunnel. Precipitation coverage and intensity
will diminish greatly heading into this evening. However, some
scattered showers will linger through the night into early Tuesday
morning, as snow levels will continue to fall. Some minor
accumulations will be possible at elevations as low as 1,000 feet
by Tuesday morning, which includes the highway summits through
Mendocino and Lake County.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM THIS
AFTERNOON TO 6 AM PST TUESDAY ABOVE 1500 FEET...
* WHAT...Snow expected above 1500 feet. Total snow accumulations
of 1 to 4 inches. Some minor accumulations possible down to
1000 feet.
* WHERE...Northeastern Mendocino Interior, Southeastern
Mendocino Interior, Northwestern Mendocino Interior, Northern
Lake and Southern Lake Counties.
* WHEN...From 4 PM this afternoon to 6 AM PST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be difficult tonight into early Tuesday
morning, with slippery, snow- covered roads possible at the
higher elevation summits of Highway 101, and portions of
Highway 20 and 175.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow levels will fall through the afternoon
and overnight as the rain becomes more showery and tapers off.</description>
