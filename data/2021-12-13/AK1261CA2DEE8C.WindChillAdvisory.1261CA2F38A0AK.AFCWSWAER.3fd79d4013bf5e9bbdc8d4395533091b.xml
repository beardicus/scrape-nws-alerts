<description>...WIND CHILL ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM AKST THIS
AFTERNOON FOR THOMPSON PASS...
* WHAT...Very cold wind chills. Wind chills as low as 50 below
zero.
* WHERE...Thompson Pass.
* WHEN...Until 1 PM AKST Monday.
* IMPACTS...The dangerously cold wind chills could cause
frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Northeasterly winds of 35 to 50 mph will
continue this morning before diminishing by early afternoon. The
combination of strong winds and temperatures falling to between
5 and 15 below zero will keep wind chill values between 40 and
50 below zero through Thompson Pass. As the winds diminish this
afternoon, some light snow appears likely. There will still be
enough wind to create blowing snow concerns, so motorists should
use caution and stay aware of the forecast.</description>
<instruction>Use caution while traveling outside. Wear appropriate clothing, a
hat, and gloves.</instruction>
