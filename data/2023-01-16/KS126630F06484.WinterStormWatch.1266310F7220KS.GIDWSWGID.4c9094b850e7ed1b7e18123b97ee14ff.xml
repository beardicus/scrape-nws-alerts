<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 16 at 8:49PM CST until January 19 at 12:00AM CST by NWS Hastings</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE TUESDAY NIGHT
THROUGH WEDNESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation possible. Significant
variation in snow amounts, ranging from as much as 4 to 8 inches
near and north of Highway 6 in Nebraska, to as little as 1 to 3
inches in north central Kansas. Where snow amounts will be
lower, freezing rain could produce ice accumulation up to around
one tenth of an inch, especially southeast of a line from York,
to Red Cloud, to Smith Center. Winds will average 15 to 20 MPH
with gusts to around 30 MPH, initially out of the northeast but
then turning northwesterly Wednesday night.
* WHERE...Portions of north central Kansas and central and south
central Nebraska, including the Tri Cities.
* WHEN...From late Tuesday night through Wednesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous
conditions may develop in time to impact the Wednesday morning
commute, but there is greater confidence in impacts to the
Wednesday evening commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Please expect at least minor adjustments
to later snowfall forecasts, as confidence levels in snow
amounts at any given location is currently considered only
medium. This is due to continued uncertainty in the exact storm
track, and the location of a likely sharp transition from heavy
snow to wintry mix.</description>
