<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued January 16 at 2:42AM PST until January 16 at 12:00PM PST by NWS Seattle</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 7 AM THIS MORNING TO
NOON PST TODAY...
* WHAT...Minor coastal flooding expected.
* WHERE...San Juan County zone.
* WHEN...From 7 AM this morning to noon PST today.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...While weaker than yesterday, low pressure
offshore will enhance tidal anomalies up to a foot above
predicted anomalies. This could lead to minor tidal overflow
across the San Juan Islands. High tides look to decrease,
though remain close to advisory levels Tuesday.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
