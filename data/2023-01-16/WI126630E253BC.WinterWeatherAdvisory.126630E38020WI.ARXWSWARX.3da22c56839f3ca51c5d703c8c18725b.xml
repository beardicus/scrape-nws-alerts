<description>...Slippery Travel Still Possible This Morning...
.Confidence has decreased for widespread ice accumulations across
the county as overnight temperatures have held steady just above
freezing by a degree or two. However, cannot rule out a light
glaze of ice in the far north-northeast portion of the county
where temperatures remain near freezing. A difference in
temperatures by a couple degrees would have big implications on
total icing accumulations. Check road conditions before heading
out this morning. Although icing amounts may be minor, untreated
roads and sidewalks would be slippery for the morning commute.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST
TODAY...
* WHAT...Freezing rain. Ice accumulations of a light glaze up to
one tenth of an inch for the far northeast portion of the
county.
* WHERE...Taylor County.
* WHEN...Until noon CST today.
* IMPACTS...Very slippery sidewalks, roads and bridges are
possible. The slippery conditions could impact the morning
commute.</description>
