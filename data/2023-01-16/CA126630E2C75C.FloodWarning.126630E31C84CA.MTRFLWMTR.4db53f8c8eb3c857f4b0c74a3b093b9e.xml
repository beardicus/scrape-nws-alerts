<headline>Flood Warning issued January 16 at 5:27AM PST  by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>.Excessive runoff from the heavy rain overnight continues to cause
rises on local creeks, including Alameda Creek.
...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 745 AM PST THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...Alameda Creek near Niles in Alameda county north of
Fremont and east of Union City.
* WHEN...Until 745 AM PST.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring. Streams
continue to rise due to excess runoff from earlier rainfall. It
will take several hours for all the water from these storms to
work through local drainage systems in urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 527 AM PST, River gauge report on Alameda Creek near Niles
continues to show rising levels. At 4:45 am, the gauge had
risen to 10.4 ft. Additional rises are likely as light
showers and runoff continue in the area for the next couple
of hours. Moderate flood stage at this gauge starts at 10.5
ft so moderate flooding is expected to begin shortly in the
warned area. Between 0.75 and 2 inches of rain has fallen in
the past 12 hours.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Niles Canyon Rd north of Mission Blvd and Vallejo Mill Park.

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.</instruction>
