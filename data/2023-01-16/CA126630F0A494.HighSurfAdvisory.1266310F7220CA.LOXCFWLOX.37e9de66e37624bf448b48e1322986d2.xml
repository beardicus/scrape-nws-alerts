<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST
WEDNESDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding.
For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 8 to 12 feet,
decreasing to 6 to 8 feet Tuesday afternoon. Dangerous rip
currents are also expected.
* WHERE...Ventura County Beaches.
* WHEN...Until 10 PM PST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely, around the time of
high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as
parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to roads
or structures is NOT expected. There is an increased risk of
ocean drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers and surfers out
to sea. Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off
beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Minor coastal flooding is possible around
the time of high tide, causing inundation of sea water in low
lying coastal areas and minor beach erosion. For Ventura County
beaches, high tides will be 5.4 feet at 453 AM on Tuesday, and
near 6.7 feet around 6 AM on Wednesday. Even higher tides are
forecast for Thursday through Monday with tides 7.4 feet or
higher, peaking Friday through Sunday near 7.8 feet between 730
AM to 900 AM. Coastal flooding is likely to persist through
early next week.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
