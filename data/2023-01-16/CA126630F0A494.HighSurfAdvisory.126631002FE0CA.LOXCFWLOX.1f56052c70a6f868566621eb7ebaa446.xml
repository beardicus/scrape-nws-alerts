<headline>High Surf Advisory issued January 16 at 8:13PM PST until January 17 at 10:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST
WEDNESDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST TUESDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding.
For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 4 to 7 feet
on west facing beaches, except 7 to 10 feet on the southwest
coast near Jalama. Dangerous rip currents are also expected.
* WHERE...Santa Barbara County Southwestern Coast and Santa
Barbara County Southeastern Coast.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 10 PM PST
Wednesday. For the High Surf Advisory, until 10 PM PST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely, around the time of
high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as
parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to roads
or structures is NOT expected. There is an increased risk of
ocean drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers and surfers out
to sea. Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off
beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Minor coastal flooding is possible around
the time of high tide, causing inundation of sea water in low
lying coastal areas and minor beach erosion. High tides will be
6.3 feet at 508 AM on Tuesday, and near 7 feet at 6 AM on
Wednesday. Even higher tides are forecast for Thursday through
Monday with tides 7.4 feet or higher, peaking Friday through
Sunday near 7.8 feet between 730 AM to 930 AM. Coastal
flooding is likely to persist through early next week.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
