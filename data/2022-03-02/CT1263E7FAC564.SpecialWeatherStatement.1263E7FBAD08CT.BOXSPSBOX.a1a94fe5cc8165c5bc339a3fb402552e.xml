<description>...SLIPPERY TRAVEL POSSIBLE EARLY THURSDAY MORNING...
A period of snow will overspread interior Massachusetts between
midnight and 2 AM. Precipitation will likely be in the form of
mainly rain along the south coast, with a mix of snow and rain
across northern CT into RI and southeast Massachusetts, then
ending as a period of snow toward daybreak Thursday. The steadiest
snow, perhaps moderate for a time will occur between 2 and 5 AM,
then tapering off from west to east.
Snow accumulations will be minor, a coating to an inch across
northern Massachusetts, including the Greater Boston area and
possibly southward into northern RI and CT. There is a low
probability of a few locations receiving up to two inches.
This may be sufficient for roads, especially untreated and secondary
roads to become snow covered, mainly across the hilly terrain of
northern Massachusetts, including the Mass Pike corridor and
possibly the hilly terrain of northern CT and northwest RI. In
addition, as the precipitation tapers off, temperatures will fall
below freezing across this region, with any residual road
moisture or slush freezing, possibly resulting in slippery travel
for the morning commute.</description>
