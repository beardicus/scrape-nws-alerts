<description>...Another Atmospheric River arrives Wednesday with heavy rain
leading to likely flooding in southern Humboldt, southern Trinity,
Mendocino, and Lake Counties...
* WHAT...A weak weather system on Monday will bring light rain and
mountain snow to the region with generally 0.20-0.40 of liquid
equivalent precipitation expected. Elevations as low as 2000 feet
could see snow accumulations of 2 to 5 inches. Another system may
bring additional very light rain on Tuesday. No flooding is
anticipated through Tuesday, but this rain will keep soils
saturated. A much more potent storm system will arrive on
Wednesday as another atmospheric river impacts the region. This
system will likely target the heaviest rainfall across the
southern half of the forecast area in southern Humboldt, southern
Trinity, Mendocino, and Lake Counties. Widespread rain of 2 to 4
inches is currently forecast with higher amounts in some of the
favored terrain. This will once again bring the potential for
small stream and main stem river flooding with saturated soils
across the region. The California Nevada River Forecast Center is
indicating the potential for the Navarro River and Russian River
at Hopland both to approach or exceed flood stage while the Mad
River and Eel River at Fernbridge are also predicted to reach
Monitor Stage. Additional rainfall is expected beyond Thursday as
more systems impact the region with the chance of additional
periods of heavy rainfall into early next week.
* WHERE...The heaviest rainfall is expected to occur over southern
Humboldt, southern Trinity, Mendocino, and Lake Counties where
flooding is most likely.
* WHEN...Wednesday into Wednesday night will see the heaviest rain
with flood impacts likely lingering through Thursday. Long range
models suggest more chances for heavy rain into early next week.
