<description>...A WINTER STORM WILL BRING SIGNIFICANT MOUNTAIN SNOW TO WESTERN
AND NORTHERN NEW MEXICO TODAY THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...
.A vigorous low pressure system will approach New Mexico today and
pass over the Four Corners tonight before exiting into northeast
Colorado on Monday. The areas most likely to observe significant
snow in New Mexico will be the high elevations above 8,000 feet in
western and northern New Mexico where generally 6 to 12 inches of
fresh snow accumulations are possible. Lower elevation areas will
initially observe rainfall before changing to snow tonight. Locally
higher amounts above 10,000 feet are possible. Areas of reduced
visibility and snow-packed mountain roads are possible during this
time, and strong winds may create areas of blowing snow, further
reducing visibility. Snow levels will fall this evening when the
heaviest snow is expected. Periods of light to occasionally moderate
snow may continue through the day Monday.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM MST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 6 and 10
inches with locally higher amounts above 10,000 feet. Winds
gusting as high as 35 mph may create areas of blowing and drifting
snow.
* WHERE...Jemez Mountains, Tusas Mountains Including Chama, and
Southwest Mountains.
* WHEN...Until 5 PM MST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Tire traction will be
reduced. Consider making alternate travel plans or delaying travel.</description>
