<description>...LONG DURATION WINTER STORM FOR MOUNTAINS...SNOW AND MIXED
PRECIPITATION DEVELOPS OVER THE PLAINS THIS EVENING...
.A storm system will move into the Desert Southwest today and then
track to the Four Corners area late tonight. On Monday, it will move
across Colorado and then push into the Central Plains by Monday
night.  This track will support development of widespread snow, as
well as some light freezing precipitation across portions of the
plains.
In the mountains, scattered snow showers are expected this
afternoon. Snow will redevelop this evening and continue through
Monday and Monday evening before tapering off again late Monday
night. Hazardous and slow travel conditions can be expected during
this period.
Across the foothills, I-25 Corridor, and adjacent plains, areas of
snow will be developing this evening, with the most persistent snow
spreading to the northern border area through early Monday morning.
Behind that, areas of light freezing drizzle or rain will be
possible, leading to icy road conditions. Precipitation will trend
to almost all snow by mid to late afternoon Monday, and there may be
an increase in snowfall rates as well especially on the northeastern
plains into Monday evening.  Travelers across the foothills and
plains will encounter hazardous travel conditions starting this
evening and continuing through Monday and Monday evening.
