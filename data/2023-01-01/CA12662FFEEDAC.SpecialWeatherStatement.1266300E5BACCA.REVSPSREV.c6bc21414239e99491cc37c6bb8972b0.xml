<description>...Fast Moving Storm Late Monday Followed by a Bigger Storm
Midweek...
A couple of storm systems are on the docket for the first week of
2023 with additional storms likely into the second week. For this
week: A weak storm will bring light snow accumulations to all
elevations from late Monday afternoon through daybreak Tuesday. A
stronger storm will then bring gusty winds late Wednesday with
another round of heavy wet Sierra snow and mixture of rain and
snow to lower elevations Wednesday night and Thursday.
FIRST STORM MONDAY PM-TUESDAY AM:
* Snow levels with the first storm will be down to all valley
floors. Snowfall amounts will be light, generally 5 to 10 inches
along the Sierra crest, 2 to 5 inches in the Tahoe Basin and up
to 2 inches elsewhere. Current projections have the snow
starting around the Monday evening commute with most of the
snowfall occurring through the evening hours. Prepare for slick
roads, especially once the sun sets on Monday.
SECOND STRONGER STORM WEDNESDAY PM-THURSDAY:
* A second and much stronger storm will approach Wednesday with a
cold front swinging through the Sierra and western NV Wednesday
night and Thursday morning. Winds across ridges will increase
Wednesday afternoon and peak overnight with gusts approaching
100 mph. Winds down on the valley floors do not look too strong
but typical windprone areas along Highway 395 and Highway 95
near Walker Lake could experience a short duration of impactful
winds.
* As far as precipitation, the orientation of this storm is not
favorable for spillover initially. Snow will begin in the Sierra
Wednesday afternoon and evening with light rain and snow showers
spilling into far western NV at times. Travel impacts during
this part of the storm will mostly be felt at the passes and
roads heading to areas west of the crest. As the cold front
moves through Wednesday night into Thursday morning, rain and
snow will be at its heaviest and will spill over into western
NV. At the same time snow levels will be falling from around
lake level to all valley floors. This part of the storm could
bring widespread travel impacts. Total snow projections for
this storm range from 2 to 3 feet along the crest and 5 to 10
inches for the Tahoe Basin and foothills of the eastern Sierra
to several inches on valley floors.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS: If you have travel plans
through the Sierra, prepare for winter weather driving conditions
ahead of time and try to avoid the worst conditions. There will
likely be periods of snow and icy roads even on the valley floors
at times this week and possible next week as well as additional
storms arrive.</description>
