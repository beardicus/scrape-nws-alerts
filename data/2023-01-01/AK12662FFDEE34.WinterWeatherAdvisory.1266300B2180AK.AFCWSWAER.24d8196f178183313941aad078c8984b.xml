<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 01 at 4:49AM AKST until January 01 at 3:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 PM AKST THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Heavy snow transitioning to mixed precipitation. Snow
accumulations of 6 to 15 inches. Winds gusting as high as 60
mph through the northern portions of Turnagain Pass.
* WHERE...Seward Highway Corridor from the Sterling Highway
Cutoff through Turnagain Pass.
* WHEN...Until 3 PM AKST today.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be extremely hazardous.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Heavy snowfall rates of one to three inches
an hour are likely through the morning hours near Summit Lake
and Turnagain Pass. Snow levels will climb through this afternoon,
reaching between 1200 ft and 1500 ft (around the summit of
Turnagain Pass and Summit Lake). This will transition
precipitation from snow to a mix of rain and snow or heavy rain.
Mixed precipitation or heavy rain falling onto snow covered
roadways will create hazardous driving conditions. Depending on
the timing of the transition between rain and snow, snow totals
may be higher or lower. Heavy snow combined with strong winds,
mainly through the Turnagain Pass area, could significantly
reduce visibility.</description>
