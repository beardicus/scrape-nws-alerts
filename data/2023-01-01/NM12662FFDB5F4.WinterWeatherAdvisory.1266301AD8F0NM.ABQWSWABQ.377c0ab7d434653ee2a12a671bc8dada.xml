<description>...A WINTER STORM WILL BRING SIGNIFICANT MOUNTAIN SNOW TO WESTERN
AND NORTHERN NEW MEXICO TODAY THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...
.A vigorous low pressure system will approach New Mexico late this
morning and pass over the Four Corners tonight before exiting into
northeast Colorado on Monday. The areas most likely to observe
significant snow in New Mexico will be the high elevations above
8,000 feet in western and northern New Mexico where generally 6 to
12 inches of fresh snow accumulations are possible. Lower elevation
areas will initially observe rainfall before changing to snow
tonight. Locally higher amounts above 10,000 feet are possible.
Areas of reduced visibility and snow-packed mountain roads are
possible during this time, and strong winds may create areas of
blowing snow, further reducing visibility. Snow levels will fall
this evening when the heaviest snow is expected. Periods of light to
occasionally moderate snow may continue through the day Monday.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT FROM 5 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO
8 PM MST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 4 and 10
inches above 7500 feet with lesser amounts of 1 to 4 inches below.
Winds gusting as high as 55 mph may create areas of blowing and
drifting snow.
* WHERE...Northern and Southern Sangre de Cristo Mountains, and
South Central Mountains.
* WHEN...From 5 PM this afternoon to 8 PM MST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Tire chains may be
necessary if traveling through mountain passes. Strong winds could
cause extensive damage to trees and power lines.</description>
