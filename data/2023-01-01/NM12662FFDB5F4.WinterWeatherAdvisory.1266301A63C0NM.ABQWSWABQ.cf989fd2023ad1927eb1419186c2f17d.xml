<description>...A WINTER STORM WILL BRING SIGNIFICANT MOUNTAIN SNOW TO WESTERN
AND NORTHERN NEW MEXICO TODAY THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...
.A vigorous low pressure system will approach New Mexico late this
morning and pass over the Four Corners tonight before exiting into
northeast Colorado on Monday. The areas most likely to observe
significant snow in New Mexico will be the high elevations above
8,000 feet in western and northern New Mexico where generally 6 to
12 inches of fresh snow accumulations are possible. Lower elevation
areas will initially observe rainfall before changing to snow
tonight. Locally higher amounts above 10,000 feet are possible.
Areas of reduced visibility and snow-packed mountain roads are
possible during this time, and strong winds may create areas of
blowing snow, further reducing visibility. Snow levels will fall
this evening when the heaviest snow is expected. Periods of light to
occasionally moderate snow may continue through the day Monday.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM THIS MORNING TO
5 PM MST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 2 and 6
inches below 7,500 feet with higher amounts of 4 to 8 inches
above. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph may create areas of blowing
and drifting snow in the colder high elevations.
* WHERE...Far Northwest Highlands, Chuska Mountains, San Francisco
River Valley, West Central Mountains, and West Central Plateau.
* WHEN...From 11 AM this morning to 5 PM MST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Tire traction will be
reduced. Extend the distance between your vehicle and the vehicle
in front of you. This includes along portions of I-40. The
hazardous conditions could impact the Monday morning and evening
commutes.</description>
