<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 01 at 4:44PM CST until January 03 at 12:00PM CST by NWS Hastings</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM MONDAY TO
NOON CST TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow accumulations
of up to two inches and ice accumulations of up to one tenth
of an inch.
* WHERE...In Kansas, Phillips and Smith Counties. In Nebraska,
Fillmore, Webster and Nuckolls Counties.
* WHEN...From 6 PM Monday to noon CST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the Tuesday morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Areas of rain will develop across the
area Monday morning as temperatures hover just above freezing,
and remain there through the remainder of the daytime hours.
The greatest travel impacts will occur Monday night into
Tuesday morning due to falling temperatures and rain changing
to freezing rain and snow. The highest snow accumulations are
expected to be north of the Platte River, but an inch, or so,
will be possible as far south as the Nebraska, Kansas state
line. Exact storm track remains somewhat uncertain, and only a
couple of degrees warmer or colder will have immense influence
on local impacts. Stay tuned for updated information!.</description>
