<description>...SNOW CONTINUES IN THE MOUNTAINS WITH SNOW AND FREEZING DRIZZLE
DEVELOPING OVER THE PLAINS TONIGHT...
.A storm system over the Desert Southwest will track to the Four
Corners area late tonight. On Monday, it will move across Colorado
and then push into the Central Plains by Monday night. This track
will support development of widespread snow, as well as some
freezing drizzle across the Front Range and plains.
In the mountains, scattered snow showers are expected this evening.
Snow will redevelop overnight and continue through Monday and Monday
evening before tapering off Monday night. Hazardous and slow travel
conditions can be expected during this period.
Across the foothills, I-25 Corridor, and adjacent plains, areas of
snow and freezing drizzle will develop tonight. Snow shifts north of
the area late tonight. Behind that, areas of freezing drizzle will
be possible, leading to icy road conditions. Precipitation will
trend to almost all snow by mid to late afternoon Monday, and there
may be an increase in snowfall rates as well especially on the
northeastern plains into Monday evening. Travelers across the
foothills and plains will encounter hazardous travel conditions
starting tonight and continuing through Monday and Monday evening.
