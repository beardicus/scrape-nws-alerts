<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 01 at 6:19AM AKST until January 01 at 9:00AM AKST by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...Winter Weather Advisories Continue for Dyea as well as along
the Haines and Klondike Highways...
A warm front continues moving northward up Lynn Canal tonight and
has resulted in temperatures near sea level near Lynn Canal
warming to above the freezing mark. This has resulted in the
precipitation type for Haines and Skagway to begin changing to
rain. Further inland, away from the water, and at higher
elevations, cold temperatures still persist for Dyea, the
Klondike Highway, and out the road along the Haines Highway.
Additional snowfall for the upper parts of the highways will
continue through the early morning before diminishing.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM AKST THIS
MORNING...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 4 to 6
inches. Highest amounts near the border.
* WHERE...Haines Highway.
* WHEN...Until 9 AM AKST this morning.
* IMPACTS...Plan on reduced visibility and slippery road
conditions on the Haines Highway through morning.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Heaviest snowfall rates are expected
after midnight near the border. Near Haines and Lynn Canal, a
wintry mix has already changed over to all rain.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling. If you must travel,
