<description>...Freezing Rain And Snow Late Monday Into Tuesday...
.A winter storm will spread mixed precipitation across the Upper
Midwest from later Monday into Tuesday. A mix of snow and
freezing rain is anticipated in parts of northwest and north
central Iowa, with a potential for significant ice accumulations
by Monday night and light snow lingering on Tuesday. Significant
uncertainty remains in the advisory area in terms of icing
accumulations, as a shift in the system could greatly alter ice
amounts. Travel impacts are likely during this time frame, in
addition to power outages.
...ICE STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM MONDAY TO 6 PM CST
TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Significant icing expected. Ice accumulations of one
quarter to four tenths of an inch. Winds gusting as high as 35
mph.
* WHERE...Northwestern Iowa.
* WHEN...From 6 PM Monday to 6 PM CST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Power outages and tree damage are likely due to the
ice. Travel could be very treacherous. The hazardous conditions
could impact the Monday evening and Tuesday morning commutes.</description>
<instruction>Travel is strongly discouraged. If you must travel, keep an extra
flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case of an
emergency. Prepare for possible power outages.
For the latest travel conditions, check the Iowa 511 app,
