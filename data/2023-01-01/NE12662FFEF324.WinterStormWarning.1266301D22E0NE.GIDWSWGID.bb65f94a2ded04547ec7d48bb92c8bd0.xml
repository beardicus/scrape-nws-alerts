<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM MONDAY TO NOON CST
TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation expected. Total snow
accumulations of 1 to 4 inches and ice accumulations of two
tenths to four tenths of an inch. Winds gusting as high as 35
mph.
* WHERE...Portions of central, east central and south central
Nebraska.
* WHEN...From 6 AM Monday to noon CST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Power outages and tree damage are likely due to the
ice. Travel could be nearly impossible. Patchy blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions
could impact both commutes on Monday, and at least the morning
commute on Tuesday.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Areas of freezing rain will develop across
the area Monday morning as temperatures hover very near the
freezing mark, and remain there through the remainder of the
daytime hours. Freezing rain will change over to snow Monday
evening or Monday night, before tapering off to mainly flurries
by Tuesday afternoon. The highest snow accumulations are
expected to be north of the Platte River. Increasing
northwesterly wind gusts up to 35 MPH may cause blowing snow, as
well as tree and power line damage Monday night through Tuesday.
Exact storm track remains somewhat uncertain, and additional
forecast adjustments are likely tonight and Monday. Stay tuned
for updated information!</description>
