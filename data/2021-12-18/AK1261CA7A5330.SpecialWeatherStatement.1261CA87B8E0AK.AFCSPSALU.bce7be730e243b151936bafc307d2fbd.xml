<description>...A WINTRY MIX OF PRECIPITATION EXPECTED ACROSS THE KUSKOKWIM
DELTA AND MIDDLE KUSKOKWIM VALLEY THIS WEEKEND...
Low pressure over eastern Russia will advance a front across
Southwest Alaska Saturday. Precipitation is expected to develop
along the coast Saturday morning and move over the interior of
the Kuskokwim Delta and Middle Kuskokwim Valley Saturday
afternoon and evening. With temperatures in the upper 20s to lower
30s, the precipitation will start off as snow. However, as the
front moves inland, a strong southwesterly flow off the Bering
Sea will usher in warmer air and allow temperatures to climb in
the middle to upper 30s across the Kuskokwim Delta and the lower
to middle 30s for the Middle Kuskokwim Valley. Warming
temperatures will allow snow to changeover to rain from west to
east beginning Saturday afternoon. A brief period of sleet and
freezing rain is possible prior to the changeover to rain,
especially in sheltered valleys from east of Bethel to Sleetmute,
where colder air may remain in place longer. If any sleet or
freezing rain does occur, only trace amounts are expected. 2 to 4
inches of snow is expected across the Kuskokwim Delta and 1 to 3
inches for the Middle Kuskokwim Valley prior to the changeover to
rain.
For the Kuskokwim Delta, rain is expected to linger into Sunday
before changing back to snow late Sunday evening as a cold front
moves across the region. For the Middle Kuskokwim Valley, mixed
rain and snow Sunday morning will transition back to all snow by
late Sunday afternoon.</description>
