<description>...HIGH RIVER LEVELS AND NEAR RECORD WARM TEMPERATURES TO PERSIST
INTO MID-NEXT WEEK...
Near persistent warm temperatures in higher elevations will continue
to cause snow and ice melt into rivers of Upper Lynn Canal including
the Taiya, the Skagway, and the Klehini Rivers. This has caused high
water levels and near bankfull conditions in rivers and streams
throughout Upper Lynn Canal.
There are indications that very warm temperatures in the 80s will
move back into the region late this weekend into early next week.
Daily high temperature records will likely fall in some areas. This
will raise water levels even more from snow and ice melt.
To minimize impacts of the heat, locate fans for cooling; wear
light-colored and loose fitting clothes; drink plenty of fluids,
apply sun protection, and take breaks if you must be outdoors for
extended periods; do not leave young children and pets unattended in
closed vehicles; and plan to check on the elderly, those who are
home-bound, and other loved ones and neighbors who could be more
vulnerable. Check for updates into the weekend.
For Taiya River near Skagway:
At 4:00pm the stage was 15.76 feet.
Flood Stage is 16.5 feet.
Forecast: A crest around 16.2 feet is expected around 10:00pm
Saturday.
Impacts:
At 16.1 feet: Portions of the Chilkoot Trail begins to inundate with
water.</description>
