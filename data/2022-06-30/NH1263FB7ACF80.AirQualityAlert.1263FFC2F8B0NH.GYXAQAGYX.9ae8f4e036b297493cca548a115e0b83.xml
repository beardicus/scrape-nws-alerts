<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM TO 11 PM EDT FRIDAY...
The Maine Department of Environmental Protection`s Bureau of Air
Quality has issued an Air Quality Alert for ozone from 11 AM to
11 PM EDT Friday.
Ozone levels are expected to rise into the Unhealthy for Sensitive
Groups range Friday. At elevated ozone levels, children, healthy
adults who exert themselves, and individuals suffering from a
respiratory disease such as asthma, bronchitis, or COPD can
experience reduced lung function and irritation. When this happens,
individuals may notice a shortness of breath, coughing, throat
irritation, and or experience an uncomfortable sensation in their
chest. Individuals are encouraged to limit the intensity and duration
of outdoor activities.
The Maine Department of Environmental Protection recommends that
individuals consider limiting strenuous outdoor physical activity to
reduce the risk of adverse health effects. People who may be
especially sensitive to the effects of elevated levels of pollutants
include the very young, the elderly and those with pre-existing
respiratory problems such as asthma and or heart disease. Those with
symptoms should consider consulting their personal physician.
A toll free air quality hotline has been established so Maine
residents can stay informed on the air quality situations. The toll
free number is: 1-800-223-1196.
Additionally the Maine Department of Environmental Protection has
the air quality forecast available on the web at
