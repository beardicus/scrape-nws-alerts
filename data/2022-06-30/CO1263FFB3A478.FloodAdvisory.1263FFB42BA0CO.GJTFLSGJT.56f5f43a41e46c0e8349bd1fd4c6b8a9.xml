* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 852 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms over the Pine Gulch burn scar. This will cause
arroyo and small stream flooding. Between 0.2 and 0.8 inches
of rain have fallen.
- This includes the following streams and drainages...
North Dry Fork, Middle Dry Fork, Kimball Creek, Big Salt
Wash, South Dry Fork, Corcoran Wash, Little Salt Wash, Roan
Creek and Coal Gulch.

mainly rural areas of Southwestern Garfield and North Central
Mesa Counties</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.</instruction>
