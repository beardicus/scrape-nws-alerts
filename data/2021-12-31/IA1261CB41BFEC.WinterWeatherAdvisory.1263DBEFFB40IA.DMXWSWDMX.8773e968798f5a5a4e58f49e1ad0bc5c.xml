<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 31 at 3:15PM CST until December 31 at 6:00PM CST by NWS DesMoines</headline>
<description>...Significant Storm and Cold to Impact Area New Year`s Day...
.Freezing drizzle is expected to develop and expand into this
afternoon across parts of central Iowa and may create extremely
icy conditions. A brief lull overnight before a significant storm
system with the potential for moderate to heavy snow over
portions of central and southern Iowa will impact the area New
Year`s Day. The combination of strong north winds and a dry, more
powdery snow will cause blowing and drifting snow and potentially
significant travel problems in the areas affected. Also,
temperatures and wind chills through most of the event will be
quite cold and with sub-zero wind chills expected by early
Saturday through Saturday night when the coldest air of the
season moves into Iowa. Dangerous wind chill values are expected
across northern Iowa.

EVENING...

* WHERE...Parts of central Iowa.
* WHEN...For the first Winter Weather Advisory, until 6 PM CST
this evening. For the second Winter Weather Advisory, from 6
AM Saturday to midnight CST Saturday night.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Patchy blowing
