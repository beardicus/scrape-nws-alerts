<description>...Strong to Severe Storms Possible Tonight and Saturday Morning...
...Ice and Snow Accumulations Possible Saturday...
...Much Colder Air Expected This Weekend...
A strong cold front is expected to move into northeast Oklahoma
late Friday night and early Saturday morning, and then cross all
of eastern Oklahoma and northwest Arkansas by later Saturday.
Strong to severe storms will be possible Friday night and Saturday
morning, mainly across southeast Oklahoma into west central Arkansas.
Damaging wind gusts could occur with the strongest storms.  An
isolated tornado is possible. Higher potential is expected to be
along and south of a line from Antlers to Fort Smith to Ozark.
Temperatures will start falling by early Saturday morning north
of Interstate 44 and will begin falling during the morning and
early afternoon farther south and east. Temperatures will continue
to fall through Sunday morning with most locations seeing
temperatures in the teens. Dangerous wind chills around 5 below
zero to five above zero are expected late Saturday night into
Sunday morning.
While there remains uncertainty, there is higher confidence in
some wintry precipitation occurring Saturday and Saturday night.
Some ice and light snow accumulation will be possible in some
places. The greater potential for ice accumulation is forecast
north of Interstate 44 Saturday. Gusty northerly winds could
create isolated power outages within locations of ice accumulations.
Snow flurries are possible in the much of the area Saturday night.
It is likely that a rather narrow band of snow will move across parts
of eastern Oklahoma and northwest Arkansas Saturday. A few areas could
see some minor accumulations.
The drastic temperature change also continues to be one of the
main impacts with this storm system.  If you have things outdoors
that have been fine during the warm weather, such as garden hoses,
irrigation systems, or sensitive plants, precautions should be taken
to protect them. Don`t forget about your outdoor pets as well!
Keep up with the latest forecasts as additional information
continues to stream in.</description>
