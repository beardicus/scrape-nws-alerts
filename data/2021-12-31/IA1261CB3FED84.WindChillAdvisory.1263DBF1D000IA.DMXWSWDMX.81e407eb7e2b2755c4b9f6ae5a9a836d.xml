<description>...Significant Storm and Cold to Impact Area New Year`s Day...
.A significant storm system with the potential for moderate to
heavy snow over portions of central and southern Iowa will impact
the area New Year`s Day. The combination of strong north winds
and a dry, more powdery snow will cause blowing and drifting snow
and potentially significant travel problems in the areas
affected. Also, temperatures and wind chills through most of the
event will be quite cold and with sub-zero wind chills expected
by early Saturday through Saturday night when the coldest air of
the season moves into Iowa. Dangerous wind chill values are
expected across northern Iowa.

TO 6 AM CST SATURDAY...

MIDNIGHT CST SATURDAY NIGHT...

35 mph. For the Wind Chill Advisory, very cold wind chills
expected. Wind chills as low as 25 below zero.
* WHERE...Portions of Western and Northern Iowa.
* WHEN...For the Winter Weather Advisory, from 6 AM Saturday to
midnight CST Saturday night. For the Wind Chill Advisory, from
9 PM this evening to 6 AM CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Patchy blowing snow
