<description>...STORMY START TO THE NEW YEAR...
Will see a return to more active weather later this weekend.
Strong westerly flow over the Pacific will bring rather wet and
breezy fronts to the region, with the first one arriving on
Sunday, followed by others through next week.
Southerly winds will increase along the coast Saturday night, with
south winds gusting 55 to 65 mph late Saturday night through
Sunday afternoon, with strong gales expected on the coastal
waters. As usual, the strongest winds will be on the coastal
headlands and exposed lowlands. Another front arriving later
Wednesday will bring another round of gusty south winds.
Rain may be heavy at times on Sunday into Sunday night, and again
at times through next week. Rivers will be on the rise once again
next week. At this time, flooding concerns are low, but those
along rivers will need to keep an ear open for later forecasts
next week.
Seas will be building, with 15 to 20 ft possible and likely a bit
higher at times late Sunday into Monday. This will create a
chaotic and turbulent surf zone along the beaches. With the new
moon, astronomical tides will be stronger. That, combined with the
higher seas, will likely cause some minor tidal flooding in low
lying areas along the coast.
All in all, expect a return to active, possible hazardous
weather along the coast next week. Use caution in and near the
surf zones, and be alert for sneaker waves and debris in the surf
zone.</description>
