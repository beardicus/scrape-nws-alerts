<headline>Wind Chill Advisory issued December 31 at 5:25PM CST until January 01 at 6:00AM CST by NWS DesMoines</headline>
<description>...Significant Storm and Cold to Impact Area New Year`s Day...
.Continued freezing drizzle will lead to icy spots on roads and
walking surfaces this evening. A brief lull is expected overnight
before a significant storm system with the potential for moderate
to heavy snow over portions of central and southern Iowa will
impact the area New Year`s Day. The combination of strong north
winds and a dry, more powdery snow will cause blowing and drifting
snow and potentially significant travel problems in the areas
affected. Also, temperatures and wind chills through most of the
event will be quite cold and with sub-zero wind chills expected by
early Saturday through Saturday night when the coldest air of the
season moves into Iowa. Dangerous wind chill values are expected
across northern Iowa.
