<description>...Flood Potential Outlook for Coos, Curry, Douglas, and Josephine
Counties....
Quick rises and possible flooding on area streams, creeks, and
rivers due to the combination of heavy rainfall and snow melt in
the following counties in Oregon... Coos, Curry, Douglas, and
Josephine.
A series of fronts is likely to bring periods of moderate to heavy
precipitation totaling 2 to 6 inches of water to southwestern
Oregon Monday, January 3rd through Wednesday, January 5th. Much of
this precipitation is likely to fall as rain, especially Tuesday
into Wednesday. The combination of the expected rainfall along
with lower to mid-elevation snow melt will bring the possibility
of flooding to the area.
Currently, Deer Creek near Roseburg could reach flood stage later
Monday into Tuesday and the Coquille River at Coquille could reach
flood stage as early as Wednesday morning. Other rivers across the
area are likely to rise significantly during that time period and
it is within the realm of possibility that they could near or
exceed flood stage, but it is too early to determine if they will
at time.
A flood potential outlook is issued when there is the potential
for significant rises or flooding along rivers and streams.
The exact scenario for flooding remains uncertain. This product
will be updated as necessary. Watches and warnings may be issued
by the National Weather Service if this situation worsens.</description>
