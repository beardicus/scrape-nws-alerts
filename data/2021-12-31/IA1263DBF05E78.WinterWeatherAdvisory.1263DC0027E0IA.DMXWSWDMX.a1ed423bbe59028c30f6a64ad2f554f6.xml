<description>...Significant Storm and Cold to Impact Area New Year`s Day...
.A significant storm system with the potential for moderate to
heavy snow over portions of central and southern Iowa will impact
the area New Year`s Day. The combination of strong north winds and
a dry, more powdery snow will cause blowing and drifting snow and
potentially significant travel problems in the areas affected.
Also, temperatures and wind chills through most of the event will
be quite cold and with sub-zero wind chills expected by early
Saturday through Saturday night when the coldest air of the season
moves into Iowa. Dangerous wind chill values are expected across
northern Iowa.

SATURDAY...

TO MIDNIGHT CST SATURDAY NIGHT...

* WHAT...For the Wind Chill Advisory, very cold wind chills
expected. Wind chills as low as 25 below zero. For the Winter
Weather Advisory, snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 2
to 4 inches. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.

this evening. For the Wind Chill Advisory, from 9 PM this
evening to 6 AM CST Saturday. For the second Winter Weather
