<description>...A SERIES OF HEAVY RAIN SHOWERS WILL IMPACT SOUTHEASTERN
TRANSYLVANIA...NORTHWESTERN GREENVILLE AND PICKENS COUNTIES UNTIL
945 AM EDT...
At 849 AM EDT, Doppler radar was tracking a series of heavy rain
showers across Pickens, northwest Greenville, and southeast
Transylavnia Counties moving slowly north at 10 mph but also
redeveloping from the south. These showers were producing rainfall
at rates of one-half to three-quarters of an inch per hour and some
locations are closing in on one to two inches of rain in the past
three hours. Deep standing water and isolated flooding near stream
banks could result. A Flood Advisory could be needed if the showers
do not taper off soon.
Locations to be impacted include... Pickens, Six Mile,
Jocassee Gorges, Dupont State Forest, Keowee Toxaway State Park,
Table Rock State Park, Caesars Head State Park, Jones Gap State
Park, Liberty and Lake Jocassee.
Heavy rainfall rates up to an inch per hour will be possible
through 10 am.</description>
<instruction>Heavy rainfall may flood areas with poor drainage, such as ditches
and underpasses. Avoid these areas and do not cross flooded roads.
Water levels of small streams may also rise rapidly. Seek higher
ground if threatened by flood waters.</instruction>
