are occurring with these storms. Move indoors immediately.
Lightning is one of nature`s leading killers. Remember, if you can
hear thunder, you are close enough to be struck by lightning.
If on or near Lake Havasu, or the Colorado River as far north as
Mohave Valley, get away from the water and move indoors or inside a
vehicle. Remember, lightning can strike out to 15 miles from the
parent thunderstorm. If you can hear thunder, you are close enough
to be struck by lightning. Move to safe shelter now! Do not be
caught on the water in a thunderstorm.</instruction>
