producing heavy rain along a line extending from near Clemmons to
near Kernersville. Movement was north at 10 mph.
HAZARD...Multiple rounds of storms have produced heavy rain.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Heavy rain may cause isolated flooding especially in poor
drainage locations. Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs
and blow around unsecured objects.

Winston-Salem, High Point, Kernersville, Clemmons, Bermuda Run,
Huntsville, Lewisville, Walkertown, Rural Hall and Pfafftown.
MAX HAIL SIZE...0.00 IN

<instruction>Torrential rainfall is also occurring with these storms and may lead
to localized flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flooded
roadways.
Very heavy rain can be expected due to the slow movement of this
storm. Prolonged heavy rain will result in ponding of water on
roadways, standing water in low lying areas, and minor flooding of
creeks and streams. Drivers are urged to slow down and use extra
caution to avoid hydroplaning.</instruction>
