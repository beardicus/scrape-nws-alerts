<instruction>Severe thunderstorms produce damaging
winds, destructive hail, deadly
lightning and very heavy rain. For your
protection, move to an interior room on the lowest
floor of your home or business. Heavy rains flood roads quickly so do
not drive into areas where water covers the road.
In addition to large hail and damaging, continuous cloud to ground lightning is
occurring with this storm. Move indoors immediately. Lightning is
one of nature`s leading killers. Remember, if you can hear
thunder, you are close enough to be struck by lightning.
Torrential rainfall is also occurring with this storm, and may lead
to flash flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flooded
roadways.</instruction>
