Large hail and damaging winds and continuous cloud to ground
lightning is occurring with these storms. Move indoors immediately.
Lightning is one of nature`s leading killers. Remember, if you can
hear thunder, you are close enough to be struck by lightning.
If on or near the Colorado River from Mohave Valley to south of Lake
Havasu, get away from the water and move indoors or inside a
vehicle. Remember, lightning can strike out to 15 miles from the
parent thunderstorm. If you can hear thunder, you are close enough
to be struck by lightning. Move to safe shelter now! Do not be
caught on the water in a thunderstorm.</instruction>
