<headline>Special Weather Statement issued September 04 at 3:46PM EDT  by NWS Raleigh</headline>
<description>...A slow moving storm producing heavy rain will impact portions of
east central Forsyth County through 445 PM EDT...
At 343 PM EDT, Doppler radar was tracking a strong thunderstorm over
Kernersville, or 10 miles east of Winston-Salem. This storm was
nearly stationary. Kernersville has already received up to an inch
of rain in the past hour.
HAZARD...Multiple rounds of storms have produced heavy rain.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Heavy rain may cause isolated flooding especially in poor
drainage locations. Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs
and blow around unsecured objects.
Locations impacted include...
Kernersville, Walkertown and Sedge Garden.
MAX HAIL SIZE...0.00 IN
MAX WIND GUST...30 MPH</description>
<instruction>Torrential rainfall is also occurring with this storm and may lead to
localized flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flooded
roadways.
Very heavy rain can be expected due to the slow movement of this
storm. Prolonged heavy rain will result in ponding of water on
roadways, standing water in low lying areas, and minor flooding of
creeks and streams. Drivers are urged to slow down and use extra
caution to avoid hydroplaning.</instruction>
