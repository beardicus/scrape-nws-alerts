<headline>Flood Warning issued January 27 at 6:50AM CST until further notice by NWS Chicago</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by a combination of rain, snowmelt and
heavy river ice continues.
* WHERE...Along the Kankakee River from Kankakee River State Park
downstream to near the Grundy/Will county line, including portions
of Grundy and Will counties.
* WHEN...Until further notice
* IMPACTS...Flooding of roads and streets will continue. Yards and
other low-lying areas will remain inundated by water and ice.
Shifting ice may damage structures along the shore. Water levels
will remain high over the weekend due to high streamflow resulting
from a combination of recent rains and snowmelt.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 640 AM CST, river gauge data indicates that river levels
have dropped several feet since last night and continue to
fall while remaining in flood stage. Flash flood warnings for
this ice jam break have been cancelled. However, residual
flooding will persist. Additionally, fluctuations in river
levels will be possible as residual upstream ice moves
through the area.

<instruction>A Flood Warning means flooding is imminent or may already be
occurring. Persons along rivers, creeks, and other waterways should
take immediate precautions to protect life and property.</instruction>
