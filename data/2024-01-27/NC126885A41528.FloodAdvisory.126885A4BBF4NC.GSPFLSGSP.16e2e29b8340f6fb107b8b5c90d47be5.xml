* WHEN...Until 1215 AM EST.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 913 PM EST, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms. This will cause urban and small stream
flooding. Between 1 and 2 inches of rain have fallen.
Most stream levels across the Charlotte metro area are
running high, but are currently below advisory levels.
However, heavy rainfall is beginning to train across the area
from the southwest, which will bring many streams to bankfull
or flooding levels over the next hour. If the heavy rainfall
persists before shifting east, a flash flood warning may be
needed.
- Additional rainfall amounts up to 1 inch are expected over
the area. This additional rain will result in minor flooding.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Uptown Charlotte, Central Charlotte, South Charlotte,
Southwest Charlotte, East Charlotte, Northeast Charlotte,
Northwest Charlotte, Matthews, Mint Hill, Fort Mill, Belmont,
Pineville, Tega Cay, Marvin, Freedom Park, Southpark Mall,
Charlotte Douglas Airport, The Arboretum, The Plaza and
Carowinds.
