to the river forecast.
A Flood Warning means water levels above flood stage are imminent or
may already be occurring. Persons along rivers and streams in the
warned area should take immediate precautions to protect life and
property.
Report flooding to the National Weather Service or your local law
enforcement agency only when you can do so safely.
