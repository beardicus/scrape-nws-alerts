&amp;&amp;</description>
<instruction>An ice jam is likely affecting water levels in this area. River
forecasts during periods of heavy river ice cover and ice jams are
less certain due to many complicated factors. Significant river ice
cover can cause large water level fluctuations and flooding with
little advanced notice. River ice may also cause gauge observations
to be inaccurate.
A Flood Warning means water levels above flood stage are imminent or
may already be occurring. Persons along rivers and streams in the
warned area should take immediate precautions to protect life and
property.
Report flooding to the National Weather Service or your local law
enforcement agency only when you can do so safely.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
The next statement will be issued by late tonight at 530 AM CST.</instruction>
