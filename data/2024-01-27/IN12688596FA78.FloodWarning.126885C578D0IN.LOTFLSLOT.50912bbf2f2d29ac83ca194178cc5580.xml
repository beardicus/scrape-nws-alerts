&amp;&amp;</description>
<instruction>River rises are being affected by significant river ice cover and by
snowmelt. Significant river ice cover can lead to ice jams that
cause large water level fluctuations and flooding with little
advanced notice.
A Flood Warning means that water levels above flood stage are
imminent or may already be occurring. Persons along rivers and
streams in the warned area should take immediate precautions to
protect life and property.
Report flooding to the National Weather Service or your local law
enforcement agency only when you can do so safely.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
The next statement will be issued by late tonight at 430 AM CST.</instruction>
