<headline>Flood Warning issued January 27 at 10:40AM CST until February 06 at 1:42AM CST by NWS Indianapolis</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning is extended for a portion of the following
river in Indiana...Illinois...
Wabash River, from Lafayette downstream to Riverton.
.Lowland flooding continues along much of the Wabash River, from
Lafayette down to Riverton.  There is low potential for flooding to
develop during the second half of the week of January 28 at
Vincennes.  The river is rising at all locations south of
Lafayette.  Flooding could be made worse by any ice jams that
develop during ice break up, but this threat is diminishing due to
the amount of time air temperatures are spending above the freezing
mark.
River levels on the White River at Elliston, Edwardsport,
Petersburg, and Hazleton will be monitored for possible upcoming
flood warnings.
