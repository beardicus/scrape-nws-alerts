<headline>Flood Warning issued January 27 at 11:40AM EST until February 02 at 5:00AM EST by NWS Indianapolis</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning is extended for a portion of the following
river in Indiana...Illinois...
Wabash River, from Lafayette downstream to Riverton.
.Lowland flooding continues along much of the Wabash River, from
Lafayette down to Riverton.  There is low potential for flooding to
develop during the second half of the week of January 28 at
Vincennes.  The river is rising at all locations south of
Lafayette.  Flooding could be made worse by any ice jams that
develop during ice break up, but this threat is diminishing due to
the amount of time air temperatures are spending above the freezing
mark.
River levels on the White River at Elliston, Edwardsport,
Petersburg, and Hazleton will be monitored for possible upcoming
flood warnings.
...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL EARLY FRIDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Wabash River at Clinton.
* WHEN...Until early Friday morning.

runs through the City of Clinton`s wastewater treatment plant.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- There is no current observed data.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise to a crest of 20.6
feet Monday morning. It will then fall below flood stage
Thursday afternoon.
- Flood stage is 18.0 feet.

<instruction>Motorists should not attempt to drive around barricades or drive
cars through flooded areas.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. Most flood related deaths
occur in automobiles. Do not attempt to cross water covered bridges,
dips, or low water crossings. Never try to cross a flowing stream,
even a small one, on foot. To escape rising water find another route
over higher ground.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov/ind.
