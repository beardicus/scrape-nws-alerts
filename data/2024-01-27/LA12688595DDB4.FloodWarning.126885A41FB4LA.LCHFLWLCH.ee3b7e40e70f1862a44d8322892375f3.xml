<senderName>NWS Lake Charles (Southeast Texas and Southwest Louisiana)</senderName>
<headline>Flood Warning issued January 27 at 3:01AM CST until further notice by NWS Lake Charles</headline>
<description>.Saturated grounds with very heavy rainfall have allowed for
flooding across the warned area. While heavy rain has ended, many
water ways remain elevated or exceed bankfull. Some roads also are
flooded. It will take several hours for flood waters to recede.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM CST THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of southwest Louisiana, including the following
parishes, Allen, Beauregard, Calcasieu and Jefferson Davis.
* WHEN...Until 900 AM CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring. Streams
continue to rise due to excess runoff from earlier rainfall.
Low-water crossings are inundated with water and may not be
passable. It will take several hours for all the water from these
storms to work through local drainage systems in urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 301 AM CST, Doppler radar indicated earlier heavy rain due
to thunderstorms. Flooding is ongoing in the warned area.
Between 2 and 5 inches of rain have fallen.
- Flooding impacts will continue, but no additional rainfall is
expected.
