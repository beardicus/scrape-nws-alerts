<description>...STRONG WINDS COMBINED WITH HEAVY SNOW FOR THE PRIBILOF ISLANDS
LATE TONIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING...
A compact storm system from Siberia is forecast to track across
the Pribilof Islands late tonight into early Sunday morning,
bringing a quick round of heavy snow and strong east-northeasterly
winds gusting as high as 35 to 45 mph. Gusty winds combined with
heavy snowfall may reduce visibility to one mile or less at times
due to blowing snow. The worst conditions will be brief, likely
lasting only a few hours around midnight tonight. This system is
expected to bring 2-4 inches of new snowfall to the Pribilofs
during this time. Model discrepancies have become minor, providing
high confidence that this will be a quick system, however the
blowing snow and reduced visibilities will still be prominent
while the system moves through.</description>
