<description>...PERIODS OF HEAVY RAINFALL THIS WEEK WILL BRING A THREAT OF
FLOODING...
Rain chances are expected to increase Tuesday and remain high
through Saturday as several waves of precipitation move through
Central Alabama. Currently, forecast rainfall totals range from 2-3
inches in the southeast to over 6 inches across Marion and Winston
counties. Much of this rainfall could occur on Wednesday into
Thursday, and areas of northwest Central Alabama have been placed in
a Moderate Risk for Excessive Rainfall by the WPC.
Heavy rainfall could cause streams and flood prone areas to quickly
become inundated. A Flash Flood or Flood Watch may be issued in
later forecasts, and the axis of highest rainfall totals may change
as the week evolves.
Interests across Central Alabama are urged to monitor the latest
forecasts and be prepared to take quick action if flooding
develops.</description>
