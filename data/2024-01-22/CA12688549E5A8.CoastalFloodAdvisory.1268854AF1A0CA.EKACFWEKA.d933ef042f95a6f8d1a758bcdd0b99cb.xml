<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued January 22 at 3:14AM PST until January 22 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Eureka</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 7 AM TO 10 AM PST THIS
MORNING...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH
TUESDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, High astronomical tides
will cause minor flooding in low lying areas around Humboldt
Bay. Up to one half foot of saltwater inundation above ground
level is possible near shorelines and tidal waterways. Between
8.8 and 9.2 feet MLLW at the North Spit tide gauge is
predicted. For the Beach Hazards Statement, increased threat of
sneaker waves expected.
* WHERE...Northern Humboldt Coast County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 7 AM to 10 AM PST
this morning. For the Beach Hazards Statement, from late tonight
through Tuesday morning. High tide is at 8:38 AM at the
Humboldt Bay North Spit tide gauge. Saltwater inundation will be
possible 1 to 2 hours before and after high tide.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of low lying areas around Humboldt Bay
including parks and roads with only isolated closures expected.
Flooding will likely impact Jackson Ranch Road in the Arcata
Bottoms and several roads in King Salmon. Large, unexpected
waves can sweep across the beach without warning, sweeping
people into the sea from rocks, jetties, and beaches. These
sneaker waves can also move large objects such as logs, crushing
anyone caught underneath.</description>
<instruction>A Coastal Flood Advisory indicates that onshore winds and tides
will combine to generate flooding of low areas along the shore.
Feet Above Ground is locally defined as feet above the Highest
Astronomical Tide or HAT.
Don`t be fooled by an ocean that looks calm. There can be
30 minutes of small waves before a sneaker wave strikes. Avoid
rocks and jetties. Avoid steep beaches. Stay much farther back
from the water and never turn your back on the ocean.</instruction>
