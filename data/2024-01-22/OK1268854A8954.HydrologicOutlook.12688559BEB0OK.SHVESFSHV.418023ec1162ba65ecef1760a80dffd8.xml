<description>...Significant Rainfall Expected This Week...
An active storm track will lead to several rounds of heavy
rainfall across the Four State Region beginning today and
continuing through Wednesday night.
Average rainfall totals during this period are expected to range
from 5 to 7 inches, with locally higher amounts likely in a few
locations.
While widespread major river flooding is currently not expected,
given the recent cold temperatures, water runoff is likely to be
enhanced, resulting in isolated flash flooding, areas of minor to
moderate river flooding, ponding on area roadways, and minor
flooding in urban areas and areas of poor drainage.
While forecast confidence is high in widespread moderate to heavy
rainfall affecting the area, some uncertainty exists in the
overall magnitude of rainfall as well as where the heaviest
rounds of rainfall set up and which locations they repeatedly move
over. Stay tuned to the latest forecasts through this upcoming
week.</description>
