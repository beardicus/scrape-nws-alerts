<headline>Flood Watch issued January 22 at 12:44PM CST until further notice by NWS Chicago</headline>
<description>...The Flood Watch continues for the following rivers in Illinois...
Kankakee River at Momence affecting Kankakee County.
...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL FURTHER
NOTICE...
* WHAT...Flooding is possible.
* WHERE...Kankakee River from IL/IN state line downstream to
confluence with Iroquois River at Aroma Park, including the
Momence gauge.
* WHEN...Until further notice.
* IMPACTS...Low-lying wetlands, forest land, park land and
agricultural land along the river may flood. Roadways along the
river may flood.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 11:45 AM CST Monday the stage was 3.9 feet. River gauge
data and river ice spotter reports indicated an ice jam from
near Kankakee to near Sun River Terrace. Emergency management
reported a decrease in water levels in some areas over the
last few days, but flooding may reoccur if ice shifts or
breaks.
- Forecast...The river may exceed flood stage over the next
several days if the ongoing ice jam worsens or if new ice
jams form.
- Flood stage is 5.0 feet.

&amp;&amp;</description>
<instruction>An ice jam is affecting water levels in this area. River forecasts
during ice jams are less certain due to many complicated factors.
Significant river ice cover can cause large water level fluctuations
and flooding with little advanced notice. River ice may also cause
gauge observations to be inaccurate.
These forecasts are based on observed precipitation as well as
forecast precipitation 48 hours into the future. Changes to the
rainfall forecast, or any additional rainfall after 48 hours, may
cause changes to these river forecasts.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
The next statement will be issued by late tonight at midnight CST.</instruction>
