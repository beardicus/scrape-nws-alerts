<description>...Heavy Rain and Potential Flooding Expected This Week...
Rain chances are expected to increase tonight and then persist
through much of the week as a series of upper level disturbances
impact the Mid-South. Several rounds of heavy rain will move across
the region through Thursday. In addition, the residual snow and ice,
as well as the near freezing ground temperatures will increase the
amount of rain that runs off into the rivers and streams.
Portions of the Mid-South, are forecast to receive 3-5 inches, with
locally higher amounts possible. The highest rainfall amounts are
expected over northeast Mississippi and this region has been placed
in a moderate risk for excessive rainfall. The majority of the rest
of the Mid-South is currently in a slight risk for excessive
rainfall. Significant flash flooding, as well as urban and small
stream flooding is expected. Also, current ensemble river guidance
is suggesting widespread minor to isolated moderate river flooding.
Stay tuned to updates and potential Watches and Warnings as this
event gets closer, and prepare with your flood safety plan
accordingly.</description>
