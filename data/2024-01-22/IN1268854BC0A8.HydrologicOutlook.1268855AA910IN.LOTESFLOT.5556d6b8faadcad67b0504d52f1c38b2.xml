<description>...Elevated river levels and shifting river ice possible later this
week...
The risk for elevated river levels and shifting river ice will
steadily increase this week due to warming temperatures and light
rainfall. The highest risk for elevated river levels and shifting
river ice is along the Kankakee, Iroquois, and Vermilion rivers,
with a lower risk along the Fox and Illinois rivers.
A substantial snow cover exists across most of northern Illinois,
with water equivalent values ranging from 0.5-2.0 inches, which is
above average for this time of year. In addition, heavy ice cover
exists on most area rivers with multiple ongoing ice jams, and near
surface soils are frozen to a depth of several inches. Temperatures
are expected to warm into the mid and upper 30s by the late this
week. This should begin to warm the very cold snowpack and
eventually lead to slow melting. Light rainfall early this week will
at first cause little runoff as it will be absorbed by the cold
snowpack. Runoff will eventually occur as snowmelt is partially
blocked by the frozen soils underneath. If temperatures remain in
the 30s, snow melt will generally remain slow and steady, limiting
rises on area rivers and streams to near bankfull or lower.
Confidence in temperature forecasts is relatively high for the first
part of this week, but decreases slightly by Thursday through early
next week. If temperatures are able to warm well into the 40s,
enough melting may occur for rivers to rise to above bankfull in
some areas. Standing water would also be likely along small creeks
and other poor drainage areas. Shifting river ice along area rivers
would occur with a risk for break-up ice jams.
This outlook means that elevated water levels and potential impacts
are possible, but not yet certain. Persons with interests along area
rivers should closely monitor the latest forecasts.
This product will be updated by tomorrow afternoon.</description>
