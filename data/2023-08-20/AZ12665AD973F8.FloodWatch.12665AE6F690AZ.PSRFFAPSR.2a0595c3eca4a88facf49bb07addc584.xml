<headline>Flood Watch issued August 20 at 9:46AM MST until August 20 at 10:00PM MST by NWS Phoenix</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of southwest Arizona, including the following
areas, Central La Paz, Gila River Valley, Kofa, Parker Valley,
Southeast Yuma County and Yuma. Portions of California, including
the following areas, Chiriaco Summit, Chuckwalla Mountains,
Chuckwalla Valley, Imperial County Southeast, Imperial County
Southwest, Imperial County West, Imperial Valley, Joshua Tree NP
East, Joshua Tree NP West, Palo Verde Valley and Salton Sea.
* WHEN...Through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Area creeks
and streams are running high and could flood with more heavy rain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A rich moisture plume will accompany tropical cyclone Hilary
as it progresses into Southern California today. This
will result in widespread heavy rainfall across Southern
California and Southwestern Arizona. A combination of rapid
onset and slow response flooding is expected with high
rainfall rates and totals. Rainfall totals will be highest in
the mountains of Southern California, in upslope favored
regions, and with banding features. With rainfall amounts
forecast around 2-6 inches along and west of the Lower
Colorado River Valley, and localized amounts up to 8 inches
possible across higher terrain areas including Joshua Tree
National Park, there is potential for widespread significant
flooding, and localized catastrophic flooding, across the
region.
