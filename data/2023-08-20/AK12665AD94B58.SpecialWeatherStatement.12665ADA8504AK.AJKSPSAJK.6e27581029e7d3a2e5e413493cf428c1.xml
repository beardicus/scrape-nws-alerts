<description>...SECOND RELEASE ON MENDENHALL LAKE AND RIVER HAS STARTED...
GAGE DATA AND IMAGERY FROM SUICIDE BASIN INDICATE THAT A SECOND
RELEASE FROM THAT BASIN HAS STARTED. WATER LEVELS IN THE BASIN WERE
ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT A QUARTER AS HIGH AS WHAT WAS OBSERVED AT THE
START OF THE PRIMARY RELEASE EARLIER THIS MONTH. IF THE BASIN
RELEASES ALL OF ITS WATER THE MENDENHALL LAKE AND RIVER ARE STILL
EXPECTED TO REMAIN WITHIN THEIR BANKS WITH A CREST OF AROUND 7.6
FEET (BELOW THE FLOOD STAGE OF 9.0 FEET) ON THE MENDENHALL LAKE GAGE
MONDAY MORNING.
WE DO NOT KNOW IF ALL THE WATER IN THE BASIN WILL RELEASE, NOR
EXACTLY HOW MUCH WATER IS IN THE BASIN. SO EXPECTED CREST HEIGHT AND
TIMING MAY VARY FROM THE FORECAST.</description>
