<headline>Red Flag Warning issued August 20 at 2:04AM MDT until August 20 at 8:00PM MDT by NWS Albuquerque</headline>
<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FOR THE NORTHWEST PLATEAU AND THE
MIDDLE RIO GRANDE VALLEY BETWEEN NOON AND 8 PM TODAY FOR STRONG
WINDS, LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITIES AND AN UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
.A very anomalous hot, dry and windy pattern is on tap for today.
Very dry air, especially for mid to late August, remains in place
of much of northern and central New Mexico. Additionally, as New
Mexico is sandwiched between a stout upper high over the Great
Plains and a tropical system headed for California, unusually
strong southeasterly winds will develop by late morning and
continue through early evening. This will result in critical fire
weather conditions for several hours across the Northwest Plateau
and Middle Rio Grande Valley, to include the Albuquerque Metro
area.
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO 8 PM MDT THIS
EVENING...
The National Weather Service in Albuquerque has issued a Red Flag
Warning...which is in effect from noon today to 8 PM MDT this
evening.
* AREA AND TIMING...This includes the Northwest Plateau (Zone 101)
and the Middle Rio Grande Valley (Zone 106) between noon and 8
PM today.
* 20 FOOT WINDS...Southeast at 20 to 30 mph with gusts up to 40
mph.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...Minimum values between 10 and 15 percent.
* IMPACTS...Any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly.
Outdoor burning is not recommended.</description>
