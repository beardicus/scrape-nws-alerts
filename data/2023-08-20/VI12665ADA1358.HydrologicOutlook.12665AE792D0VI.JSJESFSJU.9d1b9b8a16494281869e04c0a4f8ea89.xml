<headline>Hydrologic Outlook issued August 20 at 4:54PM AST  by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...There is an increased risk of flooding across Puerto Rico and
the U.S. Virgin Islands through midweek...
Showers and thunderstorms associated with the Tropical Storm
Franklin...now located over the eastern Caribbean and well south
of the local islands...will continue to spread across Puerto Rico
and the U.S. Virgin Islands through the middle of the workweek.
Rainbands, with scattered to numerous showers and isolated
thunderstorms, reached the U.S. Virgin Islands and eastern Puerto
Rico this morning, and have spread across the rest of Puerto Rico
in the afternoon. The potential for showers and thunderstorms will
continue tonight and Tuesday. The resulting rains will increase
the risk for urban and small stream flooding as well as flash
flooding, which could also lead to mudslides and rapid river
rises.
Based on the most recent guidance, the most likely period for
scattered to widespread rains will continue through Tuesday
morning, with the areas most likely to receive the highest
rainfall accumulations across eastern and southern sections of
Puerto Rico. In these areas, there is the potential for rainfall
totals to reach 2-4 inches with isolated higher amounts.
Elsewhere across Puerto Rico and across the U.S. Virgin Islands,
rainfall totals of 1-3 inches with isolated higher amounts are
possible.
This product will be updated as needed. Please, continue to
monitor the progress of this feature, which based on the most
recent tropical weather outlook, has a high formation chance
within the next 2-7 days.</description>
