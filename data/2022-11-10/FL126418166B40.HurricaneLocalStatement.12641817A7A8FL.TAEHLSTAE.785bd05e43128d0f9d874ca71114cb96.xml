SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
**CONDITIONS DETERIORATING RAPIDLY AS TROPICAL STORM NICOLE MOVES
ACROSS THE TRI-STATE AREA TODAY AND TONIGHT**
The center of Tropical Storm Nicole is currently over west-central
Florida and will continue moving northwest, passing near the Nature
Coast late this afternoon and evening, then into the Florida Big Bend
and southwest Georgia tonight as it begins a northward turn. Nicole
will is expected to exit southwest Georgia Friday morning.
Tropical storm conditions are entering the Southeast Florida Big Bend,
including the adjacent coastal areas this morning. Tropical storm
conditions will continue spreading northward over the rest of the
Florida Big Bend and Southwest Georgia from late this morning into
this evening, where Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect.
Dangerous storm surge is possible along the shorelines of Apalachee
Bay. Storm Surge Warnings remain in effect from the Ochlockonee River
to the mouth of the Suwannee River. Storm Surge Watches remain in
effect from Indian Pass to the Ochlockonee River. Normally dry land
near the shoreline could experience 3 to 5 feet of inundation,
especially east of the Ochlockonee River.
Storm total rainfall of 2 to 3 inches will be a concern for all areas
east of a line from Dothan to Apalachicola. A lack of recent rainfall
will allow the ground to absorb some of the heavy rain, however,
torrential rainfall over a short period of time leading to isolated
higher amounts could lead to isolated flash flooding.
Isolated tornadoes are possible east of the I-75 corridor in south
Georgia.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
eastern Florida panhandle, Florida Big Bend, southeastern Alabama and
southwestern Georgia. Potential impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* SURGE:
Protect against life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts from the Ochlockonee River to the mouth of the Suwannee
River. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
Also, protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts along the shore of Franklin County.
Elsewhere across eastern Florida panhandle, Florida Big Bend,
southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia, little to no impact is
anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible
significant impacts east of a line from Dothan to Apalachicola.
Potential impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, and ditches
overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
Protect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across the Florida Panhandle and portions of Southeastern
Alabama.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts
east of the I-75 corridor of Southwestern Georgia. Potential impacts
include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
Elsewhere across the eastern Florida panhandle, Florida Big Bend,
southeastern Alabama, and southwestern Georgia west of I-75, little
to no impact is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
For those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,
falling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move,
relocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help
keep roadways open for those under evacuation orders.
Do not enter evacuated areas until officials have given the all
clear to return.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
If you are relocating to safe shelter, leave as early as possible.
Allow extra time to reach your destination. Many roads and bridges
will be closed once strong winds arrive. Check the latest weather
forecast before departing and drive with caution.
Keep cell phones well charged. Cell phone chargers for automobiles
can be helpful, but be aware of your risk for deadly carbon monoxide
poisoning if your car is left idling in a garage or other poorly
ventilated area.
Storm surge is the leading killer associated with tropical storms and
hurricanes! Make sure you are in a safe area away from the surge
zone. Even if you are not in a surge-prone area, you could find
yourself cutoff by flood waters during and after the storm. Heed
evacuation orders issued by the local authorities.
If a Tornado Warning is issued for your area, be ready to shelter
quickly, preferably away from windows and in an interior room not
prone to flooding. If driving, scan the roadside for quick shelter
options.
If in a place that is vulnerable to high wind, such as near large
trees, a manufactured home, upper floors of a high-rise building, or
on a boat, consider moving to a safer shelter before the onset of
strong winds or flooding.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
