SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Nicole will continue to move northwest across the
Nature Coast and into the Northeastern Gulf through tonight. Tropical
Storm winds continue across West-Central Florida today, with the
strongest winds occurring in rain bands. Once winds turn onshore on the
back side of Nicole, life- threatening storm surge inundation up to 5
feet will be possible across the Nature Coast, and inundation of around
3 feet will be possible around Tampa Bay, especially on the Gulf
beaches. A Storm Surge Warning remains in effect for the Nature Coast.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
West Central Florida. Remain well sheltered from hazardous wind having
additional impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across
the Nature Coast. Remain well away from life-threatening surge
impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
Potential impacts from the main surge event are also now unfolding
across Tampa Bay . Remain well away from locally hazardous surge
having possible impacts.
Elsewhere across West Central and Southwest Florida, little to no
impact is anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across the
Nature Coast into West Central Florida. Remain well guarded against
dangerous flood waters having additional impacts. If realized, these
impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals, and
ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
Elsewhere across West Central and Southwest Florida, little to no
impact is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
- Listen to local official for recommended actions.
- Do not enter evacuated areas until officials have given the all
clear to return.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to stay inside and away from windows. Listen for
updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Keep a battery-
powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.
During the peak of the storm be ready to move quickly. Keep your
shoes on and rain gear handy. Boots and athletic shoes offer the best
foot protection if you become unexpectedly exposed to the weather.
Keep your cell phone charged and in power-saving mode. If you lose
power, use it sparingly and mainly for personal emergencies and
check-ins.
Do not venture outside while in the eye of a tropical storm as any
improvement in weather will only be temporary. Once the eye passes,
conditions will become life threatening as winds immediately return to
dangerous speeds, so remain safely sheltered from the storm.
Do not be a thrill seeker or risk your life for senseless photos or
videos.
Quickly move to the safest place within your shelter if it begins to
fail, preferably an interior room on the lowest floor as long as
flooding is not a concern.
If you are prone to flooding or in an area under a storm surge watch
or warning, be prepared for the possibility of a quick and dramatic
rise in water levels.
If a tornado warning is issued for your area, quickly move to the
safest place within your shelter. Protect your head and body.
