SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Nicole recently made landfall at North Hutchinson
Island on the east-central Florida coast and is beginning to gradually
weaken while also moving northwestward away from our area.
The following are the primary lingering hazards of concern with
Nicole:
* Coastal Flooding/Surge - Water levels will be decreasing over the
east coast from those observed on Wednesday as the wind direction
shifts offshore. However, some residual minor to locally moderate
tidal flooding will be possible around this morning`s high tide with
inundation values generally 1 to 3 ft. Additionally some minor
inundations will be possible today over the west coast of Florida as winds
will have a strong onshore component there.
* Wind - Winds to tropical storm force will be possible over the next
few hours over northern Palm Beach county and the Lake region. Winds
will decrease area-wide through the day but will remain breezy with
gusts 25 to 30 mph possible.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
Palm Beach county and the Lake Okeechobee region. Remain well sheltered from dangerous
wind having possible significant impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
Elsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact is anticipated.
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across
coastal regions of South Florida. Remain well away from locally hazardous
surge having additional limited impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread
with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where
surge water covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
Elsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Do not enter evacuated areas until officials have given the all clear
to return.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Keep your cell phone charged and in power-saving mode. If you lose
power, use it sparingly and mainly for personal emergencies and
check-ins.
