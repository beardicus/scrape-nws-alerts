...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM EST FRIDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM EST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, significant coastal
flooding is ongoing. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking
waves of 8 to 10 feet in the surf zone this evening, decreasing
to 6 to 8 feet after midnight. For the High Rip Current Risk,
dangerous life- threatening rip currents.
* WHERE...Volusia and Brevard county coasts.
* WHEN...Through 4 AM EST Friday morning.
* IMPACTS...Coastal roads may be closed. Low lying property
including homes, businesses and some critical infrastructure
will be inundated. Significant shoreline erosion will occur.
Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach
erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from
shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>Coastal flooding is occurring or imminent. Coastal residents in
the warned area should be alert for rising water, and take
appropriate action to protect life and property. If travel is
required, do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth.
High surf will affect the beaches in the advisory area, producing
localized beach erosion and dangerous swimming conditions.
Swimmers should remain out of the water due to large breaking
waves and dangerous surf conditions.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as jetties and
piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
