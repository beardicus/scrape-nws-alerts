SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Nicole will turn northward through the Florida
Panhandle this evening and into central Georgia as it further weakens
to a tropical depression by Friday morning. Nicole will then jog
northeastward through the Carolinas through the day Friday.
Expect multiple hazards across the area, well north and east of
Nicole`s center. Conditions will remain favorable for a few tornadoes
late this afternoon through much of tonight. Locally heavy rainfall
will continue late this afternoon and through the overnight hours.
Another round of minor coastal flooding is possible with high tides
this evening and again Friday morning. Tropical storm force wind gusts
of 40 to 50 mph will persist in the coastal waters through tonight,
although tropical storm force wind gusts could occur within any
showers that cross the region. Finally, expect dangerous marine and
surf conditions and significant beach erosion to continue until late
Friday.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a dangerous tornado event having possible significant
impacts across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia.
Potential impacts include:
- Isolated to scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution of
emergency plans.
- Scattered locations could experience enhanced damage due to
tornadoes with a few spots of considerable damage, power loss,
and communications failures.
- Scattered locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses,
mobile homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees
snapped or uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed
about.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible
significant impacts across the area. Potential impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with
swifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,
especially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks,
canals, and ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places could experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
Protect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across the region.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
If a tornado warning is issued for your area, quickly move to the
safest place within your shelter. Protect your head and body.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
