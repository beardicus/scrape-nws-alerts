SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Nicole was along the coast of the Big Bend late this
afternoon. A more northward track is expected tonight into Friday as
the storm tracks across southeast Georgia. Remain sheltered through
tonight as Nicole impacts northeast Florida and southeast Georgia.
Life-threatening storm surge inundation was occuring along the local
Atlantic Coast, Intracoastal Waterway and within the St. Johns River
basin. Tropical-storm-force winds will continue along the local
Atlantic coast as tropical-storm-force wind gusts expand across inland
northeast Florida and southeast Georgia into tonight. The local
tornado threat will continue across portions of southeast Georgia
through the rest of the afternoon. Bands of heavy rainfall will bring a
localized flooding rainfall threat to portions of southeast Georgia.
Extremely dangerous coastal hazards including destructive surf and
frequent rip currents will continue through Friday.
A tropical storm warning is in effect for all of the area. Storm surge
warnings are in effect for the local Atlantic coast, Intracoastal
Waterway and the St. Johns River basin.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across
coastal northeast Florida, coastal southeast Georgia, Intracoastal
Waterways, and the St. Johns River Basin. Remain well away from life-
threatening surge having additional significant impacts. If realized,
these impacts include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia. Remain well sheltered from
hazardous wind having additional limited impacts. If realized, these
impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
across portions of northeast Florida and southeast Georgia. Remain well
guarded against dangerous flood waters having possible significant
impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals, and
ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
* TORNADOES:
Potential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across Northeast
Florida and Southeast Georgia. Remain well braced against a tornado
event having possible limited impacts. If realized, these impacts
include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Do not enter evacuated areas until officials have given the all clear
to return.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Quickly move to the safest place within your shelter if it begins to
fail, preferably an interior room on the lowest floor as long as
flooding is not a concern.
If you are prone to flooding or in an area under a storm surge watch
or warning, be prepared for the possibility of a quick and dramatic
rise in water levels.
If a tornado warning is issued for your area, quickly move to the
safest place within your shelter. Protect your head and body.
