SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Nicole was tracking west-northwest across central
Florida late this morning and will be  nearing Apalachee Bay this
afternoon. A more northward track is expected tonight into Friday as
the storm tracks across southeast Georgia. Remain sheltered today and
tonight as Nicole impacts northeast Florida and southeast Georgia.
Life-threatening storm surge inundation will occur today along the
local Atlantic Coast, Intracoastal Waterway and within the St. Johns
River basin. Tropical-storm-force winds will continue along the local
Atlantic coast as tropical-storm-force wind gusts expand across inland
northeast Florida and southeast Georgia into this evening. The local
tornado threat will increase through sunrise along the northeast
Florida Atlantic coast and extend northward across coastal southeast
Georgia into the afternoon. Bands of heavy rainfall will bring a
localized flooding rainfall threat to coastal northeast Florida and
areas near the St. Johns River basin. Extremely dangerous coastal
hazards including destructive surf and frequent rip currents will
continue today and persist through Friday.
A tropical storm warning is in effect for all of the area. Storm surge
warnings are in effect for the local Atlantic coast, Intracoastal
Waterway and the St. Johns River basin. A flood watch is in effect for
coastal northeast Florida and locations within the St. Johns River
basin.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across
coastal northeast Florida, coastal southeast Georgia, Intracoastal
Waterways, and the St. Johns River Basin. Remain well away from life-
threatening surge having additional significant impacts. If realized,
these impacts include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
Potential impacts from the main surge event are unfolding with today`s
high tide cycle.
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia. Remain well sheltered from
hazardous wind having additional limited impacts. If realized, these
impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia. Remain well guarded against
dangerous flood waters having additional significant impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals, and
ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
* TORNADOES:
Potential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across coastal
areas extending inland toward the Highway 301 corridor. Remain well
braced against a dangerous tornado event having additional significant
impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- The occurrence of scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- Several places may experience tornado damage with a few spots
of considerable damage, power loss, and communications failures.
- Locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses, mobile
homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees snapped or
uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed about.
Dangerous projectiles can add to the toll.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
IMMINENT/ONGOING PHASE - Do not enter evacuated areas until officials
have given the all clear to return.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to stay inside and away from windows. Listen for
updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Keep a battery-
powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.
If you are prone to flooding or in an area under a storm surge watch
or warning, be prepared for the possibility of a quick and dramatic
rise in water levels.
If a tornado warning is issued for your area, quickly move to the
safest place within your shelter. Protect your head and body.
