SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Nicole will track west-northwest across central
Florida today nearing Apalachee Bay this afternoon. A more northward
track is expected tonight into Friday as the storm tracks across
southeast Georgia. Remain sheltered today and tonight as Nicole
impacts northeast Florida and southeast Georgia.
Life-threatening storm surge inundation will occur today along the
local Atlantic Coast, Intracoastal Waterway and within the St. Johns
River basin. Tropical-storm-force winds will continue along the local
Atlantic coast as tropical-storm-force wind gusts expand across inland
northeast Florida and southeast Georgia into this evening. The local
tornado threat will increase through sunrise along the northeast
Florida Atlantic coast and extend northward across coastal southeast
Georgia into the afternoon. Bands of heavy rainfall will bring a
localized flooding rainfall threat to coastal northeast Florida and
areas near the St. Johns River basin. Extremely dangerous coastal
hazards including destructive surf and frequent rip currents will
continue today and persist through Friday.
A tropical storm warning is in effect for all of the area. Storm surge
warnings are in effect for the local Atlantic coast, Intracoastal
Waterway and the St. Johns River basin. A flood watch is in effect for
coastal northeast Florida and locations within the St. Johns River
basin.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Protect against life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across coastal northeast Florida, coastal southeast Georgia,
Intracoastal Waterways, and the St. Johns River Basin. Potential
impacts in this area include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
Potential impacts from the main surge event are unfolding with
today`s high tide cycles.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a dangerous tornado event having possible significant
impacts across coastal areas extending inland toward the Highway 301
corridor. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- Several places may experience tornado damage with a few spots
of considerable damage, power loss, and communications failures.
- Locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses, mobile
homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees snapped or
uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed about.
Dangerous projectiles can add to the toll.
Protect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts
across areas west of Highway 301.
* WIND:
Protect against dangerous wind having possible significant impacts
across portions of Marion, Flagler, and Putnam Counties. Potential
impacts in this area include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
Also, protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts
across southeast Georgia and the rest of northeast Florida.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible
significant impacts across Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia.
Potential impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals, and
ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so immediately.
Do not enter evacuated areas until officials have given the all clear
to return.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to stay inside and away from windows. Listen for
updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Keep a
battery-powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.
Do not venture outside during the storm. Remain safely sheltered.
Quickly move to the safest place within your shelter if it begins to
fail, preferably an interior room on the lowest floor as long as
flooding is not a concern.
If you are prone to flooding or in an area under a storm surge watch
or warning, be prepared for the possibility of a quick and dramatic
rise in water levels.
If a tornado warning is issued for your area, quickly move to the
safest place within your shelter. Protect your head and body.
