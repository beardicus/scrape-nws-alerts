<description>...FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM CDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by snowmelt continues.
* WHERE...A portion of northwest Wisconsin, including the following
area, Douglas.
* WHEN...Until 500 PM CDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding on the Nemadji River.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 337 PM CDT, The Nemadji River will continue to slowly rise
as snow melt runoff makes its way into the river. At the gage
located at County Highway C, the river may approach a second
crest level of 25.5 feet today or Saturday and remain near
this level through the weekend.
- At a level of 23.5 feet, the water level is near the bottom
of the County Highway C Bridge. A large area of backwater
also forms upstream of the bridge at this level. Debris
jamming under the bridge is possible. At a level of 26 feet,
water encroaches a house west of the Nemadji River on County
Road C.
Rain this weekend will increase the rate of snowmelt. The
resulting runoff will cause water levels in area rivers to
rise and flooding is expected to continue.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Locations along the Nemadji River in Douglas County.
- Flood safety information can be found at
www.weather.gov/safety/flood.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.

unstable and unsafe.</instruction>
