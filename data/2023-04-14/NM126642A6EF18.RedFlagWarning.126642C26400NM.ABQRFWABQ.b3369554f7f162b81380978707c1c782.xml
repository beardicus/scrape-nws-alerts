<headline>Red Flag Warning issued April 14 at 2:06PM MDT until April 15 at 6:00PM MDT by NWS Albuquerque</headline>
<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT THROUGH 8 PM MDT TODAY FOR MUCH OF
EASTERN NEW MEXICO DUE TO STRONG WINDS, LOW HUMIDITY AND AN
UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM THROUGH 6 PM SATURDAY
FOR THE SANDIA AND MANZANO MOUNTAINS AS WELL AS THE CENTRAL
HIGHLANDS DUE TO STRONG WINDS AND LOW HUMIDITY...
.Critical fire weather conditions will continue through mid
evening across much of eastern New Mexico thanks to above normal
temperatures, moderate to high Haines indices, very low humidity
values and gusty westerly winds. Critical fire weather conditions
will redevelop Saturday across the Sandia and Manzano Mountains as
well as the Central Highlands. Strong northwest winds are expected
to develop behind a cold front and though temperatures are not
expected to be as high as today, dewpoints will lower considerably.
Thus, several hours of single digit humidity values are expected
on Saturday. Winds will decrease late in the afternoon to
alleviate the critical fire weather concerns. However, widespread
critical fire weather conditions are possible again mid week.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM MDT THIS
EVENING...
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM TO 6 PM MDT SATURDAY...
