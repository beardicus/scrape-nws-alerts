<description>...Critical Fire Weather Conditions Again Today...
.Unseasonably warm temperatures combined with winds gusting to
around 25 mph and relative humidity falling to 18 to 25 percent
will produce critical fire weather conditions across portions of
central Wisconsin again today. Very dry fine fuels will promote
quick ignitions and rapid spread of any fire that gets started,
making it difficult to control.
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM THIS MORNING TO 8 PM CDT
THIS EVENING FOR CRITICAL FIRE CONDITIONS FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL
WISCONSIN...
The National Weather Service in Green Bay has issued a Red Flag
Warning for portions of central Wisconsin for low humidity and
gusty winds, which is in effect from 11 AM this morning to 8 PM
CDT this evening. The Fire Weather Watch is no longer in effect.
* AFFECTED AREA...Wood, Portage, Waupaca and Waushara.
* TIMING...From 11 AM this morning to 8 PM CDT this evening.
* WINDS...South 10 to 20 mph with gusts up to around 25 mph.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...As low as 18 percent.
* TEMPERATURES...In the upper 70s to middle 80s.
* IMPACTS...Fires will start easily and spread quickly in these
conditions, so outdoor burning should not be attempted. Visit
the Wisconsin DNR website to view current burning restrictions.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning is issued when critical fire weather
conditions are either occurring now, or are imminent. A
combination of strong winds, very low relative humidity, warm
temperatures and exceptionally dry fuels will create dangerous
wildland fire conditions. Persons are urged to be careful with
any activities that could potentially lead to a wildland fire.
Campfires, outdoor grills, smoking materials, chain saws, and all-
terrain vehicles all have the potential to throw a spark and
ignite a dangerous and destructive fire.
Please advise the appropriate officials or fire crews in the
field of this red flag warning.</instruction>
