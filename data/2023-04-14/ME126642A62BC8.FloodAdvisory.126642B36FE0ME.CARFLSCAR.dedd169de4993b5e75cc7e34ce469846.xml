<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.
Water levels can rise and fall quickly in the vicinity of ice jams.
Those with interests along rivers and tributary streams should be
alert for rapidly fluctuating water levels in the vicinity of ice
jams. Never drive through flooded roads or around closed road
barricades. The barricades are there for your safety due to the
potential for ice jam releases or continued flooding.</instruction>
