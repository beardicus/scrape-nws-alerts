<headline>Special Weather Statement issued July 14 at 8:50AM CDT  by NWS Hastings</headline>
<description>...Strong thunderstorms could impact portions of northwestern Dawson
County by 945 AM CDT...
At 844 AM CDT, Doppler radar was tracking severe thunderstorms along
a line extending from near Stapleton to 8 miles north of North
Platte Airport. Movement was southeast at 40 mph.
These storms are still at least 30 to 45 minutes away from
potentially reaching parts of western Dawson County, and it is a bit
unclear as to what intensity they will have by the time they reach
the area. However, if they do remain severe, a Severe Thunderstorm
Warning may eventually be needed for parts of the area.
Locations impacted include...
Gothenburg.
This includes Interstate 80 between mile markers 209 and 216.
MAX HAIL SIZE...0.88 IN
MAX WIND GUST...50 MPH</description>
<instruction>If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.
These storms may intensify, so be certain to monitor local radio
stations and available television stations for additional information
and possible warnings from the National Weather Service.
A Severe Thunderstorm Watch remains in effect until 300 PM CDT for
south central Nebraska.</instruction>
