<headline>Special Weather Statement issued July 14 at 10:24AM CDT  by NWS Hastings</headline>
<description>...Strong thunderstorms will impact portions of western Gosper and
northwestern Furnas Counties through 1115 AM CDT...
At 1022 AM CDT, Doppler radar was tracking severe thunderstorms
along a line extending from near Eustis to near Medicine Creek
Reservoir State Recreation Area to 8 miles northwest of Indianola.
Movement was southeast at 40 mph.
These storms are still around least 30 minutes away from potentially
impacting parts of Gosper and Furnas counties , and it is a bit
unclear as to how intense they will have by the time they reach the
area. However, if they do remain severe, a Severe Thunderstorm
Warning may eventually be needed for parts of the area.
Locations impacted include...
Cambridge, Arapahoe, Elwood and Holbrook.
MAX HAIL SIZE...0.88 IN
MAX WIND GUST...40 MPH</description>
<instruction>If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.
These storms may intensify, so be certain to monitor local radio
stations and available television stations for additional information
and possible warnings from the National Weather Service.
A Severe Thunderstorm Watch remains in effect until 300 PM CDT for
south central Nebraska.</instruction>
