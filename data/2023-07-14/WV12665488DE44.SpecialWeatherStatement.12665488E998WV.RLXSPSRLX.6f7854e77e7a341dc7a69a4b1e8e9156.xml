<instruction>Frequent cloud to ground lightning is occurring with these storms.
Lightning can strike 10 miles away from a thunderstorm. If outdoors,
seek a safe shelter inside a building or vehicle.
Torrential rainfall is also occurring with this storm. Excessive
runoff from heavy rainfall will cause ponding of water in urban
areas, highways, streets and underpasses, as well as other poor
drainage areas and low lying spots.
Do not drive your vehicle into areas where the water covers the
roadway. The water depth may be too great to allow your car to cross
safely. Move to higher ground.</instruction>
