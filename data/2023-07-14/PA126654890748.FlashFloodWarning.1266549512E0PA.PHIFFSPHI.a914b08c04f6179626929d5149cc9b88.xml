<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM EDT THIS
EVENING FOR NORTHEASTERN CARBON AND NORTHWESTERN MONROE COUNTIES...
At 706 PM EDT, trained weather spotters reported thunderstorms
producing heavy rain. PA Route 115 is impassible in Blakeslee due to
flood waters. Between 2 and 4.5 inches of rain have fallen. The
expected rainfall rate is 1 to 2 inches in 1 hour. Additional
rainfall amounts of 0.5 to 1 inch are possible in the warned area.
Flash flooding is already occurring.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Trained spotters reported.
IMPACT...Flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,
highways, streets, and underpasses as well as other
drainage and low lying areas.
Some locations that may experience flash flooding include...
Blakeslee, Lake Harmony, Arrowhead Lake, Pocono Raceway, and
Pocono Pines.
This includes the following highways...
Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania between mile markers 277 and 294.
Northeast Extension between mile markers 91 and 97.
FLASH FLOOD...OBSERVED
EXPECTED RAINFALL RATE...1-2 INCHES IN 1 HOUR</description>
<instruction>Turn around...don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most
flood deaths occur in vehicles. In hilly terrain there are hundreds
of low water crossings which are potentially dangerous in heavy
rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
