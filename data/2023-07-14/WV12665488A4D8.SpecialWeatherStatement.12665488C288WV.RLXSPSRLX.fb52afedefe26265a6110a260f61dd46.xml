unsecured objects. Minor damage to outdoor objects is
possible.

Summersville, Richwood, Craigsville, Calvin, Kesslers Cross Lanes,
Canvas, Drennan, Swiss, Nettie and Mount Nebo.

<instruction>Frequent cloud to ground lightning is occurring with these storms.
Lightning can strike 10 miles away from a thunderstorm. If outdoors,
seek a safe shelter inside a building or vehicle.
Torrential rainfall is also occurring with these storms and may lead
to localized flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flooded
roadways.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to travel across
flooded roads. Find alternate routes. It takes only a few inches of
swiftly flowing water to carry vehicles away.</instruction>
