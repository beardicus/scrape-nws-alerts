<instruction>Turn around...don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most
flood deaths occur in vehicles. In hilly terrain there are hundreds
of low water crossings which are potentially dangerous in heavy
rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
