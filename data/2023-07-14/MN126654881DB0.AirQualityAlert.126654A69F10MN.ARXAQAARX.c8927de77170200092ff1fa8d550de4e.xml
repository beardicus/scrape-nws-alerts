<headline>Air Quality Alert issued July 14 at 12:08PM CDT  by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has extended an Air Quality
Alert for fine particle pollution. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is
expected to reach the Orange or Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups
category.
* WHERE...Southeast Minnesota.
* WHEN...Through noon Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including
asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults, may
experience health effects.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Smoke from wildfires in Alberta and British Columbia
will move south across Minnesota following a cold front on Friday.
The sinking air associated with the cold front will push smoke
elevated in the atmosphere down to the surface. This will result in
poor air quality. Air quality will gradually improve on Saturday
with gradual clearing across Minnesota from north to south. This
alert may need to be locally extended depending on how fast the
smoke dissipates.
The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has issued an Air
Quality Advisory for Particulates...in effect until noon CDT Sunday.
The Advisory will be in effect for all counties in Wisconsin
including Taylor, Clark, Buffalo, Trempealeau, Jackson, La Crosse,
Monroe, Juneau, Adams, Vernon, Crawford, Richland, and Grant.
Concentrations of Particulates may approach or exceed unhealthy
standards. At this level of Particulates exposure...Members of
sensitive groups may experience health effects. The general public
is not likely to be affected.
For additional information...please visit Wisconsin DNR Air quality
Web site at http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/airquality</description>
<instruction>Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including
asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults, should limit
prolonged or heavy exertion.
Reduce or eliminate activities that contribute to air pollution, such
as outdoor burning, and use of residential wood burning devices.
Reduce vehicle trips and vehicle idling as much as possible.
Keep windows closed to prevent smoke from getting indoors.</instruction>
