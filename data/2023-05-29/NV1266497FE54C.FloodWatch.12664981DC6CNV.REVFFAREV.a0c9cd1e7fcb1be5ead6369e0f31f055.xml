<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM PDT THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH
TUESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of western Nevada, including the following area,
Mineral and Southern Lyon Counties.
* WHEN...From 1 PM PDT this afternoon through Tuesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Area creeks and streams are running high and could flood with
heavy rain. Extensive street flooding is also possible in
urbanized locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Slow moving thunderstorms will produce areas of heavy
rainfall. Soils are already saturated with creeks, streams,
and rivers running full due to ongoing snowmelt. It will not
take as much rain to cause excessive runoff.
- There will be a break in thunderstorm activity overnight,
with showers and storms returning Tuesday afternoon/evening.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action
should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.
