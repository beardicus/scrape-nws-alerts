<description>...Multiple Winter Storms to Impact Holiday Mountain Travel
Tuesday through the Weekend...
.A series of winter storms will bring multiple rounds of light to

forecast to start Wednesday night into Thursday with an additional

prepare for winter driving conditions by packing chains, warm
winter clothes, and extra food and water.
