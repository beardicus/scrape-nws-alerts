<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 20 at 5:03AM AKST until December 21 at 1:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM AKST
TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Snow, some mixed precipitation expected. Total snow
accumulations of 4 to 10 inches. Highest amounts are expected
across the Anchorage and Eagle River Hillsides and along the
Glenn Highway.
* WHERE...Anchorage.
* WHEN...From 6 AM Monday to 1 AM AKST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning and evening commute. Expect
reductions in visibility to as low as one mile.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Light snow will develop across the
Anchorage Bowl Monday morning. The snow may mix with sleet and
freezing rain initially, especially over West Anchorage, as
warmer air moves in aloft. Any mixed precipitation will
changeover to all snow Monday afternoon as colder air moves back
over the region. Snowfall rates are expected to increase late
Monday afternoon and evening in conjunction with the cold air
advection. Snowfall rates during this time could approach one
inch per hour, especially over favored upslope areas such as
along the Glenn Highway and the Anchorage and Eagle River
Hillsides. Visibility along area roads, especially the Glenn
Highway, could be severely reduced if the heavier snow rates
occur during the evening commute due to resuspended snow in the
wake of vehicle traffic. The snow is expected to taper off by
early Tuesday morning.</description>
