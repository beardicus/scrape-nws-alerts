<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 20 at 5:03AM AKST until December 20 at 9:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM AKST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Freezing rain mixed with snow occasionally. Total snow
accumulations of 1 to 4 inches and ice accumulations of around
one tenth of an inch. Highest snow amounts from Sterling east.
* WHERE...Western Kenai Peninsula.
* WHEN...From 6 AM to 9 PM AKST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute. Expect
reductions in visibility at times.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Precipitation will begin to overspread the
Western Kenai Peninsula Monday morning. However, due to warm air
already in place above the surface, a mix of snow and freezing
rain especially for places such as Kenai and Soldotna south to
Ninilchik is possible. For Homer, enough warm air is expected to
move overhead and at the surface to keep precipitation mainly in
the form of rain. Precipitation will gradually taper off from
west to east Monday afternoon and evening.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
