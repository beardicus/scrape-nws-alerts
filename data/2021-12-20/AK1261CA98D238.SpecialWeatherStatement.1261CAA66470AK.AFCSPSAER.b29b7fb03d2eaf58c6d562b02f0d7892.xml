<description>...WINTER STORM EXPECTED TO IMPACT THE SUSITNA VALLEY MONDAY...
Snow is expected to develop Monday morning across much of the
Susitna Valley. The snow is expected to start off as wet snow
before transitioning to a drier, more powdery snow by Monday
afternoon or evening. Snowfall rates are also expected to increase
late Monday, especially along the Parks Highway from Talkeetna
south to Willow, as a colder northwesterly flow develops.
Snowfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches with isolated amounts up to 5
inches are possible. The highest amounts are expected along the
Parks Highway from Talkeetna south to Willow. Slow down and use
caution when traveling through these areas for the morning and
especially the evening commute Monday.
