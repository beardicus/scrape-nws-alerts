<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued December 20 at 5:03AM AKST until December 21 at 3:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY
AFTERNOON FOR THOMPSON PASS...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions possible. Total snow accumulations of
up to one inch possible. Winds could gust as high as 70 mph.
Visibility may drop as low as one quarter mile or less at times
due to resuspension of snow that has already fallen.
* WHERE...Thompson Pass.
* WHEN...From late tonight through Tuesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A winter storm is expected to bring 3 to 6
inches of snow to Thompson Pass Monday afternoon through Monday
night. As the storm moves east of the region, strong
northeasterly winds will develop as colder air works in from the
interior. These winds will likely cause resuspension of
transportable snow, with the potential to produce blizzard
conditions at times through the first half of Tuesday. Wind
gusts to 50 mph are also expected through Keystone Canyon and
across Valdez. Blowing snow due to these winds may reduce
visibility to as low as one half mile or less at times.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Watch for blizzard conditions means there is a
potential for falling and/or blowing snow with strong winds and
extremely poor visibilities. This can lead to whiteout conditions
and make travel very hazardous.</instruction>
