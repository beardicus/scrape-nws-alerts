<description>...WINTER WEATHER WILL RESULT IN MAJOR TRAVEL DISRUPTIONS MID
WEEK THROUGH THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND...
A series of Pacific winter storms will bring periods of stormy
weather to much of California and Nevada this week. There will be
few meaningful breaks in the weather for the Sierra once the storms
begin late Tuesday so plan ahead.
*  Sierra and northeast CA - Winter advisories and warnings are
in place...check with those for snowfall details.
*  Western Nevada - While occasional showers are possible,
substantial spillover is not likely until Thursday. The
heaviest precipitation rates will occur on Thursday and this
weekend. Snow levels are forecast to drop to all valley floors
between Thursday afternoon and Friday morning. Yes, there may
be accumulating snow even down in Reno-Carson later on Thursday
but the weekend offers the best chance for accumulations in the
lower valleys.
*  Consider alternate routes or adjusting plans if you are
traveling for the holidays. This is especially true if you`re
heading into or out of any Sierra locations where chain
controls, long delays, and potential road closures may occur.
Monitor the latest weather forecast (weather.gov/reno) and
check road conditions routinely (511 for Nevada and
1-800-427-7623 for California).</description>
