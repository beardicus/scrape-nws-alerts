<description>...EXTREME COLD AND DANGEROUS WIND CHILLS EXPECTED THROUGH
FRIDAY...
...GROUND BLIZZARD CONDITIONS POSSIBLE LATE WEDNESDAY
THROUGH EARLY FRIDAY...
.A very cold airmass and fast moving storm system will bring
dangerously cold wind chills to northeast Wyoming and western to
south central South Dakota. A fast moving storm system will bring
a quick shot of snow to much of the area Wednesday and Wednesday
evening. Snow amounts will be limited to an inch or two, but
northwest winds will increase Wednesday afternoon, resulting in
extremely cold wind chills through Thursday and Friday. Strong
winds across the western and central South Dakota plains will gust
to 50-60 mph. With new snow on top of a powdery snowpack, ground
blizzard conditions will be possible.
...WIND CHILL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT TONIGHT TO
5 PM MST FRIDAY...
...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY MORNING THROUGH
LATE THURSDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...For the Wind Chill Warning, dangerously cold wind chills
expected. Wind chills as low as 50 below zero. For the Winter
Storm Watch, ground blizzard conditions possible. Total snow
accumulations of up to one inch possible. Winds could gust as
high as 55 mph.
* WHERE...Harding County, Perkins County, Butte County, the
Northern Meade County Plains and Ziebach County. This includes
the Tribal Lands of the Cheyenne River Reservation.
* WHEN...For the Wind Chill Warning, from midnight tonight to 5
PM MST Friday. For the Winter Storm Watch, from Wednesday
morning through late Thursday night.
* IMPACTS...Plan on difficult travel. Widespread blowing snow
could create ground blizzard conditions. The dangerously cold
wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little
as 5 minutes.</description>
<instruction>A Wind Chill Warning means the combination of wind and cold
temperatures will create dangerously low wind chill values. Even
if you are outdoors for just a few minutes, cover all parts of
your body, especially your head, face, and hands.
A Winter Storm Watch for blizzard conditions means falling and
blowing snow with strong winds may produce dangerous whiteout
conditions. Monitor NOAA weather radio, local radio or
television, or the Internet for updates on this potentially
dangerous storm. Take time to prepare for severe winter
conditions before the storm develops.</instruction>
