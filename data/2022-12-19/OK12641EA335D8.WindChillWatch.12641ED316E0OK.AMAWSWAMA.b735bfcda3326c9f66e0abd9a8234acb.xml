<headline>Wind Chill Watch issued December 19 at 10:22PM CST until December 23 at 12:00PM CST by NWS Amarillo</headline>
<description>...WIND CHILL WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT
THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Dangerously cold wind chills possible. Wind chills as low
as 35 below zero.
* WHERE...The entire Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles.
* WHEN...From late Wednesday night through Friday morning.
* IMPACTS...Wind chill values may fall to extremely dangerous
levels. The dangerously cold wind chills could result in
hypothermia and could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little
as 10 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...While the coldest areas may see wind chills
down to -35, all areas will likely have wind chills below zero for
30 to 36 hours straight.  Take this time to prepare for the cold
and have your winter preparedness kits in place.</description>
<instruction>Persons are urged to stay indoors until conditions improve. If you
must go outside, dress in layers. Several layers of clothes will
keep you warmer than a single heavy coat. Cover exposed skin to
reduce your risk of frostbite or hypothermia. Gloves, a scarf, and a
hat will keep you from losing your body heat.
Wrap pipes with insulation and seal windows to avoid loss of heat
from your home. Keep a slow steady stream of water running from
indoor faucets, and open cabinet doors to allow warm air to
circulate around inside pipes.
Keep pets indoors as much as possible.
Make frequent checks on older family, friends, and neighbors. Ensure
portable heaters are used correctly. Do not use generators or grills
inside.</instruction>
