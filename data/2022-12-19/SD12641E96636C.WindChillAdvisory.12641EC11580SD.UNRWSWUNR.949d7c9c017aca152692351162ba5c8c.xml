northwest winds will increase Wednesday afternoon, resulting in
extremely cold wind chills through Thursday and Friday. Strong
winds across the western and central South Dakota plains will gust
to 50-60 mph. With new snow on top of a powdery snowpack, ground
blizzard conditions will be possible.

<instruction>A wind chill advisory means the combination of wind and cold
temperatures will create dangerously low wind chill values. If
you go outside, cover all parts of your body, especially your
head, face, and hands.
A wind chill watch means dangerously low wind chill values are
possible due to the combination of very cold air and wind.
A Winter Storm Watch for blizzard conditions means falling and
blowing snow with strong winds may produce dangerous whiteout
conditions. Monitor NOAA weather radio, local radio or
television, or the Internet for updates on this potentially
dangerous storm. Take time to prepare for severe winter
conditions before the storm develops.</instruction>
