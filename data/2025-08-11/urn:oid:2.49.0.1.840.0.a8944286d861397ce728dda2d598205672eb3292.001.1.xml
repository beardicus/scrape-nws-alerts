        <headline>Flood Advisory issued August 11 at 12:44PM EDT until August 11 at 4:15PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg SC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.

* WHERE...Central Rutherford County, North Carolina.

* WHEN...Until 415 PM EDT.

* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks,
greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and
parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.
A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.  A
small culvert washout or two is possible.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1244 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicated that showers
responsible for earlier heavy rain have lifted north of the
greater Rutherfordton/Forest City area and weakened.  Storm-
total rainfall of 3-5 inches has occurred over much of
central and eastern Rutherford County since about 600 AM.
This is producing excessive runoff across much of the county,
resulting in rapid rises on area streams, especially smaller
streams and associated feeder tributaries.  Flood-prone areas
within the town of Rutherfordton are currently being
impacted, especially near the US 221 bypass project.
Rutherford County reports the following road closures due to
nuisance to Minor flooding:

1) Charlotte Rd near/at Railroad Ave
2) Charlotte Rd near/at Cleghorn St
3) Green St near/at N Main St
4) Green St near/at Cedar St
5) Crestview St near/at Edward St.

Additional areas of concern include. but are not limited to:
1) Crestview Park
2) Norris Recreation Complex
3) Parkway Dr
4) Cleghorn Creek from Southern St following N Cleghorn St,
to near E 3rd St, E 2nd St, E 1st St, E Court St, Charlotte
Rd, the Purple Martin Greenway and Thunder Rd.
5) Bracketts Creek from Duke St to Withrow Rd to Oak St to
Brackett Rd, Washington St, and Blanton Rd.

- Light rainfall is ongoing across much of Rutherfordton
County.  While this rainfall may produce another 0.25-0.50
inches of rainfall, it will not exacerbate ongoing excessive
runoff.  However, it remains possible that additional rounds
of moderate to heavy rainfall will develop over the county
through the mid-afternoon hours.  Given antecedent conditions
and high stream flows, any additional heavy rainfall,
especially if it results in another 1-2+ inches of
accumulation, may necessitate a Flash Flood Warning.  Caution
is advised near any stream or other vulnerable area.  Seek
higher ground immediately if heavy rain develops.  Please
have a plan in place should flash flooding develop and do not
hesitate to act.

- Some locations that may experience nuisance to Minor flooding
include...
Forest City, Rutherfordton, Spindale, Bostic, Alexander
Mills, Caroleen and Henrietta.

        <instruction>Keep children away from storm drains, culverts, creeks and streams.
Water levels can rise rapidly and sweep children away.

Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.

Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.</instruction>
