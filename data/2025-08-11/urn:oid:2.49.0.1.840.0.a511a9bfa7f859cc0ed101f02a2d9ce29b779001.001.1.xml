        <headline>Flood Advisory issued August 11 at 2:54PM EDT until August 11 at 4:15PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg SC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...Nuisance flooding and high stream flows caused by heavy
rainfall are expected.

* WHERE...Portions of eastern Rutherford and western Cleveland
counties in North Carolina.

* WHEN...Until 415 PM EDT.

* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks,
greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and
parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.
A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.  A
small culvert washout or two is possible.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 221 PM EDT, Heavy rainfall has ended across Rutherford
County and additional heavy rainfall is not expected for at
least the next few hours.  However, streams remain elevated
following storm-total rainfall of 4-6 inches, which occurred
between 600 AM this morning and 130 PM this afternoon.
Smaller streams are likely either cresting or have already
crested, but high flows from these streams are moving into
larger streams, which are still rising.  Therefore, isolated
areas of nuisance flooding are expected to continue across
eastern Rutherford County and extreme western Cleveland
County for the next 1-3 hours while the floodwaves move
through the area.  The Flood Advisory will remain in effect
through the mid-afternoon hours to allow streams to crest and
recede below bankfull levels.

Areas of continued concern include, but are not limited to:
1) Duncans Creek near Duncans Creek Rd.
2) Cub Creek near Cub Creek Rd and Duncans Creek Rd.
3) Thompson Branch near Zeno Dr.
4) Taylor Branch near Hollis Rd and Hinton Creek Rd.
5) West Fork Sandy Run near Gardner Dr and Hollis Rd to New
House Rd and Mooresboro Rd.

- Additional heavy rainfall is possible later today.  Given
antecedent conditions and high stream flows, any additional
heavy rainfall, especially if it results in another 2-3+
inches of accumulation in 60-120 minutes, may necessitate a
Flash Flood Warning.  Caution is advised near any stream or
other vulnerable area.  Seek higher ground immediately if
heavy rain develops.  Please have a plan in place should
flash flooding develop and do not hesitate to act.

- Some locations that may continue to experience nuisance
flooding include...
Polkville and Ellenboro.

        <instruction>Keep children away from storm drains, culverts, creeks and streams.
Water levels can rise rapidly and sweep children away.

Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.

Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.</instruction>
