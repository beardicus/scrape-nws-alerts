<description>...Potential Increasing For Heavy Rainfall Across Much Of The
Region...
.Antecedent Conditions...
Over the last three weeks, several heavy rainfall events across
South Alabama, South Georgia, and the Florida Big Bend and Panhandle
have led to overly saturated soils. While mainstem rivers are at
normal levels, smaller basin rivers and streams are at above normal
flows. Moreover, the saturated soils in these areas are primed for
excessive runoff, which could lead to flash flooding, especially
across much of the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend.
.Forecast and Outlook...
A strong Gulf low will develop on Saturday and move rapidly toward
the region. Widespread moderate to occasionally heavy rainfall will
overspread the region. Even though this system will move fairly
quickly, the potential exists for very heavy rainfall to occur in a
short period of time, which could lead to flash flooding,
particularly in urban environments within South Alabama and Georgia
as well as the Florida Big Bend and Panhandle. Some locations could
experience 4-6 inches of rain with locally heavier totals throughout
this event.
While mainstem rivers will respond to these rainfall amounts,
widespread river flooding is not likely, outside of the Ochlockonee
River, where some threat of minor flooding exists. The smaller basin
rivers and creeks are more vulnerable, like the Sopchoppy River in
Wakulla County and Bear Creek in Bay County. These areas, should
they receive 4-6 inches of rain, could easily flood.
.Preparedness Information...
There remains uncertainty as to where the heaviest rainfall will
occur. However a flood watch may be required for some portion of the
area on Friday. Now is a good time to prepare if you live in an area
vulnerable to flooding. If you live in a flood zone, know your risk
and be prepared to take action later this weekend should heavier
rainfall occur.
