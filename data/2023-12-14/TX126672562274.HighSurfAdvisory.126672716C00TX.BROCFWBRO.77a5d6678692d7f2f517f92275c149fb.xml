* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding is expected, with water reaching or
pushing into the dunes on South Padre Island. Vehicles, except
those with four wheel drive and high wheel bases, will be unable
to be driven on the beach. This includes locations north of
Public Beach Access #3. Minor to moderate beach erosion is
expected. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
