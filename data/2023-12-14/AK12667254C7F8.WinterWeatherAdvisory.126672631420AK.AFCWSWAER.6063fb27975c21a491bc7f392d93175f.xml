<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 14 at 3:30AM AKST until December 14 at 9:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM THIS MORNING TO
9 PM AKST THIS EVENING FOR THOMPSON PASS...
* WHAT...Blowing snow expected. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.
Visibility reduced to as low as one half mile.
* WHERE...Thompson Pass.
* WHEN...From 9 AM this morning to 9 PM AKST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Travel may be difficult. Areas of blowing snow could
significantly reduce visibility and result in significant
drifting of snow.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Northerly winds will quickly increase this
morning in the wake of several rounds of heavy snow. The strong
winds will lift easily transportable snow already on the ground
leading to significant blowing snow and reduced visibilities.
Winds are expected to peak in intensity between noon and 4 pm
before before diminishing Thursday night.</description>
