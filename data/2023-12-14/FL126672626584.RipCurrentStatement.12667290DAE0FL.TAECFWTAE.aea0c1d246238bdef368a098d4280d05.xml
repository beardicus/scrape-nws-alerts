<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE SUNDAY
NIGHT...
...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY EVENING
THROUGH SUNDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
For the Coastal Flood Watch, minor to moderate coastal
flooding possible.
* WHERE...Coastal Franklin County.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through late Sunday
night. For the Coastal Flood Watch, from Saturday evening
through Sunday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...With minor to moderate coastal flooding possible,
roads along the Gulf could become flooded quickly and be
impassible. Low lying structures immediately along the
waterfront could experience flooding and become isolated. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...High tide is around 5 am ET on Sunday
morning. While it is too early to specify how high water
levels could rise around the time of high tide, water levels
could rise quickly during the overnight hours.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
