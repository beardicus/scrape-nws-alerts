<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM THIS MORNING TO 6 PM AKST
THIS EVENING FOR WHITTIER...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions due to blowing snow expected. Winds
gusting as high as 45 mph. Visibility reduced to as low as one
quarter mile with whiteout conditions possible at times.
* WHERE...Whittier.
* WHEN...From 9 AM this morning to 6 PM AKST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be difficult. Areas of blowing snow could
significantly reduce visibility and result in significant
drifting of snow.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Westerly winds in and around Whittier will
quickly increase this morning in the wake of several rounds of
heavy snow. The strong winds will lift easily transportable snow
already on the ground leading to ground blizzard conditions.
Winds are expected to peak in intensity between noon and 6 pm
before diminishing Thursday night.</description>
<instruction>A Blizzard Warning means severe winter weather conditions are
expected or occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds
and poor visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout
conditions, making travel very hazardous. If you must travel,
have a winter survival kit with you.If you get stranded, stay
with your vehicle.
