<headline>Blizzard Warning issued December 14 at 5:21AM AKST until December 15 at 9:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM THIS EVENING TO
9 AM AKST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions expected. Total snow accumulations
of up to 4 inches.
* WHERE...Kuskokwim Delta.
* WHEN...From 9 PM this evening to 9 AM AKST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility and result in
significant drifting of snow. The dangerously cold wind chills
as low as 40 below zero could cause frostbite on exposed skin in
as little as 10 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...This afternoon, strong northeasterly winds
will begin to increase over the Kuskokwim Delta coast. Snow will
begin this evening along the coast and then spread inland
through Friday. For areas further inland such as Bethel,
northeast winds gusting up to 30 mph may reduce visibility to
one half mile at times.</description>
<instruction>A Blizzard Warning means severe winter weather conditions are
expected or occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds
and poor visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout
conditions, making travel very hazardous. If you must travel,
have a winter survival kit with you.If you get stranded, stay
with your vehicle.</instruction>
