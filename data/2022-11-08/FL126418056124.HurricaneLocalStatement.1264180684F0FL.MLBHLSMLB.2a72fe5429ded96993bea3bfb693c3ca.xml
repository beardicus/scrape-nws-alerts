SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Nicole, currently around 340 miles east of Vero Beach,
is now moving west-southwest at 10 mph. Nicole is forecast to continue
moving west-southwest overnight, reaching the northwest Bahamas on
Wednesday. Nicole will then turn west-northwest and make landfall
along the Florida east coast at or near Hurricane strength Wednesday
night, somewhere along the Treasure or Space Coast.
A Hurricane Warning remains in effect for coastal Volusia County, as
well as all of Brevard, Indian River, Saint Lucie and Martin Counties,
including the adjacent Atlantic waters. A Tropical Storm Warning is in
effect for all interior counties of east central Florida and inland
Volusia County.
Due to the large area of strong winds extending well to the north and
northwest of Nicole`s center, weather and ocean conditions will
continue to steadily deteriorate tonight through Wednesday. Northeast
winds will increase to 20 to 30 mph with gusts well above Tropical
Storm Force in increasing coverage of squalls overnight.
As the center of Nicole nears the east coast of Florida late
Wednesday, tropical storm force winds will begin to overspread the
region, beginning along the Treasure Coast and spreading north and
inland through Thursday. Hurricane conditions are possible near and
north of where the center makes landfall, which will likely occur
along either the Treasure Coast or Space Coast.
A Storm Surge Warning remains in effect for the entire east central
Florida coast, for the potential of 3 to 5 feet of surge above ground
level. Surge values could reach 6 feet near to north of Cape
Canaveral, and along the Volusia County coast.
Large breaking waves will exceed 10 feet beginning late tonight and
numerous life-threatening rip currents will continue. The strong winds
and high surf will combine with ongoing high astronomical tides to
bring significant storm surge and major beach erosion around the times
of the next several high tide cycles, which will occur between 800 and
845 AM Wednesday morning, from 815 to 900 PM Wednesday evening, 845 to
930 AM Thursday morning and 900 to 945 PM Thursday evening.
Coastal areas of Volusia County which suffered serious damage from
Hurricane Ian remain particularly vulnerable to additional beach
erosion and inundation from coastal flooding! Stay off the beach and
out of the water! Small craft operators should stay in port until
winds and seas subside later this week.
Coverage of showers and squalls will continue to increase overnight,
throughout Wednesday and into Thursday. The stronger squalls will
produce wind gusts well in excess of Tropical Storm force, and up to
Hurricane Force offshore and over coastal counties. Increasing bands
and areas of heavy rain are forecast to product rainfall totals of 4 to
6 inches from eastern Osceola and Brevard Counties north across the
Saint Johns River Basin. Local amount up to around 8 inches are
possible. Farther inland, 2 to 4 inches are expected, with locally
higher amounts. Urban and poor drainage flooding is increasingly
likely, especially where the water table remains high.
A Flood Watch will go into effect for all of east central Florida
starting Wednesday morning continuing through Thursday afternoon.
The combination of heavy rainfall and strong northeast winds could
also cause additional flooding and standing water concerns over the
Saint Johns River Basin, where River Flood Warnings remain in effect.
Some areas along the Saint Johns River which are currently in flood
may reach Major Flood Stage, inundating additional areas. Smaller
rivers and creeks are also expected to rise with additional heavy
rain, with flooding potentially developing Wednesday night into
Thursday.
A threat for tornadoes will develop late Wednesday into Wednesday
night as the center of the storm moves inland across the Florida
peninsula, and continue into Thursday.
Preparations for the significant impacts from Nicole should be rushed
to completion by tonight!!
Take this storm seriously! Your hurricane supply kit should be fully
stocked, and your plan ready to be activated, especially if you live
along the coast, or in an area that is either prone to flooding or has
recently experienced flooding. Always follow recommendations from
local officials regarding any evacuations orders for your area.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Protect against life-threatening wind having possible extensive
impacts across Brevard, Indian River, coastal Volusia, Saint Lucie
and Martin Counties. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some having
window, door, and garage door failures leading to structural
damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed.
Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Locations may be
uninhabitable for weeks.
- Many large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and
roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. Several bridges, causeways, and
access routes impassable.
- Large areas with power and communications outages.
Also, protect against dangerous wind having possible significant
impacts across Lake, Seminole, Orange, Osceola, Okeechobee, and
inland Volusia Counties.
* SURGE:
Protect against life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts along the east central Florida coast from Flagler Beach
to Jupiter Inlet. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible
significant impacts across East Central Florida. Potential impacts
include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals, and
ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts
across East Central Florida. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
For those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,
falling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move,
relocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help keep
roadways open for those under evacuation orders.
If evacuating, leave with a destination in mind and allow extra time
to get there. Take your emergency supplies kit. Gas up your vehicle
ahead of time.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
When securing your property, outside preparations should be concluded
as soon as possible before conditions deteriorate. The onset of
strong gusty winds or flooding can cause certain preparedness
activities to become unsafe.
Be sure to let friends and family members know of your intentions for
weathering the storm and your whereabouts. Have someone located away
from the threatened area serve as your point of contact. Share vital
contact information with others. Keep cell phones handy and charged.
Check on those who may not be fully aware of the situation or who are
unable to make personal preparations.
If you are a visitor, know the name of the county in which you are
located and where it is relative to current watches and warnings. If
staying at a hotel, ask the management staff about their onsite
disaster plan. Listen for evacuation orders, especially pertaining to
visitors.
It is important to remain calm, informed, and focused during an
emergency. Be patient and helpful with those you encounter.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
