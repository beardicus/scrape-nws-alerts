<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued November 08 at 1:28PM MST until November 11 at 5:00AM MST by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>...STRONG WINTER STORM WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY...
.A strong winter storm will develop across the Northern Plains
Wednesday night and continue on Thursday. The expected track of
the storm has shifted further north, with the heaviest snow likely
to fall across far northwest South Dakota closer to the North
Dakota border. While less snow totals are now expected along the
I-90 corridor, strong northwest winds will still create blowing
and drifting snow impacts. Some freezing rain is also possible,
especially across south central South Dakota. Stay tuned to later
forecasts as the track of the storm could shift again.
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY EVENING
THROUGH LATE THURSDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Snow of 2 to 5 inches possible, with locally higher
amounts in the northern Black Hills. The precipitation could
begin as light freezing rain on the prairies of western South
Dakota before changing to all snow late Wednesday night. Winds
could gust as high as 55 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of northwestern, southwestern and the Black
Hills of South Dakota and northeast and the Black Hills of
Wyoming.
* WHEN...From Wednesday evening through Thursday night.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. Strong winds could
cause extensive damage to trees and power lines.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Watch means heavy snow, strong winds, freezing
precipitation, and cold temperatures are possible. Monitor NOAA
weather radio, local radio or television, or the Internet for
updates on this potentially dangerous storm. Take time to
prepare for severe winter conditions before the storm develops.</instruction>
