uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees
are shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown
over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within
urban or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving
conditions on bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* STORM SURGE
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible
- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 3-5 feet
above ground somewhere within surge prone areas
- Window of concern: Begins this morning
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm
surge flooding greater than 3 feet above ground
- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the
previous assessment.

greater than 3 feet above ground.
- PREPARE: Evacuation efforts and flood preparations should
soon be brought to completion before conditions become
unsafe.
- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for
your area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or
needlessly risk lives.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant
- This statement pertains to storm surge inundation up to 6
feet above normally dry ground for areas east of Interstate
95 in Camden County.
- As Cumberland Island is largely National Seashore this
statement will concentrate on mainland impacts.
- Storm surge flooding will flood lower areas of the City of
St Marys. Neighborhoods along and east of Point Peter Road
and Dilworth Street could experience storm surge in some
streets with flooding possible in some homes, This includes
areas near the North River Marshes and areas along The
North River Causeway. Storm surge could flood over Osborne
Road at Borrell`s Creek and across St Marys Road at the
creek just West of Osprey Cove. Flooding is expected across
lower sections of Osprey Cove with some ground level homes
flooded. Marsh Harbour Parkway will likely flood with some
homes possibly flooded. Some flooding along the lower lying
areas of Harrietts, Cabin, Dover and Elliotts Bluffs.
- This is a summary of surge impacts. Not every neighborhood
that will experience flooding is mentioned. Please heed the
advice of local officials.

vulnerable to flooding.
- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take
action may result in serious injury or loss of life.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations
and rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with
swifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,
especially in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams,
creeks, canals, and ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken
foundations. Several places may experience expanded areas
of rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and
poor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on
moving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.
Driving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge
closures.
