SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Nicole is expected to bring coastal flooding,
tropical storm force winds, heavy rainfall, and rough surf to coastal
Georgia and coastal South Carolina Thursday and Friday. Tropical storm
force winds will extend well north of the center of Nicole, with
tropical storm force wind gusts already occurring over the coastal
waters of South Carolina and Georgia.
Nicole is currently expected to reach Hurricane strength as it crosses
through the Bahamas and on towards the southern Florida peninsula.
Nicole is then expected to turn north and then sharply northeast as it
moves over the Florida peninsula Thursday. By Thursday afternoon into
evening, Nicole will accelerate northeast and cross Georgia and South
Carolina.
The risk for flash flooding will start Thursday and persist into
Friday. A tropical storm and storm surge watch is now in effect for
all of coastal Georgia.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant
impacts across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia.
Potential impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with
swifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,
especially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks,
canals, and ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places could experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
* SURGE:
Prepare for life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across coastal Georgia. Potential impacts in
this area include:
- Areas of inundation of saltwater along immediate shorelines and
in low-lying spots farther inland near rivers and creeks, with
storm surge flooding accentuated by waves. Damage to several
buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in normally vulnerable low
spots.
- Moderate to major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching
dunes. Strong and numerous rip currents.
- Minor to moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and
piers. Several small craft broken away from moorings,
especially in unprotected anchorages. Some navigation aids
possibly displaced well off station, creating difficult
navigation near inlets and waterways.
Also, prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across the South Carolina coast.
Elsewhere across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia,
little to no impact is anticipated.
* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia. Potential impacts
include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or uprooted,
but with greater numbers in places where trees are shallow
rooted.
- Some roads impassable due to debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded locations. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways, especially for high
profile vehicles.
- Isolated to scattered power and communications outages.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia. Potential impacts
include:
- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency plans.
- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along with
power and communications disruptions.
- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees, vehicles,
boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and other poorly
constructed structures.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
near the ocean or a large inland lake, in a low-lying or poor
drainage area, in a valley, or near an already swollen river, plan to
move to safe shelter on higher ground.
When securing your property, outside preparations should be concluded
as soon as possible before conditions deteriorate. The onset of
strong gusty winds or flooding can cause certain preparedness
activities to become unsafe.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes
to the forecast.
There is a threat from tornadoes with this storm. Have multiple ways
to receive Tornado Warnings. Be ready to shelter quickly.
