SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Nicole continues to move east and approach the
Bahamas this afternoon and is forecast to move over the peninsula of
Florida Thursday. Nicole is then expected to turn north and then
sharply northeast and impact coastal Georgia and South Carolina
Thursday into Friday.
Although the storm will have weakened, significant impacts from
coastal flooding, heavy rainfall, and rough surf are possible.
Tropical storm force winds also extend well north of Nicole, with the
Georgia and South Carolina coastal waters already experiencing
tropical storm force wind gusts. The combination of storm surge
inundation and persistent antecedent northeast winds could produce
areas of considerable flooding, especially Wednesday and Thursday
morning. In addition, dangerous marine and surf conditions as well as
significant beach erosion are expected.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited impacts
across tidal portions of southern South Carolina and northern Georgia.
Potential impacts in this area include:
- Localized inundation of saltwater mainly along immediate
shorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near rivers
and creeks.
- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread
with surge water. Driving conditions hazardous in places where
surge water covers the road.
- Minor to moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf possibly breaching
dunes, mainly in normally vulnerable locations. Strong rip
currents.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
Elsewhere across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia,
little to no impact is anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant
impacts across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia.
Potential impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with
swifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,
especially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks,
canals, and ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places could experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia. Potential impacts
include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or uprooted,
but with greater numbers in places where trees are shallow
rooted.
- Some roads impassable due to debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded locations. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways, especially for high
profile vehicles.
- Isolated to scattered power and communications outages.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia. Potential impacts
include:
- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency plans.
- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along with
power and communications disruptions.
- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees, vehicles,
boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and other poorly
constructed structures.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
near the ocean or a large inland lake, in a low-lying or poor
drainage area, in a valley, or near an already swollen river, plan to
move to safe shelter on higher ground.
When securing your property, outside preparations should be concluded
as soon as possible before conditions deteriorate. The onset of
strong gusty winds or flooding can cause certain preparedness
activities to become unsafe.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes
to the forecast.
There is a threat from tornadoes with this storm. Have multiple ways
to receive Tornado Warnings. Be ready to shelter quickly.
