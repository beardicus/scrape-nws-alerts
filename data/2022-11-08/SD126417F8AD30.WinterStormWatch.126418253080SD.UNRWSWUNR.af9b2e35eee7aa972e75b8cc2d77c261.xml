<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued November 08 at 1:28PM MST until November 11 at 5:00AM MST by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>...STRONG WINTER STORM WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY...
.A strong winter storm will develop across the Northern Plains
Wednesday night and continue on Thursday. The expected track of
the storm has shifted further north, with the heaviest snow likely
to fall across far northwest South Dakota closer to the North
Dakota border. While less snow totals are now expected along the
I-90 corridor, strong northwest winds will still create blowing
and drifting snow impacts. Some freezing rain is also possible,
especially across south central South Dakota. Stay tuned to later
forecasts as the track of the storm could shift again.
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY EVENING
THROUGH LATE THURSDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...A mixture of freezing rain and snow Wednesday night,
changing to snow Thursday. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 4
inches, with ice accumulations less than 0.10 inches. Winds
could gust as high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...Haakon County, Jackson County and Mellette County.
This includes the Tribal Lands of the Pine Ridge Reservation
and the Rosebud Reservation.
* WHEN...From Wednesday evening through Thursday night.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. Gusty winds could
bring down tree branches.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Watch means heavy snow, strong winds, freezing
precipitation, and cold temperatures are possible. Monitor NOAA
weather radio, local radio or television, or the Internet for
updates on this potentially dangerous storm. Take time to
prepare for severe winter conditions before the storm develops.</instruction>
