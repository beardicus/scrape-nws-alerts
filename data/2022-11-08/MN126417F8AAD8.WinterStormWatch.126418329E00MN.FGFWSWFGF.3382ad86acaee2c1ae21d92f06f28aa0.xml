<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued November 08 at 2:22PM CST until November 11 at 6:00PM CST by NWS Eastern ND and Grand Forks</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY MORNING
THROUGH FRIDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions possible. Total snow accumulations of
4 to 12 inches, with potential for small areas of higher
amounts possible. Winds could gust as high as 55 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of northwest Minnesota and northeast North
Dakota.
* WHEN...From Thursday morning through Friday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute. Gusty
winds could bring down tree branches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Uncertainty remains for the areas that
could receive the heaviest snow and timing and coverage of
freezing rain or sleet. This will create large spread in
potential impacts, and the storm track could still shift.</description>
<instruction>Prepare for possible blizzard conditions. Continue to monitor the
latest forecasts for updates on this situation.</instruction>
