<description>...STRONG WINTER STORM WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY...
.A strong winter storm will develop across the Northern Plains
Wednesday night, lasting through Thursday night. Strong northwest
winds along with significant accumulating snowfall is likely
across much of the area, with the worst conditions expected to be
near and north of the I-90 corridor across western and central
South Dakota. Some freezing rain is also possible, especially
across south central South Dakota. Stay tuned to later forecasts
as the track of the storm could shift.
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY EVENING
THROUGH LATE THURSDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Heavy snow accumulations in excess of 6 inches possible.
Winds could gust as high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of northwestern, south central, southwestern
and the Black Hills of South Dakota and northeast and the
Black Hills of Wyoming. This includes the Tribal Lands of the
Cheyenne River Reservation, the Pine Ridge Reservation and the
Rosebud Reservation.
* WHEN...From Wednesday evening through late Thursday night.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. Gusty winds could
bring down tree branches.</description>
