SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Nicole continues to strengthen in the southwestern
Atlantic as it moves westerly towards the Bahamas and eventually the
Florida east coast. Nicole is expected to be a hurricane before making
its east coast Florida landfall late Wednesday night or early Thursday
morning. Nicole will then move across the Florida peninsula towards
the eastern Florida Big Bend Thursday afternoon and southern Georgia
early Friday morning.
Tropical Storm watches are in effect for the Gulf waters east of
Apalachicola, coastal sections east of the Ochlockonee river, and
inland through the eastern Florida Big Bend from Jefferson and
Madison counties south to Dixie County.
A storm surge watch has been issued from the Ochlockonee river east
to the Suwanee river for life threatening storm surge of 2 to 4
feet. West of the Ochlockonee River to Indian Pass, storm surge is
possible with heights of 1 to 3 feet.
Main concerns from Nicole will be windy conditions associated with the
passage of Nicole, life threatening storm surge along the nature coast,
and localized flooding in pockets of heavier rainfall.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for dangerous wind having possible significant impacts across
the Florida eastern Big Bend and adjacent counties of southern Georgia.
Potential impacts in this area include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
Also, prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts
across the western Florida Big Bend northward through southwest Georgia.
* SURGE:
Prepare for life-threatening surge having possible significant impacts
across the Nature Coast. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
Also, prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts west of the Nature Coast towards Indian Pass.
Elsewhere across eastern Florida panhandle, Florida Big Bend,
southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia, little to no impact is
anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant
impacts across the eastern Florida Big Bend northward across the I-75
corridor of southern Georgia. Potential impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, and ditches
overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
Prepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across the western Florida Big Bend northward to the
Flint River Valley.
Elsewhere across eastern Florida panhandle, Florida Big Bend,
southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia, little to no impact is
anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
If evacuating, leave with a destination in mind and allow extra time
to get there. Take your emergency supplies kit. Gas up your vehicle
ahead of time.
Let others know where you are going prior to departure. Secure loose
items and pets in the car, and avoid distracted driving.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies
kit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your
home or business.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
near the Gulf of Mexico or a large inland lake, in a low-lying or
poor drainage area, or near an already swollen river, plan to move to
safe shelter on higher ground.
Always heed the advice of local officials and comply with orders that
are issued. Do not needlessly jeopardize your life or the lives of
others.
