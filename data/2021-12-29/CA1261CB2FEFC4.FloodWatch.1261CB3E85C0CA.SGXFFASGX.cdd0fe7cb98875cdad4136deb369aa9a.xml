flows are possible, especially near the recent burn scars.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The most likely time for locally heavy rainfall is tonight
and early Thursday. The most likely areas are in Orange and
southwestern San Bernardino Counties where the potential for
several hours of locally heavy rainfall is highest. In the
mountains, snow melt could add to the runoff below 5500 to
6000 feet. Rainfall in Orange, southwestern San Bernardino
Counties is for 2 inches at the coast to 5 to 7 inches in the
mountains. This will transition to 1 to 2 inch at the coast
to 1.5 to 2 inches in the mountains for the southern half of
San Diego County.
