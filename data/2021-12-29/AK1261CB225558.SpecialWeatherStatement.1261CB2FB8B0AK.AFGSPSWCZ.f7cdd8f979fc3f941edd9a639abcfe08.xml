<description>...High Water Along Norton Sound and Yukon Delta Coast Today...
Westerly gales over Norton Sound and the Yukon Delta have caused
sea levels to rise 4 to 6 feet above normal this morning. It
appears that the highest water levels have already occuring. It
is likely that water has pushed on top of sea ice along the Norton
Sound and Yukon Delta Coast, and on top of the river ice as far
as 30 miles upstream along the Yukon river. No flooding has been
reported at this time, but it is likely that some low lying areas
along the coast and the Yukon River have water in them this
morning. Water should recede today as the winds drop off, but
some water will freeze in place today and tonight as much colder
temperatures move into the area.</description>
