<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas, if it is safe to do so. The
rain may trigger shallow mud and debris flows, minor rock falls, and
flooding capable of localized damage, especially in steep terrain in
and near burn scars.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.</instruction>
