<description>...SNOW AND POTENTIAL WINTRY MIX OF PRECIPITATION EXPECTED FOR
BRISTOL BAY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...
Another round of winter weather is set to affect the Bristol Bay
area Thursday morning through Friday evening. Snow accumulations
of 2 to 4 inches are expected for most of Bristol Bay north of
King Salmon as a front moves ashore from south to north Thursday
and Thursday night. Farther south, snow may mix with or
transition entirely to rain, leading to lower snowfall totals.
Some uncertainty remains regarding the exact location of where
this transition will setup, although current thinking places this
between Pilot Point and King Salmon. Within this transition zone,
the potential for some freezing rain will exist. Freezing rain, if
it materializes, is expected to be brief and produce only minimal
ice accumulation before temperatures warm above freezing.
Precipitation tapers off Thursday evening as the front pushes
north into the Kuskokwim Valley.
Thursday night through Friday, precipitation becomes showery in
nature. Low level moisture surging off the eastern Bering will
remain in place as the mid-levels dry out, leading to the
potential for freezing drizzle along the Bristol Bay coast as a
cooler airmass moves in behind the front.</description>
