<description>...TROPICAL STORM BOLAVEN STILL APPROACHING THE MARIANAS...
.NEW INFORMATION...
A Tropical Storm Warning is now in effect for Guam.
.AREAS AFFECTED...
This local statement provides recommended actions for people in Guam
and the Northern Marianas.
.Watches/Warnings...
A Tropical storm warning and a Typhoon Watch are in effect for Guam.
A Typhoon watch continues for Rota, Tinian, and Saipan.
A Flood Watch is in effect for all of Guam and the Northern
Marianas. Please listen closely for any Flood Warnings that might
be in effect for your area.
.STORM INFORMATION...
At 7 AM ChST...the center of Tropical Storm Bolaven (15W) was
located near Latitude 10.9N...Longitude 151.1E. This was about
460 miles east-southeast of Guam. Storm Motion was northwest at 8 mph.
Storm Intensity was 60 mph.
.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
Bolaven continues to approach the Marianas, and the track gradually
has shifted farther north. This places the emphasis between Rota and
Tinian at this time, however little wiggles are still possible and can
really matter. Continue to keep up with the developing situation.
.PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
.NEXT UPDATE...
The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather
Service in Tiyan around 3 PM ChST...or sooner if conditions warrant.
...Tropical Storm Warning in effect...
...Typhoon Watch remains in effect...
...New Information...
A Tropical Storm Warning is now in effect for Guam.
...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
...Probability of tropical storm/typhoon conditions...
Tropical storm conditions are expected within the next 24 hours.
This represents an upward trend since the last forecast. Typhoon
conditions are still possible, however the probability has diminished
since the last forecast.
...Winds...
As Tropical Storm Bolaven (15W) passes nearby, the threat for
sustained high winds should not increase further. North to northeast
winds 15 to 20 mph will build to 25 to 35 mph Tuesday afternoon. Winds
will peak at 40 to 50 mph with gusts to 60 mph Tuesday night, then
gradually diminish Wednesday as they turn southwest.
...Storm surge and storm tide...
Inundation of up to 1 foot is possible as Bolaven passes to the north.
Seas of 16 to 20 feet are possible. Hazardous surf conditions are
possible beginning this evening and continuing through at least
Thursday. The highest surf conditions are expected to begin along east
and possibly south facing reefs on Tuesday as Bolaven nears. Surf will
increase and likely become dangerous for north and west facing reefs
on Wednesday as Bolaven passes to the northwest of the Marianas.
...Inland flooding...
A Flood Watch is in effect for the entire area. See latest
forecast for latest information. Listen for possible flood
warnings for your location...and be ready to act if flooding
rains occur.   Soils are already wet from previous rainfall, so it
won`t take much to cause flooding.</description>
<instruction>For those under a warning...now is the time to rush to completion
preparations for the protection of life and property. Evacuate if
directed to do so by local officials...or if your home is vulnerable
to high winds or flooding.
For interests at ports...docks...and marinas...urgently complete
prescribed preparations according to your emergency operations
plan for tropical cyclones. If you live on a boat...make final
preparations for securing your craft before leaving it.
Regarding any coastal waters under a warning...small craft should
remain in port and well secured.
For those under a watch...continue with your preparations and
listen for possible warnings.
Regarding any coastal waters under a watch...small craft should
return to port or seek safe harbor. Determine the best strategy
for securing your craft.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets
for official storm information. Listen for possible changes to
the forecast.
For additional precautionary and preparedness information...
Please refer to the detailed recommendations relative to your
location as further described by your local National Weather
Service office and local emergency management.</instruction>
