.STORM INFORMATION...
At 7 PM ChST...the center of Tropical Storm Bolaven (15W) was
located near LATITUDE 11.5N and LONGITUDE 149.0E. This was about
310 miles east-southeast of Guam. Storm motion was west-northwest
at 12 mph. Storm intensity was 70 mph.
.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
Bolaven continues to strengthen and approach the Marianas, and
the track has shifted slightly south with a passage through the
islands but still favored to be in-between Rota and Tinian Tuesday
evening. When making decisions, do not focus on the exact forecast
track. Little wiggles in storm path are still possible and can
really matter. Continue to keep up with the developing situation.
.PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
For those under a warning, now is the time to rush to completion
preparations for the protection of life and property. Evacuate if
directed to do so by local officials, or if your home is vulnerable
to high winds or flooding. Heed the advice of local officials and
comply with any orders that are issued.
For interests at ports, docks and marinas, urgently complete
prescribed preparations according to your emergency operations plan
for tropical cyclones. If you live on a boat, make final preparations
for securing your craft before leaving it.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for possible changes to the
forecast.
For additional precautionary and preparedness information, please
refer to detailed recommendations from your local emergency
management agencies.
&amp;&amp;
.NEXT UPDATE...
The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather
Service in Tiyan around 3 AM ChST Tuesday morning, or sooner if
conditions warrant.
...THE TROPICAL STORM WARNING HAS BEEN UPGRADED TO A TYPHOON
WARNING...
...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Keep informed and listen for possible changes to the forecast.
Comply with any evacuation orders issued for your area. If you live
in a corrugated roof home, make plans to evacuate.
Gather clothes, important papers, medicines, and small valuables
and keep them ready to go on short notice. Gas up your vehicles
and have extra cash on hand.
Regarding your home or business, cover all windows and doors with
shutters or plywood. Move patio furniture and other loose objects
indoors. Brace all exterior doors, including garage doors.
&amp;&amp;
...TIMING AND PROBABILITY OF TROPICAL STORM/TYPHOON CONDITIONS...
The onset of tropical storm conditions could start as early as
Tuesday morning. The probability of tropical storm force winds is
80 to 100 percent. The probability of typhoon force winds is 40
to 60 percent.
...WIND INFORMATION...
As Bolaven moves closer, the threat for sustained high winds will
increase, first coming from the north to northwest on Tuesday,
then shifting to west to southwest as Bolaven passes to the north
Tuesday night. The latest forecast is for tropical storm force
winds from late Tuesday morning to Wednesday morning and typhoon
force winds from late afternoon to late evening, peaking at 65 to
75 mph, gusting to 90 mph or higher. A general concern should be
for the possibility of moderate to major damage somewhere within
the area.
...COASTAL INUNDATION AND SURF INFORMATION...
Inundation of up to 6 feet is possible as Bolaven passes to the
north, especially during high tide around 6 PM Tuesday evening.
Hazardous surf conditions are possible beginning tonight and
continuing through at least Thursday. The highest surf conditions
are expected to begin along east and possibly south facing reefs
on Tuesday as Bolaven nears. Surf will increase and likely become
dangerous for north and west facing reefs on Wednesday as Bolaven
passes to the northwest of the Marianas.
...INLAND FLOODING...
A Flash Flood Watch is in effect for the entire area. See the latest
forecast for the most up-to-date information. Listen for possible
flood warnings for your location, and be ready to act if flooding
rains occur. Soils are already wet from previous rainfall, so it
won`t take much to cause flooding.</description>
