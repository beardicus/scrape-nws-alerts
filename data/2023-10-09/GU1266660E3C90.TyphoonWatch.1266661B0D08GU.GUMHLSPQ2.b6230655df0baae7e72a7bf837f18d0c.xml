<description>Corrected time of storm information
...TROPICAL STORM BOLAVEN MOVING WEST-NORTHWEST AND INTENSIFYING...
.NEW INFORMATION...
Tropical Storm Bolaven continues to approach the Marianas.
.AREAS AFFECTED...
This local statement provides recommended actions for people in Guam
and the Northern Marianas.
.Watches/Warnings...
A Typhoon Watch continues for Guam, Rota, Tinian, and Saipan.
A Flood Watch is in effect for all of Guam and the Northern
Marianas. Please listen closely for any Flood Warnings that might
be in effect for your area.
.STORM INFORMATION...
At 1 AM ChST...the center of Tropical Storm Bolaven (15W) was located
near latitude 10.0N...longitude 151.7E. This was about 520 miles
east-southeast of Guam. Storm Motion was west-northwest. Storm
Intensity was 50 mph.
.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
As Tropical Storm Bolaven approaches Guam and the CNMI, the biggest
hazard will be wind damage, followed by flooding, with inundation also
being a concern. It is too early to provide exact wind and surge
forecast values for specific locations. A general concern should be
for the possibility of widespread damage somewhere in either Guam or
the Northern Marianas.
.PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
.NEXT UPDATE...
The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather
Service in Tiyan around 9 AM ChST...or sooner if conditions
warrant.
...Typhoon Watch remains in effect...
...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
...Winds...
As Tropical Storm Bolaven (15W) passes nearby, the threat for
sustained high winds should not increase. However, there is still
some possibility for tropical storm force winds. Since there is
still uncertainty, closely monitor the forecast for any significant
changes.
...Inundation and Seas...
Guam could see up to 1 foot of inundation in coastal areas as Bolaven
passes to the north. If the track should shift south this could
increase. Seas of 16 to 20 feet are possible. Hazardous surf
conditions are possible beginning this evening and continuing through
at least Thursday. The highest surf conditions are expected to begin
along east and possibly south facing reefs on Tuesday as Bolaven
nears. Surf will increase and likely become dangerous for north and
west facing reefs on Wednesday as Bolaven passes to the northwest of
the Marianas.
...Inland flooding...
A Flood Watch is in effect for the entire area. See latest
forecast for latest information. Listen for possible flood
warnings for your location...and be ready to act if flooding
rains occur. Soils are already wet from previous rainfall, so it
won`t take much to cause flooding.</description>
<instruction>For those under a watch...now is the time to prepare your home or
business according to your typhoon disaster plan. Listen for
possible warnings and be ready to evacuate if necessary. Heed the
advice of local officials and comply with any orders that are issued.
For interests at ports...docks...and marinas...it is recommended
that you perform the prescribed preparations according to your
emergency operations plan for tropical cyclones. If you live on a
boat...safely secure your craft and make plans to leave it for
adequate land based shelter. Listen for possible warnings.
Regarding the coastal waters under a watch...small craft should
return to port or seek safe harbor.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets
for official storm information. Listen for possible changes to
the forecast.
For additional precautionary and preparedness information...
Please refer to the detailed recommendations relative to your
location as further described by your local National Weather
Service office and your local emergency management.</instruction>
