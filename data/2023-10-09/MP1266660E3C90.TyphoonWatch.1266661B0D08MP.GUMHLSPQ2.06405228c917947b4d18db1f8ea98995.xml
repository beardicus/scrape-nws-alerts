<description>Corrected time of storm information
...TROPICAL STORM BOLAVEN MOVING WEST-NORTHWEST AND INTENSIFYING...
.NEW INFORMATION...
Tropical Storm Bolaven continues to approach the Marianas.
.AREAS AFFECTED...
This local statement provides recommended actions for people in Guam
and the Northern Marianas.
.Watches/Warnings...
A Typhoon Watch continues for Guam, Rota, Tinian, and Saipan.
A Flood Watch is in effect for all of Guam and the Northern
Marianas. Please listen closely for any Flood Warnings that might
be in effect for your area.
.STORM INFORMATION...
At 1 AM ChST...the center of Tropical Storm Bolaven (15W) was located
near latitude 10.0N...longitude 151.7E. This was about 520 miles
east-southeast of Guam. Storm Motion was west-northwest. Storm
Intensity was 50 mph.
.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
As Tropical Storm Bolaven approaches Guam and the CNMI, the biggest
hazard will be wind damage, followed by flooding, with inundation also
being a concern. It is too early to provide exact wind and surge
forecast values for specific locations. A general concern should be
for the possibility of widespread damage somewhere in either Guam or
the Northern Marianas.
.PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
.NEXT UPDATE...
The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather
Service in Tiyan around 9 AM ChST...or sooner if conditions
warrant.
...Typhoon Watch remains in effect...
...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
...Probability of tropical storm/typhoon conditions...
Tropical storm or typhoon conditions are likely from Tuesday noon to
Wednesday afternoon. This represents a general upward trend since
the last forecast. The onset of tropical storm conditions could start
as early as mid-morning Tuesday. The onset of typhoon conditions
could start as early as Tuesday evening.
...Winds...
As Tropical Storm Bolaven (15W) moves closer, the threat for
sustained high winds is likely to increase. The latest forecast
is for Typhoon force winds from late Tuesday night to early
Wednesday morning. Tropical storm force winds are currently
forecast to begin affecting the area early Tuesday afternoon.
...Inundation and Seas...
Inundation of 2 to 4 feet is likely as Bolaven passes through,
particularly if you are near the center. Seas of 20 to 24 feet are
possible. Hazardous surf conditions are possible beginning this
evening and continuing through at least Thursday. The highest surf
conditions are expected to begin along east and possibly south facing
reefs on Tuesday as Bolaven nears. Surf will increase and likely
become dangerous for north and west facing reefs on Wednesday as
Bolaven passes to the northwest of the Marianas.
...Inland flooding...
A Flood Watch is in effect for the entire area. See latest
forecast for latest information. Listen for possible flood
warnings for your location...and be ready to act if flooding
rains occur. Soils are already wet from previous rainfall, so it
won`t take much to cause flooding.</description>
<instruction>For those under a watch...now is the time to prepare your home or
business according to your typhoon disaster plan. Listen for
possible warnings and be ready to evacuate if necessary. Heed the
advice of local officials and comply with any orders that are issued.
For interests at ports...docks...and marinas...it is recommended
that you perform the prescribed preparations according to your
emergency operations plan for tropical cyclones. If you live on a
boat...safely secure your craft and make plans to leave it for
adequate land based shelter. Listen for possible warnings.
Regarding the coastal waters under a watch...small craft should
return to port or seek safe harbor.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets
for official storm information. Listen for possible changes to
the forecast.
For additional precautionary and preparedness information...
Please refer to the detailed recommendations relative to your
location as further described by your local National Weather
Service office and your local emergency management.</instruction>
