A Tropical Storm Warning is now in effect for Rota.
A Tropical Storm Watch is now in effect for Agrihan, Anatahan, Pagan
and Alamagan.
The latest forecast track for Tropical Storm Bolaven has shifted
slightly north with a passage near to slightly south of Tinian
favored. However, tropical storm to typhoon conditions are still
possible for all of the Mariana Islands.
.AREAS AFFECTED...
This local statement provides important information and recommended
actions for people in Guam and the Northern Marianas.
.Watches/Warnings...
A Typhoon Warning is now in effect for Tinian and Saipan.
A Tropical Storm Warning and a Typhoon Watch is in effect for Guam
and Rota.

.STORM INFORMATION...
At 1 PM ChST, the center of Tropical Storm Bolaven was located near

southeast of Guam. Storm motion was west-northwest at 10 mph. Storm
intensity was 65 mph.
.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
Bolaven continues to strengthen and approach the Marianas, and the
track has shifted north with a passage through the islands now
favored to be near to just south of Tinian. When making decisions,
do not focus on the exact forecast track. Little wiggles in storm
path are still possible and can really matter. Continue to keep up
with the developing situation.
.PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
For those under a warning, now is the time to rush to completion
preparations for the protection of life and property. Evacuate if
directed to do so by local officials, or if your home is vulnerable
to high winds or flooding. Heed the advice of local officials and
comply with any orders that are issued.
For interests at ports, docks and marinas, urgently complete
prescribed preparations according to your emergency operations plan
for tropical cyclones. If you live on a boat, make final preparations
for securing your craft before leaving it.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for possible changes to the
forecast.
For additional precautionary and preparedness information, please
refer to detailed recommendations from your local emergency
management agencies.

Gather clothes, important papers, medicines, and small valuables
and keep them ready to go on short notice. Gas up your vehicles
and have extra cash on hand.
Regarding your home or business, cover all windows and doors with
shutters or plywood. Move patio furniture and other loose objects
indoors. Brace all exterior doors, including garage doors.
&amp;&amp;
...TIMING AND PROBABILITY OF TROPICAL STORM/TYPHOON CONDITIONS...
The onset of tropical storm conditions could start as early as
Tuesday morning. The probability of tropical storm force winds is
50 to 70 percent. The probability of typhoon force winds is 5 to 10
percent.
...WIND INFORMATION...
As Tropical Storm Bolaven moves closer, the threat for sustained
high winds is likely to increase. The latest forecast is for tropical
storm force winds from Tuesday afternoon to early Wednesday morning,
peaking in the evening around 40 to 50 mph, gusting to 60 mph. A
general concern should be for the possibility of at least minor
damage somewhere within the area.
...COASTAL INUNDATION AND SURF INFORMATION...
Inundation of up to 3 feet is possible as Bolaven passes to the
north, mainly at high tide. Seas of 16 to 20 feet are possible.
Hazardous surf conditions are possible beginning tonight and
continuing through at least Thursday. The highest surf conditions are
expected to begin along east and possibly south facing reefs on
Tuesday as Bolaven nears. Surf will increase and likely become
dangerous for north and west facing reefs on Wednesday as Bolaven
passes to the northwest of the Marianas.
...INLAND FLOODING...
A Flash Flood Watch is in effect for the entire area. See latest
forecast for latest information. Listen for possible flood warnings
for your location, and be ready to act if flooding rains occur. Soils
are already wet from previous rainfall, so it won`t take much to
cause flooding.</description>
