<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 25 at 2:36PM MDT until August 25 at 8:15PM MDT by NWS Albuquerque</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 730 PM MDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Arroyo and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of north central New Mexico, including the
following county, Sandoval.
* WHEN...Until 730 PM MDT.
* IMPACTS...Heavy rainfall creating excessive runoff over Canon
Santo Domingo on the extreme southwestern portion of the Cerro
Pelado wildfire burn scar.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 236 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms. This will cause excessive runoff with abrupt
and fast flows developing in arroyos and small canyons with
minor flooding possible. Between 0.5 and 1.25 inches of rain
are estimated to have fallen.
- Additional rainfall amounts up to 0.5 inches are expected
over the area. This additional rain will continue to lead to
a threat of minor flooding.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Portions of BIA Road 89 and Santo Domingo Pueblo.</description>
<instruction>Arroyos, streams, and normally dry rivers can become raging killer
currents in a matter of minutes. Water in arroyos can travel many
miles and take hours to reach your location from upstream rain areas.
Runoff from rainfall will cause elevated water levels within
vulnerable drainages in and downstream of the far southwestern part
of the Cerro Pelado wildfire burn area.</instruction>
