Torrential rainfall is also occurring with these storms and may lead

roadways.
Frequent cloud to ground lightning is occurring with these storms.
Lightning can strike 10 miles away from a thunderstorm. Seek a safe
shelter inside a building or vehicle.
If on or near Canyon Ferry Lake, get out of the water and move
indoors or inside a vehicle. Remember, lightning can strike out to

are close enough to be struck by lightning. Move to safe shelter
now! Do not be caught on the water in a thunderstorm.
Persons in campgrounds should consider seeking sturdy shelter until
these storms pass.</instruction>
