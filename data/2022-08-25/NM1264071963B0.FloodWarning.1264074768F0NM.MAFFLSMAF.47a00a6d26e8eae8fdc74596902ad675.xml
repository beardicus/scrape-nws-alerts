<description>...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in New
Mexico...
Pecos River near Artesia 6E affecting Eddy County.
.Thunderstorms producing very heavy rainfall have produced abundant
rainfall on the Pecos watershed upstream of Artesia.  The Pecos
River at Artesia is expected to rise into flood over the next couple
of days, dependent on a flood wave coming downstream from Lake
Arthur.
For the Pecos River...including Artesia 6E...Minor flooding is
forecast.
...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY MORNING TO LATE SUNDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Pecos River near Artesia 6E.
* WHEN...From Saturday morning to late Sunday morning.
* IMPACTS...At 12.0 feet, the river reaches bankfull.  Overbank
flooding occurs about 1/2 mile upstream from the gage and spreads
onto the flood plain.  As a result, river width increases to
approximately 1 mile in some reaches.  Minor flooding of low-lying
areas occurs, but no significant damage is expected.
At 12.5 feet, the river reaches minor flood stage.  Structures at
Wilbank Trucking, Inc., located approximately 1/4 mile east of the
gage, begin to flood.
At 13.5 feet, the river reaches the floor of the instrument shelter.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...

Saturday morning to a crest of 12.7 feet early Saturday
afternoon. It will then fall below flood stage late Saturday
evening.

11.5 feet on 07/18/1991.
