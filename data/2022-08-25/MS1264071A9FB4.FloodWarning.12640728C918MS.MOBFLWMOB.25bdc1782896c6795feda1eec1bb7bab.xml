<headline>Flood Warning issued August 25 at 4:49PM CDT until further notice by NWS Mobile</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Mobile has issued a
* Flood Warning for...
Northern Greene County in southeastern Mississippi...
Southeastern Wayne County in southeastern Mississippi...
* Until 745 PM CDT.
* At 449 PM CDT, Doppler radar indicated rain has subsided across
the area; however, earlier heavy rainfall has resulted in
continued widespread creek flooding. Flooding is already occurring
in the warned area.
* Creeks and low lying areas acrossed the warned area will likely
remain flooded for the next few hours as heavy rain waters
continue to drain. Culverts and roads will remain under stress as
rapidly flowing runoff may cause continued washouts across the
area.
* Some locations that will experience flooding include...
State Line, Old Avera, Clark, Bothwell, Piave, Avera, Smithtown,
Sand Hill and Knobtown.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
