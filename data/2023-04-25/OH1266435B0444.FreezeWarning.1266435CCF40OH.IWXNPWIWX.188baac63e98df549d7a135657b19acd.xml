<headline>Freeze Warning issued April 25 at 8:25PM EDT until April 26 at 8:00AM EDT by NWS NorthernIndiana</headline>
<description>...FREEZE WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 2 AM EDT /1 AM CDT/ TO
8 AM EDT /7 AM CDT/ WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Sub-freezing temperatures as low as 30 expected.
* WHERE...Portions of northern Indiana, southwest Michigan and
northwest Ohio.
* WHEN...From 2 AM EDT /1 AM CDT/ to 8 AM EDT /7 AM CDT/
Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Frost and freeze conditions will kill crops, other
sensitive vegetation and possibly damage unprotected outdoor
plumbing.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Cloud cover is expected to diminish this
evening, allowing temperatures to drop near or just below
freezing for at least a few hours. If clouds hold on longer
than anticipated, the risk for widespread freezing temperatures
may be lower.</description>
<instruction>Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
