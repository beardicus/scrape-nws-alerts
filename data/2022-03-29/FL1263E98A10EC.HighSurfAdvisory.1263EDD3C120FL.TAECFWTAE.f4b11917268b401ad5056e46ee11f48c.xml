<headline>High Surf Advisory issued March 29 at 4:19PM EDT until April 01 at 10:00AM EDT by NWS Tallahassee</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH NOW IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY EVENING
THROUGH THURSDAY EVENING...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 11 PM EDT THIS
EVENING THROUGH FRIDAY EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM WEDNESDAY TO 10
AM EDT FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Minor to moderate coastal flooding possible. For the
High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 3 to 6 feet expected
in the surf zone. For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip
currents expected.
* WHERE...Coastal Franklin County.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, from 2 PM Wednesday to 10 AM
EDT Friday. The Coastal Flood Watch is in effect from Wednesday
night through Thursday. Water levels will be highest around
times of high tide, which is between 2 AM and 4 AM on Thursday
morning and again between 2 PM and 4 PM on Thursday. For the
High Rip Current Risk, from 11 PM EDT this evening through
Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...Water levels are expected to be highest east of
Carrabelle. With peak water levels of 2 to 4 feet above ground
possible, overwash onto Alligator Point Road is possible, as is
minor to moderate flooding of areas near St Teresa Beach. Due to
accompanying high surf, some shoreline erosion may occur.
Dangerous rip currents are expected and can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
