<headline>High Surf Warning issued March 29 at 12:34PM EDT until March 31 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Mobile</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM CDT THIS
EVENING THROUGH FRIDAY AFTERNOON...
...HIGH SURF WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM WEDNESDAY TO 7 PM CDT
THURSDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 3 PM WEDNESDAY TO 7 AM
CDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking
waves of 9 to 12 feet expected in the surf zone. For the Coastal
Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding expected with 2 to 3 feet
above normally dry ground in the Mobile Bay region and 1 to 2
feet above normally dry ground in the Western Florida panhandle.
For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents expected.
* WHERE...In Alabama, Mobile Coastal and Baldwin Coastal
Counties. In Florida, Escambia Coastal, Santa Rosa Coastal and
Okaloosa Coastal Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Warning, from 10 AM Wednesday to 7 PM
CDT Thursday. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 3 PM
Wednesday to 7 AM CDT Thursday. For the High Rip Current Risk,
from 7 PM CDT this evening through Friday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Breaking waves can sweep
people off jetties and docks, and into dangerous seas. Life-
threatening swimming conditions and significant beach erosion
can be expected. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers
away from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other waterside
infrastructure.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
