<headline>High Surf Advisory issued March 29 at 11:59AM PDT until March 29 at 8:00PM PDT by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM PDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Large breaking waves of 5 to 7 feet with local sets to
8 feet, along with dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Ventura County Coast.
* WHEN...Until 8 PM PDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...There is an increased risk of drowning due to the
hazardous conditions. Rip currents can pull swimmers and
surfers out to sea. Large breaking waves can cause injury,
wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats
near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Gusty winds in the inner waters will drive
enough wave energy to postpone the end of the high surf advisory
until 8 pm.</description>
<instruction>Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
