<headline>High Surf Advisory issued March 29 at 11:59AM PDT until March 29 at 8:00PM PDT by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM PDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Large breaking waves of 4 to 7 feet with local sets to
8 feet, along with dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Los Angeles County Coast and Catalina and Santa
Barbara Islands.
* WHEN...Until 8 PM PDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...There is an increased risk of drowning due to the
hazardous conditions. Rip currents can pull swimmers and
surfers out to sea. Waves can wash people off beaches and
rocks, and capsize small boats nearshore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Gusty winds in the inner waters will drive
enough wave energy to postpone the end of the high surf advisory
until 8 pm.</description>
<instruction>A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in
the advisory area...producing localized beach erosion and
dangerous swimming conditions. Swim near a lifeguard. If caught
in a rip current, relax and float. Don`t swim against the
current. If able, swim in a direction following the shoreline. If
unable to escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
