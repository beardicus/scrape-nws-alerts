<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 26 at 8:53PM MST until January 28 at 5:00PM MST by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>...PROLONGED PERIOD OF HEAVIER SNOW AND HAZARDOUS TRAVEL CONDITIONS
FOR THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS LATE FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...
.Light snow will decrease towards dawn with a lull in the snowfall
expected Friday morning. Snow will increase in coverage and
intensity later Friday afternoon and night with arrival of next shot
of energy and deeper moisture. The heaviest snow will impact the
Park Range, including Rabbit Ears Pass, and to a slightly lesser
extent the northern Front Range mountains (Medicine Bow Range, Rocky
Mountain NP). Additionally, strong winds will be present at times
through Friday, resulting in blowing snow, poor visibility and
treacherous conditions for most mountains passes/roadways.
Lighter snow will impact the I-70 mountain corridor beginning
Friday, and will likely lead to deteriorated conditions coinciding
with weekend ski traffic.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM MST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Light snow decreasing later tonight and early Friday
morning with only 1 to 3 inches through Friday morning. Snow
becoming heavier again Friday afternoon and night. Total snow
accumulations between 10 and 24 inches. Winds gusting as high as
60 mph over the higher peaks.
* WHERE...Rabbit Ears Pass, and Rocky Mountain National Park and the
Medicine Bow Range.
* WHEN...Until 5 PM MST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible from late
Friday through Saturday. Gusty winds could bring down tree
branches.</description>
