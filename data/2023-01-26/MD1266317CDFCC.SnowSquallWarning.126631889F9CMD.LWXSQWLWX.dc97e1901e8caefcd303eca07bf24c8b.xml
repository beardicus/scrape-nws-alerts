<headline>Snow Squall Warning issued January 26 at 6:15PM EST until January 26 at 7:15PM EST by NWS Baltimore/Washington</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Sterling Virginia has issued a
* Snow Squall Warning for...
Southwestern Allegany County in western Maryland...
Central Mineral County in eastern West Virginia...
* Until 715 PM EST.
* At 614 PM EST, a dangerous snow squall was located 7 miles west of
Piedmont, or 7 miles west of Westernport, moving east at 35 mph.
HAZARD...Flash freeze on roads. Intense bursts of heavy snow and
gusty winds leading to blowing snow and visibility
rapidly falling to less than one-quarter mile. Wind gusts
greater than 35 mph.
SOURCE...Radar and webcams.
IMPACT...Dangerous and life-threatening travel conditions are
expected to develop rapidly in the warning area.
This includes Highway 220 between Cumberland and New Creek, and
Highway 50 between Junction and Skyline.
Locations impacted include...
Keyser, Westernport, Bel Air, Lonaconing, Piedmont, Elk Garden,
Kitzmiller, Cresaptown, Potomac Park, Wiley Ford, Rawlings, Barton,
Midland, Franklin, Luke, Dogwood Flats, New Creek, Mccoole, Brady and
Ridgeville.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads,
bridges, and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and
be prepared for a sudden loss of traction.
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.</description>
