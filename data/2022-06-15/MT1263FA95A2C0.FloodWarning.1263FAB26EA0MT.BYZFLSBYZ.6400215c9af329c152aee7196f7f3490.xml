<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles. Do not drive on or attempt to cross
flooded roads, find an alternate route. Roads and driveways may be
damaged or washed out in places. Be especially cautious at night
when it is harder to recognize the dangers of flooding.
Significant erosion is occurring and riverbanks are being washed
out. Please stay away from the rivers as even stable looking ground
may be undercut and fall into the river when stepped on.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency officials and
request they pass the information to the National Weather Service in
Billings.
The latest stages and forecasts for rivers and streams can be found
at our web page: https://water.weather.gov.
The next statement will be issued by Thursday afternoon at 1200 PM
MDT.</instruction>
