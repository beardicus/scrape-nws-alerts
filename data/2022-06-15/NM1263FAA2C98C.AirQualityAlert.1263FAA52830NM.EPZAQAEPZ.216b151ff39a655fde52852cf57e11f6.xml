<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM MDT THURSDAY...
The New Mexico Departments of Health and Environment has issued an
Air Quality Alert, until 1 PM MDT Thursday.
* WHAT...Smoke from both the Black Fire and Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon
Fire will tend to drift toward the east to northeast through the
evening. The lighter and more variable wind conditions in the
vicinity of the Black Fire may cause the smoke to drift to the areas
around Caballo, Truth or Consequences, and Socorro. Impacts from
Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire will be moderate to locally high, and
smoke will be visible with periods of heavy smoke in Mora, Angel
Fire, Sapello, and Las Vegas.
* WHERE...Significant smoke impacts with heavy smoke concentrations
can be seen across portions of Mora County and along the State
Highway 518 corridor between Mora and Sapello. Elsewhere, brief
moderate impacts will be possible at times, but widespread unhealthy
conditions are not expected. More details and the latest air
quality information can be found at https://fire.airnow.gov
* WHEN...This evening through at least 1pm MDT Thursday, June 16th.
* IMPACTS...Those with conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and heart
disease will be especially vulnerable to impacts from poor air
quality, as will adults over age 65, young children, and pregnant
women if smoke concentrations become unhealthy.
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method available
at https://nmtracking.doh.nm.gov/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
https://nmtracking.doh.nm.gov/environment/air/IndoorQuality.html and
https://cv.nmhealth.org
New Mexicans will also need to take steps to keep their homes cool to
avoid heat-related illnesses. NMDOH offers tips here:
