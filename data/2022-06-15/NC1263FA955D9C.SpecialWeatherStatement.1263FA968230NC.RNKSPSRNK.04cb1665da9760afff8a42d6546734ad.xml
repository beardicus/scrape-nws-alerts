<description>...Very Warm and Extremely Humid Today...
An extremely moist air mass was present across the region and this
air mass will remain in place today. Meanwhile, temperatures will
climb into the lower 90s across the Piedmont and into the upper
80s west of the Blue Ridge. Dewpoint temperatures, a measure of
the amount of moisture in the atmosphere, are unusually high for
this region, being in the mid to upper 70s across much of the area
this morning. These high dewpoint values will combine with the
warm temperatures in the upper 80s to lower 90s to result in
afternoon Heat Index Values or Apparent Temperature Values from
95 to 104. While this remains below Heat Advisory Criteria, it is
nonetheless very warm, very uncomfortable, and can result in
heat-related issues if proper precautions are not taken.
Extensive exertion or strenuous activities in such hot conditions
can lead to heat-related illness and problems. Young children and
the elderly are particularly susceptible to heat related health
issues. If you are planning to spend several hours out in the heat
this afternoon, drink plenty of water, try to take breaks in an
air conditioned facility, and reduce time outdoors as much as
possible until later in the evening.</description>
