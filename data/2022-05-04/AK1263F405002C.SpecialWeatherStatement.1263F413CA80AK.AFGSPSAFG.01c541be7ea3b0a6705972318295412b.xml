<description>...Localized Flooding and Elevated Water Levels Across Interior
Continues...
Rapid snow melt is reported to be causing minor flooding of low
lying areas in the Delta Junction area. Areas that currently have
minor flooding will likely have high water remaining for a few
more days. Residents are advised to monitor local conditions and
take measures to improve drainage by keeping ditches clear,
removing snow berms that block surface water drainage and sand
bagging where necessary. Motorists should use caution if water is
observed flowing over roads.
In addition the water levels have risen to near bankfull on the
open rivers and will remain high through the weekend. There
continues to be potential for ice jams to develop as the rivers
that remain mostly ice covered break up.</description>
