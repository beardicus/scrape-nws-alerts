<description>...MORE WINDY DAYS ON THE WAY, WITH COLDER TEMPERATURES AND
RAIN/SNOW SHOWERS FOR MOTHER`S DAY WEEKEND...
--Thursday and Friday--
* A pair of systems brushing through the region will bring gusty
winds both days, with even stronger winds possible on Friday.
Winds will bring travel difficulties both in the air and on the
ground. Travel restrictions for high profile vehicles are
possible. Check with CalTrans/NDOT for the current road
information. Please see the latest hazard text products for the
latest information on anticipated wind speeds.
* Area of blowing dust are possible both afternoons downwind of
the Carson Sink, possibly affecting portions of I-80, US 50, and
Highway 95. In addition, backcountry and ski recreation could
be impacted along with choppy conditions on area lakes.
* A few light showers with minimal liquid totals are possible in
far northern Nevada and northeast California.
--Mother`s Day Weekend into Early Next Week--
* It will remain breezy throughout the weekend, with a secondary
max in wind speeds on Sunday due to a strong cold front. This
front will usher in a much colder air mass and high temperatures
on Mother`s Day will be 15-20 degrees below normal.
* There will be rain and snow showers with the front, but again,
liquid amounts will be minimal. There are solid chances for snow
levels to fall to all valley floors by Sunday evening, which may
catch many off guard, though it is hard to get snow to stick to
roadways in lower elevation valleys this late in the spring.
* Well below normal temperatures and chances for light showers
will continue into Monday and Tuesday next week. While still
some uncertainty due to winds and cloud cover, it`s possible we
could have frost and freeze concerns Sunday and Monday nights.</description>
