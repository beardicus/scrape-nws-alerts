<headline>Wind Advisory issued May 04 at 1:37PM PDT until May 05 at 9:00PM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WIND ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM TO 9 PM PDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Southwest winds 20 to 35 mph with gusts up to 55 mph
expected. Wind prone areas may experience gusts in excess of 60
mph. Southwest winds 15 to 25 mph with gusts to 45 mph and
waves of 2 to 4 feet expected on Pyramid Lake.
* WHERE...Greater Reno-Carson City-Minden Area and Western Nevada
Basin and Range including Pyramid Lake.
* WHEN...From 11 AM to 9 PM PDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Gusty winds could blow around unsecured objects and
high profile vehicles will be prone to tip over. Tree limbs
could be blown down and a few power outages may result. Blowing
dust may locally reduce visibility downwind of dry lake beds and
sinks. Small boats, kayaks and paddle boards will be prone to
capsizing.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Travel restrictions for high profile
vehicles are possible. Check with NDOT for the latest on road
conditions.</description>
<instruction>Now is the time to secure loose outdoor items such as patio
furniture, holiday decorations, and trash cans before winds
increase which could blow these items away. The best thing to do
is prepare ahead of time by making sure you have extra food and
water on hand, flashlights with spare batteries and/or candles in
the event of a power outage.
Check lake conditions before heading out on the water and be
prepared for a sudden increase in winds and wave heights. Consider
postponing boating activities on the lake until a day with less
wind.</instruction>
