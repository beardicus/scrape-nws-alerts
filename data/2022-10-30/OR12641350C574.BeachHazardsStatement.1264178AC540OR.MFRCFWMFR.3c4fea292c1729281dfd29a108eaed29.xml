<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THIS EVENING
THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Moderate risk of sneaker waves expected. These are
waves that have an unusually higher run up on beaches when
compared to other observed waves.
* WHERE...Curry County Coast, including beaches from Port Orford
southward.
* WHEN...From Sunday evening through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Even during calm conditions, sneaker waves can sweep
up the beach without warning and knock unsuspecting people
over and pull them out to sea. Shock and hypothermia can occur
quickly in the cold Pacific waters. In addition, logs and
other debris can be lifted and carried by the waves, crushing
or entrapping unsuspecting victims underneath.
