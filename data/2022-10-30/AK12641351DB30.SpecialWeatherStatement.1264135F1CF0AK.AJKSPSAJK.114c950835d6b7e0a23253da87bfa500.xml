<description>...STRONG SOUTHWEST WINDS CONTINUE TODAY...
A wave of low pressure will track into the eastern gulf towards
Cross Sound by late this afternoon. Along and south of the track
of this low, enhanced southwest wind gusts are likely through the
afternoon hours Sunday. Wind gusts out of the southwest of 50 mph
with isolated higher gusts are likely from Sitka southward to Port
Alexander and portions of the west coast of Prince of Wales Island.
These winds will have the potential to cause isolated power
outages as well as enhanced wave action especially during high
tide. Places that are exposed to wind directions from the
southwest should be prepared for a period of enhanced winds
through Sunday afternoon.</description>
