<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued October 30 at 1:19AM CDT until October 30 at 7:00AM CDT by NWS Mobile</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 AM CDT THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Minor coastal flooding.
* WHERE...Mobile Inland, Baldwin Inland, Mobile Central and
Baldwin Central Counties.
* WHEN...Until 7 AM CDT this morning.
* IMPACTS...Lowest portions of the US 90/98 Causeway at the I-10 Interchange
begin to observe splashover and standing water resulting in
minor flooding around the eastbound I-10 on-ramps. Some minor
flooding of parking lots in that area as well.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Water levels are near the threshold for
minor coastal flooding along northern sections of Mobile Bay,
particularly along the Causeway near the I-10 Interchange. No
flooding has been reported as of yet, but coastal flood guidance
indicates that water levels could possibly rise another half
foot or so by the time of high tide this morning, which will be
generally around 3 AM for sections of northern Mobile Bay.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
