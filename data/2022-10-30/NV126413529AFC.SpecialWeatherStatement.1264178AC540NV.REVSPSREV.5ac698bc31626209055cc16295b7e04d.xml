<description>...EARLY SEASON STORM WILL BRING GUSTY WINDS, SNOWFALL, AND MUCH
COLDER TEMPERATURES THIS WEEK...
* STRONG AND GUSTY WINDS: Winds will increase Tuesday ahead of an
approaching cold front. Gusts of 35 to 45 mph are likely in the
valleys with gusts up to 55 mph in wind prone locations. Sierra
ridgetop gusts may reach 100 mph. Impacts from winds include
road travel restrictions due to cross winds especially for high
profile vehicles, aviation turbulence and shear, hazardous
boating conditions, and patchy blowing dust downwind of dry lake
beds. Wind impacts will diminish behind the cold front Tuesday
night.
* SNOW IMPACTS: The first impactful snowfall of the season looks
to occur with this storm. Early in the day Tuesday,
precipitation will likely start out as snow above 6,000 feet as
the main band pushes into northwestern Nevada. Rain or a
rain/snow mix will be possible below this elevation. While snow
levels may rise close to 7,000 feet Tuesday afternoon, they will
quickly fall to valley floors by Wednesday morning. Snow
showers may continue to impact roadways through early Thursday
morning. Be prepared for slow downs and delays with slick roads.
* MUCH COLDER TEMPERATURES: The cold airmass will bring the
season`s coldest temperatures so far. High temperatures will
plummet some 15-20 degrees below average on Wednesday and
Thursday - struggling to get out of the 30s in the Sierra
valleys and 40s across western Nevada. Brisk, northerly breezes
will keep it feeling cold through Thursday afternoon. Hard
freezes are likely, particularly Thursday and Friday mornings as
skies clear out. Teens and single digits will be common in
Sierra valleys while colder spots like Bridgeport and Bodie may
see sub-zero temperatures. Finish up winter protections for
exposed irrigation equipment if you have not done so already.</description>
