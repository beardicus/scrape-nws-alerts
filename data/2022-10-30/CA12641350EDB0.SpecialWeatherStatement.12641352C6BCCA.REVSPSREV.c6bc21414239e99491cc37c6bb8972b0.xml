<description>...EARLY SEASON STORM SYSTEM WILL BRING GUSTY WINDS, SNOWFALL,
AND MUCH COLDER TEMPERATURES THIS WEEK...
* STRONG AND GUSTY WINDS: Winds will increase Tuesday ahead of an
approaching cold front. Gusts of 35 to 45 mph are likely in the
valleys with gusts up to 55 mph in wind prone locations. Sierra
ridgetop gusts could reach 100 mph. Impacts from winds include
road travel restrictions due to cross winds especially for high
profile vehicles, aviation turbulence and shear, hazardous
boating conditions, and patchy blowing dust downwind of dry lake
beds. Wind impacts will diminish behind the front Tuesday night.
* SNOW IMPACTS: The first impactful snowfall of the season looks
to occur with this system. Early in the day Tuesday,
precipitation will likely start out as snow above 6,000 feet as
the main band pushes into northeastern California and the
Sierra. Rain or a rain/snow mix will be possible below this
elevation. While snow levels may rise close to 7,000 feet
Tuesday afternoon, they will quickly fall to valley floors by
Wednesday morning. Snow showers may continue to impact
northeastern California and western Nevada roadways through
Wednesday night. Be prepared to carry chains and expect longer
commute times if you plan on venturing into the Sierra during
the middle part of the week.
* MUCH COLDER TEMPERATURES: The cold airmass will likely usher in
the season`s coldest temperatures thus far. High temperatures
will plummet some 15-20 degrees below average on Wednesday and
Thursday - struggling to get out of the 30s in the Sierra
valleys and 40s across western Nevada. With northerly breezes
still in place, it will feel brisk out, even during the
afternoon hours. Hard freezes are likely, particularly Thursday
and Friday mornings as skies clear. Teens and single digits will
be common in Sierra valleys while colder spots like Bridgeport
and Bodie may see sub-zero temperatures. Now is the time to
complete winter protections for exposed irrigation equipment if
you have not done so already.</description>
