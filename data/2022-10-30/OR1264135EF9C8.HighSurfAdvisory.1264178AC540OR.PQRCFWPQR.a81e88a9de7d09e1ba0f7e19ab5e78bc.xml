<headline>High Surf Advisory issued October 30 at 7:10PM PDT until October 31 at 5:00PM PDT by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 11 PM THIS EVENING
TO 5 PM PDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Large waves and hazardous surf conditions. Breakers up
to 27 feet.
* WHERE...In Oregon, North Oregon Coast and Central Oregon Coast
Counties. In Washington, South Washington Coast County.
* WHEN...From 11 PM Sunday evening to 5 PM PDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Destructive waves may wash over beaches, jetties,
and other structures unexpectedly. People can be swept off
rocks and jetties and drown while observing high surf. Minor
beach erosion may damage coastal properties and buildings.
Higher than normal water run-up is expected on beaches and low-
lying shoreline.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...High surf will be generated from a distant
storm in the Gulf of Alaska. Incoming swells will come from the
West-Northwest.</description>
<instruction>A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches,
producing rip currents, sneaker waves and beach erosion. Stay
well back from the water`s edge and be alert for exceptionally
high waves.
Keep away from large logs on the beach. Water running up on the
beach can easily lift or roll logs which can injure or kill
someone caught in their path.</instruction>
