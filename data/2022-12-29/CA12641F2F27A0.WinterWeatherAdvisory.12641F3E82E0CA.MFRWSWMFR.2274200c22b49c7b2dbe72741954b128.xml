<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 29 at 1:36PM PST until December 30 at 2:00PM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 PM PST
FRIDAY ABOVE 3000 FEET...
* WHAT...Wet snow expected, with total accumulations of 3 to 9
inches. Winds gusting as high as 40-45 mph in the Warner
Mountains and 30-35 mph at lower elevations.
* WHERE...Modoc County, mostly the higher terrain, including the
Warner Mountains and a portion of highway 299 at Cedar Pass.
This also includes Willow Ranch and a portion of highway 395.
* WHEN...For only the Warner Mountains- from 4 PM this afternoon
to 2 PM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be difficult. Blowing snow could
significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions
could impact the evening commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The snow level starts out around 4500
feet and snow over much of the county is expected too. Then by
around 10 PM PST the snow level rises to around 5500 feet and
the snow will largely be contained to the mountains. The snow
level should hover between 5500 and 6000 feet through late
Friday morning, then remain around 6000 feet through Friday
evening. For this reason, the Warner Mountains specifically,
remain under the advisory through 2 PM PST, when all other
areas have the advisory ending early in the day on Friday.

* Carry tire chains and be prepared for snow covered roads and
limited visibilities.
* A Winter Weather Advisory for snow means that periods of snow
will cause travel difficulties.</instruction>
