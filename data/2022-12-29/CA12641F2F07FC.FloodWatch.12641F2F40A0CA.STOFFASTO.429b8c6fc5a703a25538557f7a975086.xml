<headline>Flood Watch issued December 29 at 12:55PM PST until December 29 at 2:00PM PST by NWS Sacramento</headline>
<description>.Heavy rainfall associated an incoming atmospheric river will result
in increased potential for areal, small stream, and river flooding
across much of northern California. As a result, a Flood Watch
remains in effect.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH LATE
SATURDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of northern California, including the following
areas, Carquinez Strait and Delta, Central Sacramento Valley,
Motherlode, Northeast Foothills/Sacramento Valley, Northern San
Joaquin Valley and Southern Sacramento Valley.
* WHEN...From Friday afternoon through late Saturday night.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water crossings may be
flooded. Storm drains and ditches may become clogged with debris.
Extensive street flooding and flooding of creeks and rivers are
possible. Area creeks and streams are running high and could flood
with more heavy rain. Area weirs including Tisdale, Fremont, and
Colusa will also likely flow. Mokelumne River at Benson`s Ferry
and Cosumnes River at McConnel and Michigan Bar may reach monitor
and flood stage respectively late Saturday in response to heavy
rain.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings and Advisories. Those living in areas prone to flooding
should be prepared to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
