<description>...Significant Storm Moving through Western Nevada New Year
Weekend...
A significant storm will impact western Nevada Friday through
Sunday morning with gusty winds and rain. The weather pattern will
remain active through the first week of 2023 with cold storms an
potential for snow accumulations on valley floors.
* Winds, which may be strong at times, will precede rainfall
across the region Friday afternoon into Saturday. Localized
gusts could exceed 60 mph and impact travel for high profile
vehicles.
* The heaviest rain will move through western Nevada early
Saturday morning into Saturday evening. Be prepared for flood
impacts near creeks, streams, ditches, urban areas, and poorly
drained locations. Be cautious traveling about the region,
especially at night when flood waters are more difficult to see.
* Conditions will turn colder near the end of the storm Saturday
night and Sunday morning. A period of snow is possible Saturday
night as low as 5000 feet with a couple of inches of slushy
accumulations on roads. Temperatures are forecast to fall to
near or below freezing Sunday morning which could freeze wet
roads and form areas of black ice.</description>
