<headline>Lakeshore Flood Warning issued March 03 at 3:45PM EST until March 04 at 4:00AM EST by NWS Detroit</headline>
<description>...LAKESHORE FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM EST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Significant lakeshore flooding.
* WHERE...Monroe County.
* WHEN...Until 4 AM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Numerous roads closed and low lying property
including parking lots, lawns, and homes and businesses will
be inundated near the lake. Some shoreline erosion will occur.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...East to northeast gales of around 35 knots
with gusts to 40 knots at times and waves of 6 to 8 feet are
anticipated in the western basin of Lake Erie through this
evening. As a result, water levels at Toledo are expected to
rise above 72 inches above low water datum during that time. For
Monroe County, the greatest water level rises and chance for
lakeshore flooding will be in the southeastern portion of the
county. However, lakeshore flooding will still be possible along
all shoreline areas of the county.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
