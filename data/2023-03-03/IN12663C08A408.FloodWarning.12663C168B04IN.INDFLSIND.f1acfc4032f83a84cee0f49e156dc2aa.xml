<description>...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in

Wabash River.
.Rainfall amounts of one and a half to two and a half inches with
locally higher amounts throughout the day today will bring
additional lowland flooding with higher crests along the Wabash and
its tributaries, as well as bring lowland flooding to much of the

Locally higher amounts in a particular basin could introduce some
moderate flooding, and although none is currently forecast, those

the forecast over the next 24 hours. The crest on the Wabash is

Wabash continuing through next week. Most locations on the upper

stay from Saturday afternoon through Monday afternoon.
