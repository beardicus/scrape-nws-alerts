<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 03 at 11:12PM EST until March 04 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...SIGNIFICANT SNOWSTORM TONIGHT INTO SATURDAY...
.A winter storm is tracking across the Northeast late this evening
with a secondary area of low pressure developing along the southern
New England coast by early Saturday. A band of heavy snowfall is
presently lifting northward through southern New England with snow
breaking out across New Hampshire at this late evening hour... and
expected to expand across the forecast area through the overnight
hours. The bulk of the snowfall accumulation is expected with this
band, though additional accumulation is expected through midday
Saturday as low pressure drifts east and reinvigorates near the
coast. Some sleet may mix in across parts of southern New Hampshire
and could reduce snowfall totals slightly compared to the rest of
the area. Wet snow may also fall along the coasts of Maine and New
Hampshire. Additionally, strong gusty winds along the coastal plain
and into the interior are expected. When combined with wet snow,
this may lead to power outages and when combined with drier snow,
would produce localized whiteout conditions.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 9 and
12 inches. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of south central, southwest, and western Maine.
Portions of northern New Hampshire.
* WHEN...Until 7 PM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Significant snowfall with the potential for a foot plus
of snow inland will bring a period of impacts. Moderate snow with
periods of heavy snow will create hazardous travel conditions
across the region. The potential exists for snow banding that will
bring periods of locally heavy snowfall, which will lead to rapid
snow accumulations and extremely dangerous travel conditions. The
combination of heavy wet snow and gusty winds near the coast will
lead to snapped branches and a few downed trees. Widespread to
numerous power outages likely. Localized whiteouts are possible
into the interior where drier snow may blow and drift more readily.</description>
