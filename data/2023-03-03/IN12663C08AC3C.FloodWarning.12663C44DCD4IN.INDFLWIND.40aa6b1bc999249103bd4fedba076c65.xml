Flood Warning for the following rivers in Indiana...
White River from Nora through Hazleton.

.Rainfall amounts of one and a half to two and a half inches with
locally higher amounts throughout the day today will bring
additional lowland flooding with higher crests along the Wabash and
its tributaries, as well as bring lowland flooding to much of the

Locally higher amounts in a particular basin could introduce some
moderate flooding, and although none is currently forecast, those
with interests along area rivers should maintain a close watch on
the forecast over the next 24 hours. The crest on the Wabash is

Wabash continuing through next week. Most locations on the upper
White are forecast to crest Saturday evening through Sunday morning,
