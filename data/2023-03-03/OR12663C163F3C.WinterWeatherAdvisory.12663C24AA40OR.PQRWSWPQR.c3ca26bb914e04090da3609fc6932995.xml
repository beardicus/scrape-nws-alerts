<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM PST
SATURDAY ABOVE 1000 FEET...

* WHEN...Until 4 PM PST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow levels are expected to reach between
500 and 1000 feet late Friday night and continue through
Saturday morning. This means the most likely outcome for the
