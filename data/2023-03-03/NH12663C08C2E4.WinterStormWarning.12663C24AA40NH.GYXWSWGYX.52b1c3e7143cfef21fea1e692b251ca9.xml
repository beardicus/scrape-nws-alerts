<description>...SIGNIFICANT SNOWSTORM FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY...
.A winter storm is forecast to move into the eastern Great Lakes
today with a secondary area of low pressure developing along the
southern New England coast by Saturday. A band of heavy snowfall is
expected to lift northeast ahead of the storm, reaching southern New
Hampshire Friday evening and spreading north through the overnight.
The bulk of the snowfall accumulation is expected with this band,
though additional accumulation is expected through midday Saturday
as low pressure drifts east. Some sleet may mix in across parts of
southern New Hampshire and could reduce snowfall totals slightly
compared to the rest of the area. Wet snow may also fall along the
coasts of Maine and New Hampshire.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM TO 7 PM EST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 10
and 13 inches. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of southwest and western Maine. Portions of
northern New Hampshire.
* WHEN...From 1 AM to 7 PM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Significant snowfall with the potential for a foot plus
of snow will bring a period of impacts. Moderate snow with periods
of heavy snow will create hazardous travel conditions across the
region. The potential exists for snowbands that will bring periods
of locally heavy snowfall, which will lead to rapid snow
accumulations and extremely dangerous travel conditions. The
combination of heavy wet snow and gusty winds will lead to snapped
branches. Isolated to scattered power outages likely.</description>
