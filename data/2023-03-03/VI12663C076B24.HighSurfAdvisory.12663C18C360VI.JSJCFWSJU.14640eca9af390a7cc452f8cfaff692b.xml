<headline>High Surf Advisory issued March 03 at 4:33AM AST until March 04 at 6:00PM AST by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE SATURDAY
NIGHT...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Dangerous surf conditions and rip currents expected due
to breaking waves up to around 10 feet. Localized beach
erosion is possible.
* WHERE...North and east facing beaches of St. Croix.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, from this morning, to 6 PM
AST Saturday. For the High Rip Current Risk, currently in effect
through at least late Saturday night.
* IMPACTS...Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper waters.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.</instruction>
