<description>...SIGNIFICANT SNOWSTORM FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY...
.A winter storm is forecast to move into the eastern Great Lakes
today with a secondary area of low pressure developing along the
southern New England coast by Saturday. A band of heavy snowfall is
expected to lift northeast ahead of the storm, reaching southern New
Hampshire Friday evening and spreading north through the overnight.
The bulk of the snowfall accumulation is expected with this band,
though additional accumulation is expected through midday Saturday
as low pressure drifts east. Some sleet may mix in across parts of
southern New Hampshire and could reduce snowfall totals slightly
compared to the rest of the area. Wet snow may also fall along the
coasts of Maine and New Hampshire.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM TO 7 PM EST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 3 and 6
inches.
* WHERE...Central Somerset County.
* WHEN...From 4 AM to 7 PM EST Saturday.

region. Although snowfall amounts will be light to moderate,
travel will still be impacted due to snowfall accumulations on
roads.</description>
