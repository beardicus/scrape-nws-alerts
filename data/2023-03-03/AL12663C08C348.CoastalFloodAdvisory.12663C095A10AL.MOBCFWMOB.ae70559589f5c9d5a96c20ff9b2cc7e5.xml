<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued March 03 at 11:14AM CST until March 03 at 3:00PM CST by NWS Mobile</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 PM CST THIS
AFTERNOON...
...HIGH SURF WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT CST
TONIGHT...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking
waves of 6 to 9 feet, with locally higher waves up to 10 feet
in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal
flooding. For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Mobile Coastal County.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Warning, until midnight CST tonight.
For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 3 PM CST this afternoon.
For the High Rip Current Risk, through Sunday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Breaking waves can sweep
people off jetties and docks, and into dangerous seas. Life-
threatening swimming conditions and significant beach erosion
can be expected. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers
away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Some splash up onto Shell Belt and Coden
Belt Roads can occur causing minor coastal flooding, but roads
generally remain open.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other waterside
infrastructure.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
