<description>...SIGNIFICANT SNOWSTORM TONIGHT INTO SATURDAY...
.A winter storm is tracking across the Northeast late this evening
with a secondary area of low pressure developing along the southern
New England coast by early Saturday. A band of heavy snowfall is
presently lifting northward through southern New England with snow
breaking out across New Hampshire at this late evening hour... and
expected to expand across the forecast area through the overnight
hours. The bulk of the snowfall accumulation is expected with this
band, though additional accumulation is expected through midday
Saturday as low pressure drifts east and reinvigorates near the
coast. Some sleet may mix in across parts of southern New Hampshire
and could reduce snowfall totals slightly compared to the rest of
the area. Wet snow may also fall along the coasts of Maine and New
Hampshire. Additionally, strong gusty winds along the coastal plain
and into the interior are expected. When combined with wet snow,
this may lead to power outages and when combined with drier snow,
would produce localized whiteout conditions.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM TO 7 PM EST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 3 and 6
inches.
* WHERE...Southern Somerset, Central Somerset, and Northern Franklin
Counties.
* WHEN...From 4 AM to 7 PM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...A weather system will bring a period of snowfall to the
region. Although snowfall amounts will be light to moderate,
travel will still be impacted due to snowfall accumulations on
roads.</description>
