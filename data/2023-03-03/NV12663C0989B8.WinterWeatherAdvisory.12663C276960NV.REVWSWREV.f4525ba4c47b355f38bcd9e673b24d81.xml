<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued March 03 at 2:22PM PST until March 05 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM SATURDAY TO
10 AM PST SUNDAY...
* CHANGES...Moved the start time of the advisory up to 1 pm.
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 2 to 6
inches, except 6 to 10 inches above 5000 feet. Winds gusting
as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Greater Reno-Carson City-Minden Area.
* WHEN...From 1 PM Saturday to 10 AM PST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Strong winds may
produce near-zero visibility at times, cause tree damage and
lead to some power outages.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The first round of spillover will occur
Saturday afternoon and evening, with a second round starting
before daybreak Sunday. Spotty snow showers may occur between
these heavier waves of snow.</description>
<instruction>This snow could produce major travel challenges, especially at
night when poor visibility due to blowing and drifting snow is
more likely. Be sure to allow extra time to reach your
destination. Leave extra space between vehicles since it takes
longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
