<headline>Flood Warning issued March 03 at 9:36PM EST until March 05 at 4:00AM EST by NWS Wilmington</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM EST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...A portion of West Central Ohio, including the following
counties, Auglaize, Darke, Mercer and Shelby.
* WHEN...Until 900 AM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is occurring. Streams continue to rise,
or may be slow to recede, due to excess runoff from earlier
rainfall. Low-water crossings are inundated with water and may not
be passable.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 934 PM EST, local law enforcement reported flooding in
numerous locations across the warned area, with several roads
still closed due to lingering high water. Between 1.5 and 2.5
inches of rain have fallen. Little to no additional rainfall
is expected.

Sidney, Celina, Wapakoneta, St. Marys, Coldwater, Fort
Shawnee, New Bremen, Minster, Versailles, St. Henry, Newport,
Cridersville, Union City, Anna, Fort Loramie, Jackson Center,
Fort Recovery, Ansonia, Botkins and Rockford.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.

dangers of flooding.

your report via social media, when you can do so safely.</instruction>
