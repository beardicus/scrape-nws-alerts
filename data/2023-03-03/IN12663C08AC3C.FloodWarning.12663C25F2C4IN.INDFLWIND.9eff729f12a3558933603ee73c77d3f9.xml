Flood Warning for the following rivers in Indiana...
White River from Nora through Hazleton.

.Rainfall amounts of one and a half to two and a half inches with
locally higher amounts throughout the day today will bring
additional lowland flooding with higher crests along the Wabash and
its tributaries, as well as bring lowland flooding to much of the

Locally higher amounts in a particular basin could introduce some
moderate flooding, and although none is currently forecast, those
