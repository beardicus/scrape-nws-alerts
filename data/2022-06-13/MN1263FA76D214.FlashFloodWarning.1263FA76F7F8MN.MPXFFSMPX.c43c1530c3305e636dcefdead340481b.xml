<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued June 13 at 10:33AM CDT until June 13 at 11:30AM CDT by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1130 AM CDT THIS
MORNING FOR NORTHERN STEELE AND EAST CENTRAL WASECA COUNTIES...
At 1033 AM CDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing
heavy rain across the warned area. Between 2 and 4 inches of rain
have fallen. Although the initial round of heavy rain has moved out,
there is another batch of rain with embedded heavy downpours that
extends back across Blue Earth county to nearly St. James. This
additional rainfall will move through the warned area over the next
hour, which will likely allow any high water that had begun to
recede to rise again.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,
highways, streets and underpasses as well as other poor
drainage and low-lying areas.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...

Airport.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
EXPECTED RAINFALL RATE...1-2 INCHES IN 1 HOUR AND 30 MINUTES</description>
