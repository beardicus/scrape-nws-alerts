<headline>Flood Warning issued June 13 at 11:24AM MDT until June 14 at 3:00PM MDT by NWS Billings</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in Montana...
Boulder River at Big Timber affecting Sweet Grass County.
.Combination of rainfall and melting snow is expected to push the
Boulder River above flood stage. How far above flood stage the
Boulder River will rise is hard to determine due to uncertainties
with the rain falling on the snow in the high country. As a result
the forecast crest should be used as a starting point and not a
definite peak. If you live or are recreating along the river be
prepared for flooding. Additional updates to the river forecast and
warning will be updated as more information becomes available.
For the Boulder River...including Big Timber...Minor flooding is
forecast.

- Forecast...The river will oscillate above flood stage with a
