<headline>Flood Warning issued June 13 at 10:19AM MDT until June 15 at 12:00AM MDT by NWS Billings</headline>
<description>...Unprecedented flooding occurring on the following rivers in
Montana...
Yellowstone River at Corwin Springs affecting Park County.
.Heavy rain falling on the snowpack over the southern
Beartooth/Absaroka mountains has resulted in unprecedented rises on
the Yellowstone River at Corwin Springs. The river is currently
higher than has ever been recorded, far surpassing the 1918 record
crest, and continues to rise. How far above flood stage the
Yellowston River willrise is hard to determine due to uncertainties
with the rain falling on the snow in the high country. As a result
the forecast crest should be used as a starting point and not a
definite peak. The river will continue to rise as until rainfall
subsides and high elevation temperatures drop to around freezing
slowing snowmelt. If you live or are recreating near the river move
to higher ground, and expect higher water levels than have
previously been experienced. The flood waters will continue to move
downstream impacting Livingston today. Additional updates to the
river forecast and warning will be made as more information becomes
available.
For the Yellowstone River...including Corwin Springs, Livingston...
Unprecented flooding is forecast.
