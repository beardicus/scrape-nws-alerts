<headline>Flood Warning issued June 13 at 3:45AM MDT until June 14 at 12:05PM MDT by NWS Billings</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in
Montana...
Yellowstone River at Corwin Springs affecting Park County.
.Heavy rain falling on the snowpack over the southern
Beartooth/Absaroka mountains has resulted in unprecedented rises on
the Yellowstone River at Corwin Springs. The river is currently
higher than it has been since 1918 and continues to rise. How far
above flood stage the Yellowston River will rise is hard to
determine due to uncertainties with the rain falling on the snow in
the high country. As a result the forecast crest should be used as a
starting point and not a definite peak. If you live or are
recreating near the river move to higher ground, and expect higher
water levels than have previously been experienced. The flood waters
will continue to move downstream impacting Livingston today.
Additional updates to the river forecast and warning will be updated
as more information becomes available.
