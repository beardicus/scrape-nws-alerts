<headline>Flood Warning issued June 13 at 10:19AM MDT until June 15 at 12:00PM MDT by NWS Billings</headline>
<description>...Unprecedented flooding occurring on the following rivers in
Montana...
Yellowstone River near Livingston affecting Sweet Grass and Park
Counties.
.Heavy rain falling on the snowpack over the southern
Beartooth/Absaroka mountains has resulted in unprecedented
rises on the Yellowstone River at Corwin Springs and Livingston. The
river is currently higher than has ever been recorded
at Corwin Springs and continues to rise. This flood water will push
into Livingston later today where the record stage of 10.7 recorded
in 1997 has already been exceeded. How far above flood stage
the Yellowstone River will rise is hard to determine due to
uncertainties with the rain falling on the snow in the high country.
As a result the forecast crest should be used as a starting point
and not a definite peak. The river will continue to rise
until rainfall subsides and high elevation temperatures drop to
around freezing, slowing snowmelt. If you live or are
recreating near the river move to higher ground, and expect higher
water levels than have previously been experienced.
Additional updates to the river forecast and warning will be made as
more information becomes available.
For the Yellowstone River...including Corwin Springs and
Livingston...Unprecedented flooding is forecast.
