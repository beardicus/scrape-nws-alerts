<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM PDT THIS
MORNING THROUGH LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Dangerous rip currents and breaking waves due to
elevated surf of 3 to 6 feet expected. Minor tidal overflow
around the time of high tide.
* WHERE...Ventura County Beaches.
* WHEN...From 9 AM PDT this morning through late Wednesday night.
* IMPACTS...Pooling of sea water is possible around high tide at
beach and harbor areas that is uncommon with normal tidal
ranges. Enhanced beach erosion is also possible. No significant
damage is expected. There is an increased risk of ocean
drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea.
Waves can wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small
boats nearshore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The highest tide of 7.2 to 7.4 feet will
occur each evening from Monday through Wednesday evening
between 855 pm and 1045 pm PDT.</description>
<instruction>Remain out of the water due to hazardous swimming conditions, or
stay near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly
in such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
