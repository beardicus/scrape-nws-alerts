<headline>Flood Warning issued June 13 at 12:38PM MDT until June 16 at 4:48AM MDT by NWS Billings</headline>
<description>.Rock Creek is flooding in the Red Lodge vicinity with reports of
flooding downstream. Rainfall has decreased with temperatures over
the highest elevations cooling towards freezing, reducing the
snowmelt. Expect water levels on Rock Creek near Red Lodge to crest
over the next few hours, with levels continuing to rise today
downstream to the confluence with the Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone
River. Low bridges and roads are being over topped near Red Lodge,
and the same can be expected along the rest of Rock Creek today
through tomorrow. With the Clarks Fork River flooding, expect water
near the confluence to be higher than in other locations along the
river.

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles. Do not drive on or attempt to cross
flooded roads, find an alternate route. Roads and driveways may be
damaged or washed out in places.
Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency officials and
request they pass the information to the National Weather Service in
Billings.</instruction>
