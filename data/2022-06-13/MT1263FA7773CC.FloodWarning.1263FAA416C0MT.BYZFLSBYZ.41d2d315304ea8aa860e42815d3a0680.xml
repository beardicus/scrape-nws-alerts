<headline>Flood Warning issued June 13 at 1:47PM MDT until June 16 at 6:00AM MDT by NWS Billings</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM MDT TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Small stream flooding caused by rain and snowmelt continues.
* WHERE...A portion of south central Montana, including the
following counties, Park, Stillwater and Sweet Grass.
* WHEN...Until 600 PM MDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring. Streams
continue to rise or run out of their banks due to excess runoff
from earlier rainfall and rapid snowmelt.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 133 PM MDT, Rainfall over the past 24 hours and rapid
snowmelt in the higher elevations has small creeks and
streams running high or out of their banks. Decreasing
rainfall and temperatures cooling towards freezing over the
higher terrain will help to decrease runoff, but high water
will continue to impact the area through Tuesday.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Chico Hot Springs, Nye, Mystic Lake, Dean, Pine Creek and
Chico.

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles. Do not drive on or attempt to cross
flooded roads, find an alternate route. Roads and driveways may be
damaged or washed out in places.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency officials and
request they pass the information to the National Weather Service in
Billings.</instruction>
