<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT...
The following message is transmitted at the request of the New Mexico
Departments of Health and Environment, the United States Forest
Service and the Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality Response
Program.
* WHAT...By this evening, winds will generally be out of the west
southwest, sustained around 10 mph with occasional gusts up to 20
mph. As a result, smoke from the Pipeline Fire in Arizona will
continue to move over northwestern New Mexico. Smoke from the fires
in western areas of New Mexico will also tend to drift toward the
east through the remainder of the afternoon and evening. Light and
more variable wind conditions expected in the vicinity of the Black
Fire will cause the smoke to drift toward Caballo and Truth of
Consequences. Impacts from the Midnight Fire and Hermits Peak-Calf
Canyon Fires in northern New Mexico will be localized and may impact
areas around Angel Fire, Taos, Cimarron and the Scout Ranch.
* WHERE...Smoke impacts will be widespread around Farmington and in
most parts of San Juan County. Moderate smoke impacts will be
localized across portions of Taos, Mora and eastern Sierra counties.
Elsewhere, brief moderate impacts are expected at times between the
Rio Grande valley and the Continental Divide, but widespread
unhealthy conditions are not expected. More details and the latest
air quality information can be found at https://fire.airnow.gov
* WHEN...Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1 pm MDT
Tuesday, June 14th.
* IMPACTS...Those with conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and heart
disease will be especially vulnerable to impacts from poor air
quality, as will adults over age 65, young children, and pregnant
women if smoke concentrations become unhealthy.
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method available
at https://nmtracking.doh.nm.gov/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
https://nmtracking.doh.nm.gov/environment/air/IndoorQuality.html and
https://cv.nmhealth.org
New Mexicans will also need to take steps to keep their homes cool to
avoid heat-related illnesses. NMDOH offers tips here:
