<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM MDT TUESDAY...
The New Mexico Departments of Health and Environment has issued an
Air Quality Alert, until 1 PM MDT Tuesday.
* WHAT... Winds will be out of the west-southwest sustained around
10 mph and gusts up to 20 mph. Smoke from the Pipeline Fire in
Arizona will likely move in over the northwest part of the state.
Smoke from the fires in western areas of the state will tend to
drift toward the east through the remainder of the afternoon and
evening. Light and more variable wind conditions expected in the
vicinity of the Black fire causing the smoke to drift to the areas
around Caballo and Truth or Consequences. Impacts from Midnight
Fire and Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire will be localized and may
impact areas around Angel Fire, Taos, Cimarron and Scout Ranch.
* WHERE... Smoke impacts will be widespread around Farmington and in
most parts of San Juan County. Moderate smoke impacts will be
localized across portions of Taos, Mora, and eastern Sierra
counties. Elsewhere, brief moderate impacts are expected at times
between the Rio Grande Valley and Continental Divide but widespread
unhealthy conditions are not expected. More details and latest air
quality information can be found at https://fire.airnow.gov
* WHEN... Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1pm MDT
Tuesday, June 14th.
* IMPACTS...Those with conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and heart
disease will be especially vulnerable to impacts from poor air
quality, as will adults over age 65, young children, and pregnant
women if smoke concentrations become unhealthy.
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method available
at https://nmtracking.doh.nm.gov/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
https://nmtracking.doh.nm.gov/environment/air/IndoorQuality.html and
https://cv.nmhealth.org
New Mexicans will also need to take steps to keep their homes cool to
avoid heat-related illnesses. NMDOH offers tips here:
