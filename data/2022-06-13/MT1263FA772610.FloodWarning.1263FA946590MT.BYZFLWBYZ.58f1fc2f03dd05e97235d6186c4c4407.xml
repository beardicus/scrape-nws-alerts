<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles. Do not drive on or attempt to cross
flooded roads, find an alternate route. Roads and driveways may be
damaged or washed out in places.
Caution is urged when walking near riverbanks. Undercut banks can
collapse and you will find yourself in a deadly situation in fast
moving cold water. Stay away from river banks until the river
recedes to normal summer flows, especially children.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency officials and
request they pass the information to the National Weather Service in
Billings.

expected to impact people and property in the warned area. Prepare
for flooding impacts associated with the forecast river levels in
