<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 1045 PM PDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Urban and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Los Angeles County coasts, valleys and lower mountains.
* WHEN...Until 1045 PM PDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Heavy rainfall could trigger shallow debris flows,
especially in and near recent wildfire burn scars. Minor flooding
is in low-lying and poor drainage areas with water ponding on area
roadways.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 437 PM PDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated heavy rain. This will cause urban and small stream
flooding. Between 0.5 and 2 inches of rain have fallen.
- Peak rainfall rates of 0.25 to 0.5 inches per hour and
locally higher are expected. Additional rainfall amounts of 1
to 3 inches are expected over the area. This additional rain
will result in minor flooding. Rainfall intensity is expected
to increase in the 5 to 7 pm timeframe and flash flooding
cannot be ruled out during this time.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Long Beach, Malibu, Burbank, Downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood,
Beverly Hills, Culver City, Van Nuys, Inglewood, Pasadena,
Alhambra, Encino, and Santa Monica.

<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas. The rain will likely trigger
shallow mud and debris flows, minor rock falls, and flooding capable
of localized damage, especially in steep terrain in and near burn
scars.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.</instruction>
