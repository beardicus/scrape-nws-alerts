<headline>Flood Watch issued March 21 at 9:06PM MST until March 22 at 8:00PM MST by NWS Flagstaff</headline>
<description>.Heavy rain continues to fall across the region with some of the
rain falling on snow. This is leading to increased flows in
waterways. Several creeks and waterways have reached critical
levels. Additional rises in river, creek, and stream levels are
expected. Be aware that Flood Warnings and Advisories are in effect
for portions of central and northern Arizona.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH WEDNESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt continues to be
possible with some areas currently experiencing flooding in
Yavapai County and northern Gila County.
* WHERE...Portions of central and northern Arizona, including
northern Gila County and Yavapai County.
* WHEN...Through Wednesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Flash flooding will be possible in creeks, normally dry
washes, swimming holes and over recently burned areas. Low-water
crossings could also experience flash flooding, which would create
deadly travel conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Ample moisture and widespread, continuous rain and snow along
the Mogollon Rim and southward have led to increased runoff.
Waterways continue to experience elevated flows. Rain on snow
has also contributed to elevated flows and the risk of
flooding. These conditions will remain through Wednesday
afternoon with flooding possible through Wednesday evening.
- Visit www.weather.gov/safety/flood for more information on
flood safety.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings and Advisories. Those living in areas prone to flooding
should be prepared to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
