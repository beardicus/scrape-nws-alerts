<headline>Flood Watch issued March 21 at 2:34PM MST until March 22 at 1:00PM MST by NWS Flagstaff</headline>
<description>.Heavy rain continues to fall on a deep primed snowpack, leading to
increased flows in waterways especially for lower elevation creeks
and rivers. Flows in many rivers, creeks, and streams have increase
quickly through today with some reaching critical levels. Additional
rises in river, creek, and stream levels are expected.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH WEDNESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt continues to be
possible with some areas already experiencing flooding in Yavapai
County and northern Gila County.
* WHERE...Portions of central and northern Arizona including
northern Gila County and Yavapai County.
* WHEN...Through Wednesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Flooding will be possible in creeks, normally dry
washes, swimming holes and over recently burned areas. Low-water
crossings could also experience flooding, which would create
deadly travel conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Ample moisture and widespread, continuous rain and snow along
the Mogollon Rim and southward have led to increased runoff.
Waterways were already experiencing elevated flows. Rain on
snow has also contributed to elevated flows and the risk of
flooding.

flood safety.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
