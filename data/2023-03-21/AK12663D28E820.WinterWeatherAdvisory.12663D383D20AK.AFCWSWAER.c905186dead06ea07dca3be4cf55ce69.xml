<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued March 21 at 9:52PM AKDT until March 22 at 10:00PM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM TO 10 PM AKDT
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Snow and blowing snow expected. Total snow accumulations
of up to 6 inches with locally higher amounts across interior
locations of Kodiak Island. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 3
inches for Kodiak City. Winds gusting as high as 55 mph.
* WHERE...Communities along the western and southern portions of
Kodiak Island, including Larsen Bay, Karluk, Akhiok, and Old
Harbor.
* WHEN...From 4 AM to 10 PM AKDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. Strong winds could
cause tree damage.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A strong storm system will move from west
of Akhiok Tuesday night to east of Kodiak City by early
Wednesday afternoon. As it does, a mix of rain and snow will
changeover to snow for western and southern Kodiak Island. Gusty
northwesterly winds will also develop across the southern half
of the island by early Wednesday morning. Several inches of snow
is expected for communities across the western and southern
portions of the island. The combination of snow and wind could
reduce visibility to as low as one half mile at times before
snow tapers off Wednesday evening. A mix of rain and snow is
also expected to change to snow along northern and eastern
portions of the island Wednesday as winds shift from the east to
the northwest. However, warmer temperatures along the eastern
half of the island will likely limit blowing snow potential.
Prolonged easterly winds along the eastern coast will also keep
the potential for rain to mix in with snow at times, limiting
total snow accumulations.</description>
