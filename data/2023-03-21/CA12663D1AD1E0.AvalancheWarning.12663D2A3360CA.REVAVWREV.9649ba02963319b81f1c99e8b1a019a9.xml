<headline>Avalanche Warning issued March 21 at 6:20AM PDT  by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>The following message is transmitted at the request of the
Eastern Sierra Avalanche Center.
The Eastern Sierra Avalanche Center in Mammoth Lakes has issued a
BACKCOUNTRY AVALANCHE WARNING for the following areas: NWS Las Vegas
NV - CA-519 (Eastern Sierra in Inyo County) NWS Reno NV - CA-073
(Eastern Sierra in Mono County)
* WHAT...The avalanche danger for the warning area will rise to HIGH
at all elevations today. Very dangerous avalanche conditions are
expected to continue through at least 7 am on Wednesday, March
22nd.
* WHERE...The eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range
between Virginia Lakes to the north to Bishop Creek to the south
* WHEN...In effect from Tue 07:00 PDT to Wed 07:00 PDT.
* IMPACTS...Heavy snowfall and strong winds will overload the
snowpack, creating widespread areas of unstable snow. Expect the
size and distribution of storm slabs and wind deposits to grow as
the storm ramps up. In isolated areas, sliding snow could step
down to deeper weak layers resulting in very large avalanches. It
will be difficult to maintain adequate safety margins today.
Traveling in and below avalanche terrain is not recommended.
* PRECAUTIONARY / PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...Very dangerous avalanche
conditions exist. Travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended.
Avalanches may run long distances and can run into mature forests,
valley floors, or flat terrain.
Consult http://www.esavalanche.org/ or www.avalanche.org for more
detailed information.
Similar avalanche danger may exist at locations outside the coverage
area of this or any avalanche center.</description>
