<headline>Avalanche Warning issued March 21 at 6:18AM PDT  by NWS LasVegas</headline>
<description>The Eastern Sierra Avalanche Center in Mammoth Lakes
has issued a Backcountry Avalanche Warning for the
following areas: the Eastern Sierra in Mono County and
the Eastern Sierra in Inyo County
* WHAT...The avalanche danger for the warning area will rise to
HIGH at all elevations today. Very dangerous avalanche
conditions are expected to continue through at least 7 AM on
Wednesday, March 22nd.
* WHERE...The eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range
between Virginia Lakes to the north to Bishop Creek to the
south.
* WHEN...From 7 AM Tuesday to 7 AM Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Heavy snowfall and strong winds will overload the
snowpack, creating widespread areas of unstable snow. Expect the
size and distribution of storm slabs and wind deposits to grow
as the storm ramps up. In isolated areas, sliding snow could
step down to deeper week layers resulting in very large
avalanches. It will be difficult to maintain adequate safety
margins today. Traveling in and below avalanche terrain is not
recommended.
* PRECAUTIONARY / PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...Very dangerous
avalanche conditions exist. Travel in avalanche terrain
is not recommended. Avalanches may run long
distances and can run into mature forests, valley
floors, or flat terrain.
Consult http://www.esavalanche.org or
www.avalanche.org for more detailed information
Similar avalanche danger may exist at locations outside the
coverage area of this or any avalanche center.</description>
