air-conditioned room, stay out of the sun, and check up on
relatives and neighbors. Young children and pets should never be
left unattended in vehicles under any circumstances. Take extra

fitting clothing. Try to limit strenuous activities to early morning
or evening. Take action when you see symptoms of heat exhaustion and
heat stroke.

To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational Safety and
