...AIR QUALITY ALERT NOW IN EFFECT FROM NOON CDT SUNDAY TO 6 PM CDT
MONDAY...

* WHAT...The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has issued an Air
Quality Alert for fine particles pollution. The Air Quality Index
(AQI) is expected to reach the Red or Unhealthy category.

* WHERE...Northeastern Minnesota including Cook, Lake, St. Louis, and
Carlton Counties.

* WHEN...From Noon CDT Sunday until 6 PM CDT Monday.

* IMPACTS...Some members of the general public may experience health
effects. Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease
(including asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults, may
experience health effects.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Smoke that was lingering over northeastern
Minnesota has cleared. The air quality in the Arrowhead will remain
in the Yellow (Moderate) category, which is below air quality alert
criteria on Saturday. However more smoke is expected Sunday afternoon
and will linger into Monday. People should consider moving outdoor
activities to Saturday and plan on limiting outdoor exertion Sunday
and Monday. Additional smoke events are possible into next week, and
this alert may need to be extended.

        <instruction>Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including
asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults, should avoid
prolonged or heavy exertion. The general public should limit
prolonged or heavy exertion.

Reduce or eliminate activities that contribute to air pollution, such
as outdoor burning, and use of residential wood burning devices.
Reduce vehicle trips and vehicle idling as much as possible.
Keep windows closed overnight to prevent smoke from getting indoors.</instruction>
