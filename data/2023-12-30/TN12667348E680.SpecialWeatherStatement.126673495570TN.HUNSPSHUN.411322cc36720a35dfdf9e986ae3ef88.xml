<description>...Patchy Drizzle and Freezing Drizzle possible for portions of far
northeast Alabama and adjacent middle Tennessee...
Patchy drizzle and some freezing drizzle is possible, mainly in the
higher elevations of Franklin, Jackson, and DeKalb counties this
morning. Visibilities locally could be reduced to one quarter of a
mile in spots. Air temperatures were hovering in the lower 30s,
therefore some of the drizzle could freeze on elevated surfaces.
Temperatures warming above freezing should help alleviate the threat
after 9 AM this morning.
Motorists are urged to drive with extreme caution, as visibilities
will vary significantly given the patchy nature of the fog. Use low
beams, reduce driving speed, and allow for plenty of room between you
and other vehicles.
Stay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio, or a favorite local media outlet,
for further statements or updates from the National Weather Service
in Huntsville.</description>
