<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued March 14 at 9:12PM PDT until March 15 at 7:00PM PDT by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>...Very long to long period west-northwest swell, sneaker waves
and strong rip currents from coastal Sonoma County to coastal
Monterey County tonight through 7 PM PDT Tuesday...
.Very long to long period west-northwest swell developing from
coastal Sonoma County to coastal Monterey County this evening and
tonight resulting in a high risk of sneaker waves and strong rip
currents. Swell periods gradually decreasing Tuesday morning and
afternoon, however the risk of both strong rip currents and
sneaker waves will continue during the day. Swell heights and
periods look to ease off Tuesday night and early Wednesday.
On days with high sneaker wave risk, the ocean can appear
deceptively calm with long lulls between larger wave sets. This
may lead to individuals venturing onto exposed coastal features
where infrequent but powerful waves can overwhelm them, knocking
them into the cold, restless ocean where the possibility of
hypothermia or drowning is severe. Each year, individuals lose
their life during similar sneaker wave events along the
California coast. If visiting the coast this weekend, respect the
power of the ocean, remain vigilant of your surroundings, and
avoiding venturing onto exposed coastal features where sudden,
powerful waves can put your life at risk.
