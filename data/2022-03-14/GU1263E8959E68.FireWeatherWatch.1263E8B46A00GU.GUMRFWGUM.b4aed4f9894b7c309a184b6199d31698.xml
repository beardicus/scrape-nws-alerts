<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued March 14 at 4:18AM ChST until March 16 at 6:00AM ChST by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...STRONG DAYTIME WINDS AND DRY CONDITIONS MAY LEAD TO RAPID FIRE
SPREAD ACROSS PARTS OF GUAM...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE TUESDAY NIGHT...
The National Weather Service in Tiyan has issued a Fire Weather
Watch, which is in effect through late Tuesday night.
* WIND...Sustained 15 to 25 mph with gusts to 30 mph during the
afternoons through Tuesday.
* HUMIDITY...As low as 55 to 60 percent in the afternoons.
* HIGHEST THREAT...Southern part of Guam, mainly along and south of
Cross Island Road.
* IMPACTS...any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly.
Outdoor burning is not recommended.
* ADDITIONAL INFORMATION...Very little rainfall is expected for the
next several days, allowing for sustained drier conditions. Fuel
stick readings around 10, max sustained winds just near 20 mph and
low humidity values give strong support for consideration of Red
Flag Warning later today. Scattered showers are expected
Wednesday, but model guidance indicates a drying trend, so the fire
weather watch may be extended.</description>
<instruction>A fire weather watch means that critical fire weather conditions are
forecast to occur. Listen for later forecasts and possible red flag
warnings.</instruction>
