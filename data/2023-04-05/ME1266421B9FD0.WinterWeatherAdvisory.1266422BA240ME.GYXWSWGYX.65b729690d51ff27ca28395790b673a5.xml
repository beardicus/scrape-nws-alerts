<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued April 05 at 3:08AM EDT until April 06 at 8:00AM EDT by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...SLEET AND FREEZING RAIN EXPECTED TODAY INTO EARLY THURSDAY
MORNING...
.Cooler air filtering in from high pressure building into Maritime
Canada will allow a spring storm to bring a mix of wintry
precipitation, mainly in the form of freezing rain and sleet in the
advisory area. While precipitation is ongoing mainly across the
mountains this morning, more widespread precipitation is expected to
develop this afternoon and evening. Cooling temperatures this
evening will see cold rain in the foothills and interior locations
turn to freezing rain. Slick travel conditions are the primary
hazard with this storm, especially after sunset, lasting through
Thursday morning. Temperatures are expected to rebound above
freezing through Thursday morning, bringing an end to freezing
precipitation.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM THIS MORNING
TO 8 AM EDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow accumulations up
to 2 inches, sleet accumulations around 1 inch and ice
accumulations between one tenth and four tenths of an inch.
* WHERE...Portions of south central, west central, and western
Maine. Portions of northern New Hampshire.
* WHEN...From 11 AM this morning to 8 AM EDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Difficult travel conditions are possible due to icy road
conditions. A period of mixed precipitation is expected with air
temperatures remaining below freezing. Isolated power outages
possible due to ice-weighted branches, especially at higher
elevation with potential for wind gusts to near 30 mph. The
hazardous conditions could impact the Wednesday evening and
Thursday morning commutes.</description>
