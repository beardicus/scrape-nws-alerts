<headline>Flood Warning issued April 05 at 11:54AM EDT until April 10 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Grand Rapids</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in
Michigan...
Red Cedar River At East Lansing affecting Ingham County.
Maple River at Maple Rapids affecting Clinton County.
Thornapple River Above Hastings affecting Barry County.
.Another round of heavy rain has fallen across Lower Michigan.
Rainfall totals in the last 24 hours are around 1.5 inches across
the Muskegon and Grand River basins. This will worsen and prolong
the high water conditions that many areas are already experiencing,
and bring additional locations above flood stage over the next few
days. Generally dry weather will prevail through the weekend, so
once this water works through the rivers the water levels should
finally start to drop.

* WHAT...Minor flooding is occurring and minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Thornapple River Above Hastings.
* WHEN...Until Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...At 8.0 feet, Expect minor flooding of River Road and
homes at Quimby along River Lane, Charlton Park, and Berry`s
Landing.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 10:15 AM EDT Wednesday the stage was 7.5 feet.
- Recent Activity...The maximum river stage in the 24 hours
ending at 10:15 AM EDT Wednesday was 7.5 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise to a crest of 8.3
feet early Friday morning. It will then fall below flood
stage Monday morning.
- Flood stage is 7.0 feet.
