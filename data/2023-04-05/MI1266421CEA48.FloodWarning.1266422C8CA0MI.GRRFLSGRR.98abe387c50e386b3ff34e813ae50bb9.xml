<senderName>NWS Grand Rapids (Southwestern Michigan)</senderName>
<headline>Flood Warning issued April 05 at 11:54AM EDT until further notice by NWS Grand Rapids</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in
Michigan...
Red Cedar River At East Lansing affecting Ingham County.
Maple River at Maple Rapids affecting Clinton County.
Thornapple River Above Hastings affecting Barry County.
.Another round of heavy rain has fallen across Lower Michigan.
Rainfall totals in the last 24 hours are around 1.5 inches across
the Muskegon and Grand River basins. This will worsen and prolong
the high water conditions that many areas are already experiencing,
and bring additional locations above flood stage over the next few
days. Generally dry weather will prevail through the weekend, so
once this water works through the rivers the water levels should
finally start to drop.
