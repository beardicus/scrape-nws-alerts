<headline>Flood Warning issued April 05 at 11:54AM EDT until April 09 at 11:00AM EDT by NWS Grand Rapids</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Grand Rapids MI has issued a

Muskegon River at Newaygo affecting Newaygo County.
...Forecast flooding changed from Minor to Moderate severity and
increased in duration for the following rivers in Michigan...
Grand River near Comstock Park affecting Kent County.
.Another round of heavy rain has fallen across Lower Michigan.
Rainfall totals in the last 24 hours are around 1.5 inches across
the Muskegon and Grand River basins. This will worsen and prolong
the high water conditions that many areas are already experiencing,
and bring additional locations above flood stage over the next few
days. Generally dry weather will prevail through the weekend, so
once this water works through the rivers the water levels should
finally start to drop.
