<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM EDT THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of southeast Michigan, including the following
counties, Bay and Midland.
* WHEN...Until 10 AM EDT this morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Area creeks and
streams are running high and could flood with more heavy rain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Moderate to heavy rainfall through the morning will be
capable of producing an additional half inch to three
quarters of an inch. This combined with wet soils from recent
rainfalls over the last few days may lead to flooding across
parts of the area.
