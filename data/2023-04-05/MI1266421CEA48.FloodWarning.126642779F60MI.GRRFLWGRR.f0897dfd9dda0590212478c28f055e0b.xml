<headline>Flood Warning issued April 05 at 11:54AM EDT until April 11 at 6:00AM EDT by NWS Grand Rapids</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Grand Rapids MI has issued a
Flood Warning for the following rivers in Michigan...
Grand River at Robinson Township affecting Ottawa County.
Sycamore Creek At Holt affecting Ingham County.
Thornapple River Near Caledonia affecting Kent County.
Muskegon River at Bridgeton affecting Newaygo County.
Muskegon River at Newaygo affecting Newaygo County.
...Forecast flooding changed from Minor to Moderate severity and
increased in duration for the following rivers in Michigan...
Grand River near Comstock Park affecting Kent County.
.Another round of heavy rain has fallen across Lower Michigan.
Rainfall totals in the last 24 hours are around 1.5 inches across
the Muskegon and Grand River basins. This will worsen and prolong
the high water conditions that many areas are already experiencing,
and bring additional locations above flood stage over the next few
days. Generally dry weather will prevail through the weekend, so
once this water works through the rivers the water levels should
finally start to drop.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM THIS EVENING TO TUESDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Muskegon River at Newaygo.
* WHEN...From this evening to Tuesday morning.
* IMPACTS...At 12.0 feet, Flood water begins surrounding cottages
and homes downstream from the City of Newaygo in the area of
Sycamore Flats in Ashland Township.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 9:45 AM EDT Wednesday the stage was 10.9 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above flood stage
this evening to a crest of 11.6 feet Thursday night. It will
then fall below flood stage early Tuesday morning.
- Flood stage is 11.0 feet.
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
11.5 feet on 04/30/2020.
