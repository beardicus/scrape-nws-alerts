<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued April 05 at 10:12PM EDT until April 06 at 8:00AM EDT by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...SLEET AND FREEZING RAIN EXPECTED TODAY INTO EARLY THURSDAY
MORNING...
.Cooler air filtering in from high pressure building into Maritime
Canada will allow a spring storm to bring a mix of wintry
precipitation, mainly in the form of freezing rain and sleet in the
advisory area. While precipitation is ongoing mainly across the
mountains this morning, more widespread precipitation is expected to
develop this afternoon and evening. Cooling temperatures this
evening will see cold rain in the foothills and interior locations
turn to freezing rain. Slick travel conditions are the primary
hazard with this storm, especially after sunset, lasting through
Thursday morning. Temperatures are expected to rebound above
freezing through Thursday morning, bringing an end to freezing
precipitation.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM EDT
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation. Additional snow accumulations up to
one inch, sleet accumulations between one tenth and two tenths of
an inch and ice accumulations around two tenths of an inch.
* WHERE...Portions of south central, west central, and western
Maine. Portions of northern New Hampshire.
* WHEN...Until 8 AM EDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Difficult travel conditions are possible due to icy road
conditions. Even light snowfall amounts can accumulate on roads
and cause dangerous driving conditions due to snow covered roads.
The hazardous conditions could impact the Thursday morning commute.</description>
