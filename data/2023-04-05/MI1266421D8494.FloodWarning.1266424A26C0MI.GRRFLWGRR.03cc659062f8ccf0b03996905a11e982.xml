<headline>Flood Warning issued April 05 at 3:49PM EDT until April 08 at 8:00AM EDT by NWS Grand Rapids</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Grand Rapids MI has issued a
Flood Warning for the following rivers in Michigan...
Grand River at Lansing affecting Ingham County.
Grand River at Ionia affecting Ionia County.
Grand River at Lowell affecting Kent County.
Grand River at Ada affecting Kent County.
Grand River at Grand Rapids affecting Kent County.
Looking Glass River Near Eagle affecting Clinton County.
.Another round of heavy rain has fallen across Lower Michigan.
Rainfall totals in the last 24 hours are around 1.5 inches across
much of the Grand River basin. This will worsen and prolong
the high water conditions that many areas are already experiencing,
and bring additional locations above flood stage over the next few
days. Generally dry weather will prevail through the weekend, so
once this water works through the rivers the water levels should
finally start to drop.
