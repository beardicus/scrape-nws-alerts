<headline>Flood Warning issued April 05 at 3:49PM EDT until April 10 at 6:30PM EDT by NWS Grand Rapids</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Grand Rapids MI has issued a
Flood Warning for the following rivers in Michigan...
Grand River at Lansing affecting Ingham County.
Grand River at Ionia affecting Ionia County.
Grand River at Lowell affecting Kent County.
Grand River at Ada affecting Kent County.
Grand River at Grand Rapids affecting Kent County.
Looking Glass River Near Eagle affecting Clinton County.
.Another round of heavy rain has fallen across Lower Michigan.
Rainfall totals in the last 24 hours are around 1.5 inches across
much of the Grand River basin. This will worsen and prolong
the high water conditions that many areas are already experiencing,
and bring additional locations above flood stage over the next few
days. Generally dry weather will prevail through the weekend, so
once this water works through the rivers the water levels should
finally start to drop.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY EVENING TO MONDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Grand River at Ada.
* WHEN...From Thursday evening to Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...At 21.6 feet, 500 parking spaces in the Alticor Inc.
parking lot are inundated and one gate into the Alticor Inc.
complex is closed due to the high water. Ada River Walk near
Covered Bridge and Leonard Field Ball Park in Ada flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 2:00 PM EDT Wednesday the stage was 17.5 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above flood stage
tomorrow evening to a crest of 21.5 feet early Saturday
afternoon. It will then fall below flood stage Monday
morning.
- Flood stage is 20.0 feet.
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
21.6 feet on 05/21/2020.
