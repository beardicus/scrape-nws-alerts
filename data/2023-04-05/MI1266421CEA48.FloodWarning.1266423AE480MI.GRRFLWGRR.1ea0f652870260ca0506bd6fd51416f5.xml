<headline>Flood Warning issued April 05 at 11:54AM EDT until April 07 at 8:00AM EDT by NWS Grand Rapids</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Grand Rapids MI has issued a
Flood Warning for the following rivers in Michigan...
Grand River at Robinson Township affecting Ottawa County.
Sycamore Creek At Holt affecting Ingham County.
Thornapple River Near Caledonia affecting Kent County.
Muskegon River at Bridgeton affecting Newaygo County.
Muskegon River at Newaygo affecting Newaygo County.
...Forecast flooding changed from Minor to Moderate severity and
increased in duration for the following rivers in Michigan...
Grand River near Comstock Park affecting Kent County.
.Another round of heavy rain has fallen across Lower Michigan.
Rainfall totals in the last 24 hours are around 1.5 inches across
the Muskegon and Grand River basins. This will worsen and prolong
the high water conditions that many areas are already experiencing,
and bring additional locations above flood stage over the next few
days. Generally dry weather will prevail through the weekend, so
once this water works through the rivers the water levels should
finally start to drop.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM THIS MORNING TO FRIDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Sycamore Creek At Holt.
* WHEN...From this morning to Friday morning.
* IMPACTS...At 8.0 feet, Expect minor flooding of low lying areas
adjacent to the river, in the Lansing Municipal Golf Course and
sections of East Mt. Hope Road.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 10:00 AM EDT Wednesday the stage was 8.0 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above flood stage
this afternoon to a crest of 8.1 feet this evening. It will
then fall below flood stage tomorrow morning.
- Flood stage is 8.0 feet.
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
8.2 feet on 04/24/2022.
