<description>...EXPECT A PROLONGED PERIOD OF HIGH WATER AND FLOODING WITHIN
THE RAINY LAKE BASIN...
Spring snowmelt plus well above normal April precipitation has
created a strong hydrologic response within the Rainy Lake basin.
Many tributaries to Rainy Lake and the Rainy River are at their
crest after weekend rains. Lake rises within the Rainy Lake Basin
are ongoing and are expected to continue for at least the next week
to ten days. Snowpack still exists in the basin, and with warmer
temperatures and rainfall in the forecast expect increasing water
levels.
At 3:30 PM, Sunday, May 8th the Namakan Lake level was 1119.5
feet. In 2014 the highest lake level was 1120 feet. A record level
was set on Lake Namakan in 1950 when it reached 1122.70 feet.
Maximum releases from dams on Namakan Lake and Rainy Lake are
planned in an effort to slow surging lake rises.  This will cause an
increase in the  level on the Rainy River. Expect high water levels
within the Rainy Lake system for the next several weeks.
