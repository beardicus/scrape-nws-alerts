<headline>Hard Freeze Warning issued May 08 at 8:57PM MDT until May 09 at 9:00AM MDT by NWS Saltlake</headline>
<description>...WIND ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT MDT TONIGHT...
...HARD FREEZE WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM MDT MONDAY...
...HIGH WIND WARNING WILL EXPIRE AT 9 PM MDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Hard Freeze Warning, sub-freezing temperatures
as low as 25 expected. For the Wind Advisory, west winds 20 to
25 mph with gusts to 45 mph expected.
* WHERE...Southwest Utah.
* WHEN...For the Hard Freeze Warning, until 9 AM MDT Monday. For
the Wind Advisory, until midnight MDT tonight.
* IMPACTS...Gusty winds could blow around unsecured objects. A few
power outages are possible. Strong crosswinds and blowing dust
will cause difficult travel, particularly for high profile
vehicles. Frost and freeze conditions will kill crops, other
sensitive vegetation and possibly damage unprotected outdoor
plumbing.</description>
<instruction>Use extra caution when driving, especially if operating a high
profile vehicle. Secure outdoor objects.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
