<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM MDT THIS EVENING...
...HARD FREEZE WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM THIS EVENING
TO 9 AM MDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Wind Warning, southwest winds 30 to 35 mph
with gusts up to 60 mph. For the Hard Freeze Warning, sub-
freezing temperatures as low as 25 expected.
* WHERE...Southwest Utah.
* WHEN...For the High Wind Warning, until 9 PM MDT this evening.
For the Hard Freeze Warning, from 9 PM this evening to 9 AM
MDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...High winds may move loose debris, damage property and
cause power outages. Travel will be difficult especially for
high profile vehicles. Frost and freeze conditions will kill
crops, other sensitive vegetation and possibly damage
unprotected outdoor plumbing.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Areas of blowing dust will be possible and
reduce visibility, causing hazardous driving conditions.</description>
<instruction>People are urged to secure loose objects that could be blown
around or damaged by the wind.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
