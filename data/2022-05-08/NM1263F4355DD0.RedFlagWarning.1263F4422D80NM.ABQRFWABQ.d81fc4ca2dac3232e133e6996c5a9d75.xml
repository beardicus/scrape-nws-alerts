OF SINGLE DIGIT HUMIDITY, ABOVE AVERAGE WARMTH AS WELL AS AN
UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR ALL OTHER AREAS FROM

EASTWARD INTO THE PLAINS OF NEW MEXICO DUE TO STRONG WINDS, LOW

.A dire and critical to extreme fire weather event is underway.
This long duration of strong, gusty and potentially damaging winds
will continue into Monday along with exceptionally low afternoon
humidity and poor overnight humidity recoveries. Above normal
temperatures will also persist into the middle of the week along
with high Haines indices that will yield very unstable conditions
leading to rapid and potentially catastrophic fire spread and
growth. While winds are expected to decrease in speed some Monday
evening, gusty winds will redevelop over much of the eastern half
of New Mexico on Tuesday, leading to another round of critical
fire weather conditions.
