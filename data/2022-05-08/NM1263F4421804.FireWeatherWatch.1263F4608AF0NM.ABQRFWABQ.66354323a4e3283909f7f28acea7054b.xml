<description>...LONG DURATION RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FOR THE NORTHEAST
HIGHLANDS AS WELL AS THE SANDIA, MANZANO, AND GALLINAS MOUNTAINS
THROUGH 9 PM MDT MONDAY DUE TO VERY STRONG WINDS, SEVERAL HOURS
OF SINGLE DIGIT HUMIDITY, ABOVE AVERAGE WARMTH AS WELL AS AN
UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR ALL OTHER AREAS FROM
9 AM TO 9 PM ON MONDAY DUE TO STRONG WINDS, LOW HUMIDITY, ABOVE
AVERAGE WARMTH AND AN UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FOR THE CENTRAL MOUNTAIN CHAIN
EASTWARD INTO THE PLAINS OF NEW MEXICO DUE TO STRONG WINDS, LOW
HUMIDITY, ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND AN UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
.A dire and critical to extreme fire weather event is underway.
This long duration of strong, gusty and potentially damaging
winds will continue into Monday along with exceptionally low
afternoon humidity and poor overnight humidity recoveries. Above
normal temperatures will also persist into the middle of the week
along with high Haines indices that will yield very unstable
conditions leading to rapid and potentially catastrophic fire
spread and growth. While winds are expected to decrease in speed
some Monday evening, gusty winds will redevelop over much of the
eastern half of New Mexico on Tuesday, leading to another round
of critical fire weather conditions.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM MDT MONDAY...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY MORNING
THROUGH TUESDAY EVENING...
* AREA AND TIMING...Sandia, Manzano and Gallinas Mountains
through 9PM MDT Monday. The most critical fire weather
conditions will be during the afternoon and early evening
hours. Critical conditions are expected to redevelop late
Tuesday morning through early evening.
* 20 FOOT WINDS...Southwest winds of 30 to 40 mph with
occasional gusts of 55 to 65 mph on today and Monday. South
southwest winds of 20 to 25 mph with occasional gusts to 35
mph.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...Ranging from 7 to 10 percent each day with
long durations of single digit relative humidities. Poor
overnight recoveries can also be expected.
* IMPACTS...Any fires that develop will likely spread very
rapidly and will be dangerously difficult to control. In
addition, long range spotting and extreme fire behavior is
possible. Outdoor burning should not be done.</description>
