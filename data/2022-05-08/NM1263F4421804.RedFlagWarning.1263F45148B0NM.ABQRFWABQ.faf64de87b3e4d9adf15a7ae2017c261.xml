<headline>Red Flag Warning issued May 08 at 9:45PM MDT until May 09 at 9:00PM MDT by NWS Albuquerque</headline>
<description>...LONG DURATION RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FOR THE NORTHEAST
HIGHLANDS AS WELL AS THE SANDIA, MANZANO, AND GALLINAS MOUNTAINS
THROUGH 9 PM MDT MONDAY DUE TO VERY STRONG WINDS, SEVERAL HOURS
OF SINGLE DIGIT HUMIDITY, ABOVE AVERAGE WARMTH AS WELL AS AN
UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR ALL OTHER AREAS FROM
9 AM TO 9 PM ON MONDAY DUE TO STRONG WINDS, LOW HUMIDITY, ABOVE
AVERAGE WARMTH AND AN UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FOR THE CENTRAL MOUNTAIN CHAIN
EASTWARD INTO THE PLAINS OF NEW MEXICO DUE TO STRONG WINDS, LOW
HUMIDITY, ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND AN UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
.A dire and critical to extreme fire weather event is underway.
This long duration of strong, gusty and potentially damaging
winds will continue into Monday along with exceptionally low
afternoon humidity and poor overnight humidity recoveries. Above
normal temperatures will also persist into the middle of the week
along with high Haines indices that will yield very unstable
conditions leading to rapid and potentially catastrophic fire
spread and growth. While winds are expected to decrease in speed
some Monday evening, gusty winds will redevelop over much of the
eastern half of New Mexico on Tuesday, leading to another round
of critical fire weather conditions.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM MDT MONDAY...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY MORNING
THROUGH TUESDAY EVENING...
* AREA AND TIMING...Northeast Highlands through 9 PM MDT Monday.
The most critical fire weather conditions will be during the
afternoon and early evening hours. Critical conditions are
expected to redevelop late Tuesday morning through early
evening.
* 20 FOOT WINDS...Southwest winds 30 to 40 mph with potential
gusts of 55 to 75 mph through Monday evening. The highest
gusts will be observed along the east slopes of the Sangre de
Cristo mountains. South southwest winds of 20 to 30 mph with
occasional gusts to 40 mph.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...Ranging from 6 to 15 percent each day with
long duration single digit humidity. In addition, poor
overnight recoveries can be expected.
* IMPACTS...Any fires that develop will spread very rapidly and
will be incredibly difficult to control. In addition, long
range spotting and extreme fire behavior is likely. Outdoor
burning should not be done.</description>
