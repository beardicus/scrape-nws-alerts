<headline>Red Flag Warning issued May 08 at 3:18PM CDT until May 08 at 11:00PM CDT by NWS El Paso</headline>
<description>...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS FOR SUNDAY...
.Stronger southwest flow on Sunday will combine with a surface
low developing along the Front Range of the Rockies. These two
conditions will lead to very windy conditions for southern New
Mexico and far west Texas. The strong winds, extremely low
humidity, and very dry fuel conditions will lead to critical fire
weather conditions Sunday afternoon. Min RH will dip into the
single digits during the afternoon and evening hours, followed by
poor overnight recoveries. Critical conditions are expected to
persist through Monday as the surface low slowly moves east
during the afternoon hours, keeping a tight pressure gradient. At
least winds will be lighter on Monday.

EVENING FOR STRONG WINDS AND VERY LOW HUMIDITY FOR FIRE WEATHER
ZONES 055, 056, 110, 111, 112, AND 113...
