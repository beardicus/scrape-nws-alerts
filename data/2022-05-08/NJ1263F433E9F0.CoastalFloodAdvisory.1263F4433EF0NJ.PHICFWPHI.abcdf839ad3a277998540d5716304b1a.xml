<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued May 08 at 6:52AM EDT until May 09 at 7:00AM EDT by NWS Philadelphia - Mount Holly</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 AM EDT
MONDAY...
* WHAT...Up to one foot of inundation above ground level in low-
lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...Ocean and Southeastern Burlington Counties.
* WHEN...Until 7 AM EDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...At this level, flooding begins on the most
vulnerable roads in coastal and bayside communities, and along
inland tidal waterways. Some partial or full road closures are
possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Highest tide levels will occur around the
times of high tides this afternoon and overnight tonight.
However, tidal flooding may linger on back bays even between
high tide cycles. Flooding impacts will likely be higher on
back bays than the ocean front. Minor tidal flooding may
linger with the Tuesday morning high tide.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>A Coastal Flood Advisory means that minor tidal flooding is
expected. Minor tidal flooding often results in some road
closures. Usually, the most vulnerable roadways will flood.
Do not leave your vehicle at a location that is prone to tidal
flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flood waters. The
water may be deeper than you think it is. You will be putting
yourself in danger and your vehicle may be damaged, leading to
costly repairs.
Visit the Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service at
water.weather.gov/ahps for additional water level and flood
impact information for your local tide gauge.</instruction>
