<description>...LONG DURATION RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FOR THE NORTHEAST
HIGHLANDS AS WELL AS THE SANDIA, MANZANO, AND GALLINAS MOUNTAINS
THROUGH 9 PM MDT MONDAY DUE TO VERY STRONG WINDS, SEVERAL HOURS
OF SINGLE DIGIT HUMIDITY, ABOVE AVERAGE WARMTH AS WELL AS AN
UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR ALL OTHER AREAS FROM
UNTIL 10 PM MDT TODAY AND AGAIN FROM 9 AM TO 9 PM ON MONDAY DUE
TO STRONG WINDS, LOW HUMIDITY, ABOVE AVERAGE WARMTH AND AN
UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FOR THE CENTRAL MOUNTAIN CHAIN
EASTWARD INTO THE PLAINS OF NEW MEXICO DUE TO STRONG WINDS, LOW
HUMIDITY, ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND AN UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
.A dire and critical to extreme fire weather event is underway.
This long duration of strong, gusty and potentially damaging winds
will continue into Monday along with exceptionally low afternoon
humidity and poor overnight humidity recoveries. Above normal
temperatures will also persist into the middle of the week along
with high Haines indices that will yield very unstable conditions
leading to rapid and potentially catastrophic fire spread and
growth. While winds are expected to decrease in speed some Monday
evening, gusty winds will redevelop over much of the eastern half
of New Mexico on Tuesday, leading to another round of critical
fire weather conditions.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM MDT MONDAY...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH
TUESDAY EVENING...
The National Weather Service in Albuquerque has issued a Fire
Weather Watch...which is in effect from Tuesday morning through
Tuesday evening.
* AREA AND TIMING...Northeast Highlands through 9 PM MDT Monday.
The most critical fire weather conditions will be during the
afternoon and early evening hours. Critical conditions are
expected to redevelop late Tuesday morning through early
evening.
* 20 FOOT WINDS...Southwest winds 30 to 40 mph with potential
gusts of 55 to 75 mph through Monday evening. The highest gusts
will be observed along the east slopes of the Sangre de Cristo
mountains. South southwest winds of 20 to 30 mph with occasional
gusts to 40 mph.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...Ranging from 6 to 15 percent each day with
long duration single digit humidity. In addition, poor overnight
recoveries can be expected.
* IMPACTS...Any fires that develop will spread very rapidly and
will be incredibly difficult to control. In addition, long
range spotting and extreme fire behavior is likely. Outdoor
burning should not be done.</description>
