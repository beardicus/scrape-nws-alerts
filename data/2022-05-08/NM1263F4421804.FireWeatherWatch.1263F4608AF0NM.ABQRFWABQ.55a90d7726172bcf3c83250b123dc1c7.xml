UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...

...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FOR THE CENTRAL MOUNTAIN CHAIN
EASTWARD INTO THE PLAINS OF NEW MEXICO DUE TO STRONG WINDS, LOW
HUMIDITY, ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND AN UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
.A dire and critical to extreme fire weather event is underway.
This long duration of strong, gusty and potentially damaging
winds will continue into Monday along with exceptionally low
afternoon humidity and poor overnight humidity recoveries. Above
normal temperatures will also persist into the middle of the week
along with high Haines indices that will yield very unstable
conditions leading to rapid and potentially catastrophic fire
spread and growth. While winds are expected to decrease in speed
some Monday evening, gusty winds will redevelop over much of the
eastern half of New Mexico on Tuesday, leading to another round
of critical fire weather conditions.
