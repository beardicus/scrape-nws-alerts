<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued May 08 at 2:26AM PDT until May 08 at 11:00PM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM THIS
MORNING TO 11 PM PDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Snow and gusty winds expected. Total snow accumulations
of 4 to 10 inches along the Sierra crest including Donner and
Echo Summits, and 1 to 4 inches below 7,000 feet with the higher
amounts on the west shore of Lake Tahoe. Sustained winds of 20
to 30 mph with gusts to 55 mph and waves of 2 to to 4 feet,
locally up to 5 feet, on Lake Tahoe. Ridgetop winds will exceed
70 mph at times.
* WHERE...Greater Lake Tahoe Area.
* WHEN...From 11 AM this morning to 11 PM PDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Strong winds could
cause tree damage and also reduce visibilities in snow showers.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most likely time for accumulating
snowfall is during the evening hours. However, any convective
snow showers may produce sufficient snowfall rates to result in
an earlier onset for accumulation on the roads. Check with
CalTrans and NDOT for the latest road conditions.</description>
<instruction>Even light snowfall causes major travel delays, especially during
periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to
reach your destination. Leave extra space between vehicles since
it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
