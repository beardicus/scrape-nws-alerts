<headline>High Surf Advisory issued May 08 at 5:36AM EDT until May 12 at 6:00AM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM THIS
AFTERNOON TO 6 AM EDT THURSDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM THIS AFTERNOON
TO 6 AM EDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, 2 to 4 feet of inundation
above ground level expected near vulnerable dune structures. For
the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 10 to 15 feet
expected in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards Statement,
dangerous rip currents, powerful shorebreak, and strong
longshore currents in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Oceanside Outer Banks, north of Cape Hatteras.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, from 2 PM Sunday to 6 AM
EDT Thursday. For the High Surf Advisory, 2 PM Sunday through 6
AM Thursday. For the Beach Hazards Statement, from 8 AM EDT
Sunday through Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...Up to 2 to 4 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible for beach-adjacent properties and roadways, resulting
in a significant threat to life and property. Numerous roads may
be closed, including several sections of NC 12 on Hatteras
Island. Low lying property including homes, businesses, and
some critical infrastructure will be inundated. Dangerous
swimming and surfing conditions and shoreline erosion will
occur. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from
shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw a
swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom causing neck and
back injuries. Strong longshore currents will create dangerous
swimming conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...This will be a long duration event with
conditions deteriorating Sunday afternoon and peaking Monday
through Wednesday, then gradually improving late in the week.
The greatest threat of ocean overwash and inundation will
occur around the times of high tide. Dune erosion will be
progressive and overwash will likely be worse with each
successive high tide.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
