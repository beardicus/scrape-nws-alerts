<headline>High Surf Advisory issued May 08 at 11:18PM EDT until May 10 at 6:00PM EDT by NWS Wakefield</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM EDT
TUESDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM EDT TUESDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, two to three feet of
inundation above ground level expected in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways. For the High Surf Advisory,
large breaking waves of 8 to 12 feet in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Northampton County, both Atlantic Ocean side of the
county as well as portions of the county along eastern shore
of the Chesapeake Bay.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, until 6 AM EDT Tuesday.
For the High Surf Advisory, until 6 PM EDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Widespread flooding of vulnerable areas will result
in an elevated threat of property damage to homes and
businesses near the waterfront and shoreline. Water will be
around 2 feet above ground level in some areas resulting in a
sufficient depth to close numerous roads and threaten homes
and businesses. Flooding will extend inland from the
waterfront along tidal rivers and bays resulting in some road
closures and flooding of vehicles. Large breaking waves
will result in dangerous swimming conditions, beach erosion
and possible damage to dune structures.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
