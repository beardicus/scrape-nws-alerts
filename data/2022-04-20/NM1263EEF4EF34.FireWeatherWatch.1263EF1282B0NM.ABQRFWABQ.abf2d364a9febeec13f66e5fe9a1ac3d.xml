<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued April 20 at 3:17AM MDT until April 21 at 9:00PM MDT by NWS Albuquerque</headline>
<description>...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM TO 9 PM MDT
TODAY FOR ALL OF CENTRAL NEW MEXICO AND THE NORTHEAST HIGHLANDS
DUE TO STRONG WINDS, LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY AND AN UNSTABLE
ATMOSPHERE...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH EARLY
EVENING FOR THE NORTHEAST HIGHLANDS AND NORTHEASTERN PLAINS DUE TO
STRONG WINDS, LOW HUMIDITY AND AN UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
.Mild overnight temperatures and gusty conditions have led to low
morning humidity and poor humidity recoveries. This will set the
stage for critical fire weather today, as west southwest winds
will increase through the late morning and into the afternoon with
widespread gusts of 35 to 45 mph expected. As temperatures warm
10 to 15 degrees above normal this afternoon, humidity will
plummet below 10 percent in many locations.
Windy conditions will redevelop in northeastern New Mexico on
Thursday while above normal temperatures and low humidity persist.
This will once again create the potential for critical fire
weather conditions, mainly across the northeastern highlands and
the northeastern plains of New Mexico Thursday afternoon.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
THURSDAY EVENING...
The National Weather Service in Albuquerque has issued a Fire
Weather Watch...which is in effect from Thursday afternoon
through Thursday evening.
* AREA AND TIMING...Northeast plains Thursday afternoon through
early evening.
* 20 FOOT WINDS...Southwest at 20 to 25 mph with occasional gusts
to 35 mph.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...Dropping to 7 to 10 percent Thursday
afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly.
Outdoor burning is not recommended.</description>
