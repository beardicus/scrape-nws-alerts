<description>...HYDROLOGIC OUTLOOK FOR SNOWMELT AND END OF WEEK RAINFALL...
A multi-day rainfall event this weekend may lead to flooding.
Our Spring 2022 weather conditions have been cooler than normal with above
normal precipitation across northeastern Minnesota and northwestern
Wisconsin. Snowmelt has occurred from south to north in our region leaving
saturated ground where the snowpack has completely melted. A heavy snowpack
remains in the Minnesota Arrowhead and along the International Border
to International Falls. Any rainfall over areas of saturated
ground or heavy snowpack will likely result in efficient runoff leading
to localized flooding.
A strong weather system, expected this Friday and Saturday, will bring
a short period of above normal temperatures to the region. This will
increase the snowmelt rate. Furthermore, heavy rainfall and thunderstorms
are possible with this system which will increase the chances for localized
flooding. Widespread minor flooding is possible due to poor drainage.
Streams and creeks will likely become bankfull and cause minor flooding
as runoff routes to our rivers. River flooding is possible during the
beginning of next week.
The Minnesota Arrowhead has an unusually deep snowpack with high moisture
content. Two feet of snow are common at higher elevation. This snowpack
ranks in the top 10 snowiest winters on record. Areas of the North Shore
in the highest elevation may absorb and store any new rainfall. However,
areas along the slopes of this area will exhibit strong melt in addition
to rainfall. Rapid runoff is possible causing potential flooding impacting
low-lying areas, ditches, culverts in addition to strong river rises.
The Rainy Lake Basin east of Lake of the Woods will likely see localized
flooding due to poor drainage. Strong rises are likely on the Littlefork
River, Big Fork and other drainages flowing north to the Rainy
River.
The Upper Mississippi Headwaters are saw new snow on Wednesday but most
snowpack had melted prior to this event. Again, localized minor flooding
due to poor drainage is likely in the headwaters. Runoff will increase
reservoirs levels throughout the system due to flood control for areas
downstream. Minor river flooding is possible along the Mississippi from
Aitkin to points downstream starting early next week.
The Lake Superior South Shore has snowpack remaining in the Bad River
Basin and the Bayfield Peninsula which could lead to localized flooding
enhanced by runoff and steep terrain.
The evolution of our Spring snowmelt runoff continues and looks to get
very active starting this weekend. If you live by a flood prone area
or immediately adjacent to a river or creek please be aware of water
levels. If you have poor drainage around your home make sure you have
an operating sump pump.</description>
