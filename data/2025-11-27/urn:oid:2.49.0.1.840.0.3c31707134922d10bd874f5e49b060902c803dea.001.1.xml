        <headline>Air Quality Alert issued November 27 at 12:12PM PST by NWS Los Angeles/Oxnard CA</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...The South Coast AQMD has issued an air quality alert due to
harmful levels of particle pollution from windblown dust. Visit
https://www.aqmd.gov/alertinfo to check current and forecasted air
quality levels.

* WHERE...in the The South Coast Air Basin, which includes large
areas of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties
with the exception of the High Desert and the Coachella Valley.
Levels of particle pollution can vary by time and location depending
on emissions and local weather conditions.

* WHEN...Friday.

* IMPACTS... Particle pollution can get deep into the lungs and
cause serious health problems such as asthma attacks, heart and lung
disease symptoms, and increased risk of lung infections. Everyone
can be affected, but sensitive groups such as people with lung or
heart disease, older adults, people who are pregnant, children, and
those who spend a lot of time outdoors are at greater risk.
</description>
        <instruction>To protect your health, check air quality levels and act as needed:

* When Air Quality Index (AQI) levels are "Unhealthy for
Sensitive Groups" (orange), sensitive groups as specified
above should limit extended or intense outdoor activity.
* When AQI is "Unhealthy" (red), everyone may experience health
impacts. Sensitive groups should avoid extended time outdoors.
* When AQI is "Very Unhealthy" (purple), sensitive groups should
avoid all outdoor physical activity. Everyone else should
avoid extended or intense outdoor activity.
* When AQI is "Hazardous" (maroon), everyone should avoid all
outdoor physical activity.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...

To help keep indoor air clean when air quality is poor:

* Keep windows and doors closed
* Run your air conditioner and/or an air purifier
* Do not use whole house fans or swamp coolers that bring in
outside air if you have other methods to stay cool
* Avoid other sources of pollution such as fireplaces, candles,
incense, grilling, and gasoline-powered lawn and garden
equipment

To help minimize outdoor particle pollution levels:

* Carpool, telecommute, reduce trips, or take public
transportation
* Slow down if driving on dirt roads
* Stabilize loose soils</instruction>
