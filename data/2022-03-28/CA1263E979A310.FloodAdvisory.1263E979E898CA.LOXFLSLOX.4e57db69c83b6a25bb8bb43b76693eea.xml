heavy rainfall has bee extended.
* WHERE...A portion of southwest California, including San Luis
Obispo and Santa Barbara, and including the Alisal burn area.
* WHEN...Until 730 AM PDT.

- At 547 AM PDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
continues to indicate moderate to locally heavy rainfall with

Santa Barbara Counties. Rainfall rates with this band have
been observed to be between 0.33 and 0.66 inch per hour.
Locally higher rainfall amounts are possible along the  south
coast of Santa Barbara County. This will cause urban and
small stream flooding and could cause minor mud and debris
flow from the Alisal burn area. Overflowing poor drainage
areas will cause minor flooding in the advisory area.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Santa Maria, San Luis Obispo, Lompoc, Paso Robles, Morro Bay,
Pismo Beach, Santa Ynez, Point Conception, Atascadero, Arroyo
Grande, Nipomo, Cambria, Solvang, Gaviota State Park, Refugio
State Beach, El Capitan State Beach and Grover Beach.

dangers of flooding.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
