<headline>Snow Squall Warning issued March 28 at 12:48PM EDT until March 28 at 1:45PM EDT by NWS State College</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in State College PA has issued a
* Snow Squall Warning for...
Northeastern Schuylkill County in central Pennsylvania...
* Until 145 PM EDT.
* At 1247 PM EDT, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from Mainville to West Hazleton to Nesquehoning, moving
southeast at 20 mph.
HAZARD...Whiteout conditions. Zero visibility in snow and blowing
snow. Wind gusts greater than 30 mph.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Dangerous life-threatening travel.
This includes Interstate 81 from mile markers 119 to 139.
Locations impacted include...
Tamaqua, Shenandoah, St. Clair, Mahanoy City, Frackville, Ashland,
Mcadoo, Girardville, Hometown, Tuscarora, New Philadelphia and
Oneida.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
There is no safe place on a highway when a snow squall hits.
Visibility and traction are immediately lost in whiteout conditions,
making it difficult or impossible to slow down and avoid stopped
vehicles. Delay travel or safely exit the highway before the snow
squall arrives.
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads, bridges
and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and be
prepared for sudden loss of traction.</description>
