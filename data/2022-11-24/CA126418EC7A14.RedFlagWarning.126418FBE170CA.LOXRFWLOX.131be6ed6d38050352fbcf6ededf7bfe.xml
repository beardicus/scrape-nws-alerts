<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FOR WESTERN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND
MUCH OF VENTURA COUNTY THROUGH 11 AM FRIDAY DUE TO GUSTY SANTA ANA
WINDS AND VERY LOW HUMIDITY...
.A moderate to strong Santa Ana event is in full swing this morning with
widespread gusts of 30 to 50 mph across much of Los Angeles and Ventura
Counties. Typically windy spots in the mountains have gusted in the 50
to 65 mph range, with locally higher gusts as high as 90 mph.
Winds will likely peak within the next couple hours before very
slowly weakening this afternoon, albeit remaining quite gusty.
Gusts of 30 to 50 mph will likely continue this afternoon through
tonight, mostly across the mountains and valleys. There will be
more significant weakening after midnight and winds will likely
taper off by late Friday morning, with lingering gusts of 15 to 25
mph possible across favored mountains. Humidity has lowered to
the 6 to 12 percent range across windier areas and will likely
continue through the afternoon. There will be poor overnight
recovery tonight, maxing around 15 to 25 percent, then lower back
down to 8 to 15 percent on Friday. Red flag weather conditions
have been observed for several hours across many weather stations
from the mountains to the coast. There will be continued high
confidence in red flag weather conditions continuing through the
day, and likely continuing through Friday morning for favored
Santa Ana wind locations.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 AM PST FRIDAY FOR
GUSTY NORTHEAST WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR THE WESTERN
LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND EASTERN VENTURA COUNTY MOUNTAINS AND
VALLEYS...
* Winds...Northeast winds 25 to 40 mph with gusts to 60 mph
possible. Local gusts to 75 mph possible over windier mountains
and hills. Strongest through early this afternoon.
* Relative Humidity...Humidity levels mostly in the 5 to 15
percent range.
* Impacts...If fire ignition occurs there could be rapid spread
of wildfire that would lead to a threat to life and property.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now, or will shortly. Use extreme caution
with anything that can spark a wildfire. Residents near wildland
interfaces should be prepared to evacuate if a wildfire breaks
out. See readyforwildfire.org and wildfirerisk.org for
