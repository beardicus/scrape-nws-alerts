<description>...HIGH SURF WARNING FOR NORTH FACING SHORES OF NIIHAU KAUAI OAHU
MOLOKAI MAUI AND BIG ISLAND...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY FOR WEST FACING SHORES OF NIIHAU KAUAI OAHU
MAUI AND BIG ISLAND...
.A large north swell (340-350 degrees) will peak tonight (360-010
degrees). This swell will produce High to XL size surf along the
north- facing shores of Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui and Big
Island through Thanksgiving night. West-facing shores exposed to
large north swell will also experience a significant rise in surf
from north wrap. The swell coincides with strong to gale force
northeast winds, as well as a spring high tide during the early
morning hours Friday. This will likely result in significant
overwash issues within a large wave run up along north-facing
shorelines.
...HIGH SURF WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM HST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Dangerously large breaking waves of 20 to 30 feet along
north-facing shores of Molokai and Big Island.
* WHERE...North-facing shores of Molokai and Big Island. Areas
exposed to north swells on other shorelines should see a
significant rise in surf.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM HST Friday.
* IMPACTS...High. Expect very strong breaking waves and powerful
currents. Waves breaking in channel entrances may make
navigating the channels dangerous. Significant overwash issues
over low-lying roadways and beach erosion will occur with the
large wave run up along north-facing shores</description>
<instruction>Stay away from the shoreline along the affected coasts. Be
prepared for road closures. Postpone entering or leaving channels
affected by the high surf until the surf subsides.</instruction>
