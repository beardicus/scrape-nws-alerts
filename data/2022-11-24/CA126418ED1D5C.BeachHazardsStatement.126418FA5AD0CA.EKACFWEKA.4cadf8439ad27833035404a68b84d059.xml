<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued November 24 at 2:23PM PST until November 25 at 1:00AM PST by NWS Eureka</headline>
<description>...Long Period Swell Moving in Thursday...
Thursday morning the forerunners of a long-period swell are
expected to move into the area. Initially these waves are
expected to be around 6 feet at 18 seconds and quickly build to
over 10 feet at 16 to 18 seconds by late evening.
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM PST FRIDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM TO 1 PM PST
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, High astronomical tides
will cause minor flooding in low lying areas around Humboldt
Bay. Up to one half foot of saltwater inundation above ground
level is possible in low lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways (Between 8.8 and 8.9 feet MLLW at the North Spit tide
gauge). For the Beach Hazards Statement, large unexpected waves
along the coast.
* WHERE...Northern Humboldt Coast County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 11 AM to 1 PM PST
Friday. For the Beach Hazards Statement, until 1 AM PST
Friday.. .
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only isolated
road closures expected. Large, unexpected waves can sweep across
the beach without warning, sweeping people into the sea from
rocks, jetties, and beaches. These waves can also move large
objects such as logs, crushing anyone caught underneath.</description>
<instruction>A Coastal Flood Advisory indicates that onshore winds and tides
will combine to generate flooding of low areas along the shore.
Feet Above Ground is locally defined as feet above the Highest
Astronomical Tide or HAT.
Don`t be fooled by an ocean that looks calm. There can be
30 minutes of small waves before a sneaker wave strikes. Avoid
rocks and jetties. Avoid steep beaches. Stay much farther back
from the water and never turn your back on the ocean.</instruction>
