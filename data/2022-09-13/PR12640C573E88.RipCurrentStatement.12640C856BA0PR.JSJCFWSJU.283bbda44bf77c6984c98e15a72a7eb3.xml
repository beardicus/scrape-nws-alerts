<headline>Rip Current Statement issued September 13 at 4:38AM ADT until September 16 at 7:00AM ADT by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE THURSDAY NIGHT...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Dangerous rip currents expected due to breaking waves to
around 6 feet. Breaking waves will peak between 6 and 11 feet
today.
* WHERE...Beaches of Aguada and Rincon.
* WHEN... For the High Rip Current Risk, through late Thursday
night. For the High Surf Advisory, through 6 PM AST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming conditions. Rip currents can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper
water. Hazardous breaking waves are expected and isolated
beach erosion is possible.</description>
<instruction>A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in
the advisory area, producing localized beach erosion and
dangerous swimming conditions.
There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.</instruction>
