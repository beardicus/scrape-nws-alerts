<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of central, north central, southeast, and west
central New Mexico, including the following areas, in central New
Mexico, Eastern Lincoln County, San Agustin Plains and Adjacent
Lowlands and South Central Mountains. In north central New Mexico,
East Slopes Sangre de Cristo Mountains, Jemez Mountains, Northwest

New Mexico, Southwest Chaves County. In west central New Mexico,
San Francisco River Valley, Southwest Mountains, West Central
Highlands, West Central Mountains and West Central Plateau.
* WHEN...Through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Low-water
crossings may be flooded. Storm drains and ditches may become
clogged with debris.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Numerous thunderstorms are expected over the area this
afternoon and evening. Rainfall rates over one inch per hour
are likely, with the potential for flash flooding. Areas
where the ground is already saturated from recent heavy
rainfall, locations with steep terrain, and recent wildfire
burn scars will be especially susceptible to flash flooding.
