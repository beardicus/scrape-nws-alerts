<headline>Hydrologic Outlook issued September 13 at 7:50PM ChST  by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL POSSIBLE ...
This Hydrologic Outlook is for Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan in
the Mariana Islands. This will be the last outlook issued for this
potential rainfall event.
Tropical Depression 16W continues to move slowly to the northeast,
and is located 755 miles to the northwest of Saipan. It`s forecast
to continue to move ever so slowly to the northeast over the next 48
hours. As it does so, a south to southwesterly monsoon flow will
persist across the Marianas and the CNMI over the next few days, with
another weak circulation potentially developing Friday near Pagan,
which could extend the monsoon flow duration into the weekend.
As for rainfall totals issued in earlier forecasts, they remain
on track; an area-wide 3 to 5 inches of rainfall, with locally
higher amounts possible, still forecast to occur between late tonight
and Friday. However, these amounts are slightly below Flash Flood
Watch issuance thresholds. That said, some flash flood warnings or
flood advisories remain a possibility during this time.
Closely monitor this developing situation in the event watches,
advisories, or warnings are needed. Forecasts will likely change in
the next few days.
Make sure nearby storm drains are not clogged, especially for
low-lying or flood-prone areas.</description>
