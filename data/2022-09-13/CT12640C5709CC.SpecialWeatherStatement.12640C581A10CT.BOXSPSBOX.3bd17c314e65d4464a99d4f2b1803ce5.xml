<description>...Areas of Fog to Reduce Visibility This Morning...
Areas of fog have developed early this morning across eastern
Connecticut, much of Rhode Island into eastern Massachusetts.
Visibilities in fog have been as low as one-quarter mile at times,
but are more commonly between one-half to four miles. Fog and
areas of low clouds are expected to linger into the mid morning
hours as advancing rain moves into the area.
Motorists should expect to encounter sudden changes in visibility
in areas of fog this morning. Fog could hamper travel for the
Tuesday morning commute. Use low beam headlights and keep a safe
distance between your vehicle and the one in front of you.</description>
