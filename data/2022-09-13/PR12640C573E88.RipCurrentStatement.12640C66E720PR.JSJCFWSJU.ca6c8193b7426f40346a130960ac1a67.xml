<headline>Rip Current Statement issued September 13 at 4:38AM ADT until September 14 at 7:00AM ADT by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Dangerous surf conditions and rip currents expected due
to breaking waves around 6 feet, with occasionally greater
heights.
* WHERE...Northern beaches of Vieques.
* WHEN...through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming conditions. Rip currents can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper
water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A long period northerly swell is forecast
to reach the Atlantic coastal waters of the islands by this
evening. This swell could suddenly produce larger breaking
waves along the northern beaches of Puerto Rico during the
afternoon hours.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.</instruction>
