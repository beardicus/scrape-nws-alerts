<headline>Special Weather Statement issued September 13 at 6:50AM AKDT  by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>...Very Stormy from Wednesday Night Through Thursday...
From Wednesday into the weekend, a series of very strong Bering
Sea storms will bring gales and heavy rain to Western Alaska. A
weak low now over Kamchatka will deepen rapidly and move to the
Central Bering Sea on Wed, and to the Northern Bering Sea on Thu.
This will spread rain to the West Coast Wed night and Thu. This
will bring southeast winds of 25 to 35 mph to the West Coast Wed
night, and south winds 25 to 35 mph on Thu. This could cause high
surf with minor coastal flooding along the West Coast south of the
Bering Strait from Thu into early Fri.
A second and stronger storm, with the remnants of Tropical Storm
Merbok, will move north into the Central Bering Sea on Fri and to
along the West Coast on Sat. Weather models vary significantly on
the track of this feature, and so it is too early to say much
about it except that it will bring very strong winds and heavy
rain to most of the West Coast over the weekend. This will also
bring a possibility of coastal flooding south of the Bering Strait
Fri PM into Sun AM, but there is still much uncertainty about
coastal flooding.</description>
