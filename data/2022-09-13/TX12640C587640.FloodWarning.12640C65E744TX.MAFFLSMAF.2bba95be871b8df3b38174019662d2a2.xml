County.
...The Flood Warning is cancelled for the following rivers in

.High flows coming out of the Rio Conchos and into the Rio Grande
over the next week are expected to result in considerable flooding
of the Rio Grande from Presidio downstream through Big Bend National
Park.
For the Rio Grande...including Presidio International Bridge,
Presidio 5SE...Moderate flooding is forecast.  For Castolon, Johnson
Ranch...Minor flooding is forecast.
...FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch.
* WHEN...Until further notice.
* IMPACTS...At 12.0 feet (3.7 meters), the river reaches bankfull,
minor lowland flooding occurs, and no significant damage is
expected.
At 15.0 feet (4.6 meters), flood stage is reached.  Moderate
lowland flooding begins.  Roads that lead to Cottonwood Campground
and River Road may flood.  Stages are practically synonymous with
the gage at Cottonwood Campground at Castolon (CSTT2), and
therefore represent the reach from Santa Elena Canyon through
Cottonwood Campground, where damage may occur.  Cattle also graze
in the lowlands, and may be threatened.
