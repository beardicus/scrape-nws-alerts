<description>...STRONG WINDS AND HIGH SURF EXPECTED ACROSS THE KUSKOKWIM DELTA
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...
A potent storm system, the extra-tropical remnants of Typhoon
Merbok, is expected to move from the Northern Pacific Thursday
through the Southern Bering Thursday night and Friday morning
into the Northern Bering Sea for late Friday into Saturday. This
system will undergo rapid cyclogenesis as it moves through the
Bering Sea, deepening from 965 mb Thursday to around 945 mb by
Friday afternoon. While there is still some uncertainty on the
exact track and strength of this system, model guidance is
converging on a track taking the low from near Attu Island
Thursday afternoon to Saint Matthew Island by Saturday morning.
For the Kuskokwim Delta, winds are expected to increase by late
morning Friday and continue through Saturday morning before
slowly diminishing Saturday night. Sustained winds of 40 to 55
mph with higher gusts are possible, especially along the Kuskokwim
Delta coast. The combination of strong winds and fetch will also
produce a storm surge along the Kuskokwim Delta coast, leading to
the potential for coastal erosion and flooding. Current guidance
is indicating a potential surge of 5 to 7 feet above mean higher
high water (grassline) along the entirety of the Kuskokwim Delta
coast, including Kuskokwim Bay.
We will continue to closely monitor this storm. Those with
interests on or near the Kuskokwim Delta Coast should keep close
tabs on this storm and be prepared to take protective actions.
