<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued February 17 at 5:51PM CST until February 17 at 9:00PM CST by NWS Saint Louis</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM CST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Additional snow accumulations up to one inch.
* WHERE...In Missouri, Lincoln MO, Montgomery MO and Pike MO
Counties. In Illinois, Calhoun IL and Greene IL Counties.
* WHEN...Until 9 PM CST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will
likely become slick and hazardous. Plan on slippery road
conditions. The hazardous conditions could impact the Thursday
evening commute.</description>
<instruction>The rapid accumulation of snow will make travel extremely difficult,
if not impossible. If travel is necessary, be sure to exercise
extreme caution. If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food
and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency. In Illinois, the
latest road conditions can be obtained at
www.gettingaroundillinois.com. In Missouri, the latest road
conditions can be obtained at traveler.modot.org/map or by calling
1-888-275-6636.
Travel will become dangerous once the freezing rain begins. Travel
is strongly discouraged unless it is an emergency. Avoid any downed
power lines and be ready in case of a loss of power. Untreated roads
and bridges, sidewalks, and parking lots will be treacherous.
It only takes a small amount of sleet to make roads, bridges,
sidewalks and parking lots icy and dangerous. Plan for a slow trip
and use caution when approaching turns, bridges and overpasses.
Remain alert for rapid changes in road conditions.</instruction>
