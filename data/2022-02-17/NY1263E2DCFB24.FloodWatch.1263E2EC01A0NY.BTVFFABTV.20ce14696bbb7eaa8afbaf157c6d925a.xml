<headline>Flood Watch issued February 17 at 2:53PM EST until February 18 at 1:00PM EST by NWS Burlington</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH FRIDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and/or snowmelt and/or ice jam
continues to be possible.
* WHERE...Northern New York and Vermont
* WHEN...Through Friday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Low-water
crossings may be flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The combination of snow melt and moderate to heavy rainfall
will lead to sharp rises on many streams and rivers. These
expected rises may produce open river flooding and will
produce some river ice break up increasing the risk for
localized ice jam flooding from tonight into Friday. At this
time, at least minor river flooding is likely at the Mad
River at Moretown, Otter Creek at Center Rutland, the East
Branch of the Ausable at Ausable Forks, and moderate flood
stage is possible at these locations. Minor flooding is
possible at the Winooski at Essex Junction. Ice jam prone
river, such as the Ausable, Saranac, Lamoille, Winooski, and
the Mad River will be closely monitored. Rainfall totals will
range from about three quarters of an inch in the Connecticut
River valley up to two inches in parts of Northern New York
where isolated higher amounts are possible as well.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
