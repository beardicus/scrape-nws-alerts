* WHEN...Until 100 AM EST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying

Depending on ice behavior, any release of the ice jam could result
in sudden rises of water, leading to a rapid flooding situation.

beginning to break up on creeks flowing into Silver Creek.

across the warned area.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 1.5 inches are possible
in the warned area. The additional rainfall will increase
flows and cause levels to rise on other creeks and streams.
