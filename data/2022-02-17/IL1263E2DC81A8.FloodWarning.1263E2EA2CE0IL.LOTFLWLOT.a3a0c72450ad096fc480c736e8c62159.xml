<headline>Flood Warning issued February 17 at 10:42AM CST until further notice by NWS Chicago</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Chicago IL has issued a Flood
Warning for the following rivers in Illinois...
Kankakee River near Wilmington affecting Will, Kankakee and
Grundy Counties.
For the Kankakee River...including Wilmington...Moderate flooding is
forecast.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM THIS MORNING UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE...
...REPLACES RIVER FLOOD ADVISORY...
...FLASH FLOOD WARNING ALSO IN EFFECT FOR PORTION OF THE AREA...
* WHAT...Minor to moderate flooding due to a combination of rain,
snowmelt, and river ice. Moderate flooding is expected near an ice
jam.
* WHERE...Kankakee River from confluence with Iroquois River
downstream to confluence with the Illinois River, including the
Wilmington gauge. The most significant flooding is expected
downstream of Wilmington near I-55 where an ice jam is occurring.
* WHEN...From this morning until further notice.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 9:45 AM CST Thursday the stage was 9.2 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to continuing rising into
the weekend. Near the Wilmington gauge, an ice jam has
rapidly worsened, leading to localized flooding. Water levels
near the ice jam are expected to remain above flood stage
while the ice jam is in place, but may begin to fall
elsewhere by early next week.
- Flood stage is 6.5 feet.

&amp;&amp;</description>
<instruction>These forecasts are based on observed precipitation as well as
forecast precipitation 48 hours into the future. Changes to the
rainfall forecast, or any additional rainfall after 48 hours, may
cause changes to these river forecasts.
An ice jam is affecting water levels in the area. River forecasts
during ice jams are less certain due to many complicated factors.
Significant river ice cover can cause large water level fluctuations
and flooding with little advanced notice. River ice may also cause
gauge observations to be inaccurate.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov/Chicago and
water.weather.gov
The next statement is expected tonight.</instruction>
