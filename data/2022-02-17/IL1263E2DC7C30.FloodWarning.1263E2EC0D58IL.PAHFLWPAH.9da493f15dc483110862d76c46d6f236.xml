<senderName>NWS Paducah (Southern Illinois and Indiana, Southeastern Missouri and Western Kentucky)</senderName>
<headline>Flood Warning issued February 17 at 10:28AM CST until further notice by NWS Paducah</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Paducah KY has issued a Flood
Warning for the following rivers in Indiana...Illinois...
Wabash River at New Harmony affecting Wabash, Posey, White,
Gibson and Gallatin Counties.
.Heavy rainfall today will lead to rises on area rivers including
the Wabash River. Much of this rain is falling on snow and frozen
ground in the upper parts of the basin so not only will we see
flooding from rain in southern Indiana but the combination of rain
and melting snow moving downstream will keep the lower parts of the
Wabash in flood for the next couple of weeks.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY AFTERNOON UNTIL FURTHER
NOTICE...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Wabash River at New Harmony.
* WHEN...From Saturday afternoon until further notice.
* IMPACTS...At 20.0 feet, Parts of northern New Harmony begin to
flood and sandbagging becomes necessary in town.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 9:30 AM CST Thursday the stage was 9.6 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above flood stage
early Saturday afternoon and continue rising to 19.7 feet
Sunday, February 27. Additional rises are possible
thereafter.
- Flood stage is 15.0 feet.
