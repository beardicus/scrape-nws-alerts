<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.
Never drive vehicles through flooded areas. The water may be too
deep to allow safe passage. Never allow children to play in or near
flood waters. Stay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio or local media for
further statements and updated forecasts.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Detailed river forecasts and additional information can be found at
www.weather.gov/iwx under Rivers and Lakes.
This statement will be updated within the next 12 to 24 hours.</instruction>
