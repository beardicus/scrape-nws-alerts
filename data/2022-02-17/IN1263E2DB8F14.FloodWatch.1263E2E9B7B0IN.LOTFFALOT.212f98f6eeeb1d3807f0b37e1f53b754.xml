<headline>Flood Watch issued February 17 at 5:21AM EST until February 17 at 10:00PM EST by NWS Chicago</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 AM CST/8 AM EST/ THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by heavy rain, snowmelt, and break-up ice
jams continues to be possible through early this morning.
* WHERE...Portions of east central Illinois including Ford and
Iroquois Counties and portions of northwest Indiana including
Benton, Jasper and Newton Counties.
* WHEN...Until 7 AM CST/8 AM EST/ this morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Some rivers are
forecast to go above flood stage based upon current forecast
rainfall. Rising river levels may result in river ice becoming
dislodged, increasing the risk of localized break-up ice jams.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rainfall of one to locally one and a quarter inches will have
fallen through early this morning, in addition to runoff from
melting snow. Frozen ground may lead to quick runoff.

creeks, and other waterways should monitor the latest forecasts and
be prepared to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
