<headline>Flood Watch issued February 17 at 10:33PM EST until February 18 at 1:00PM EST by NWS Albany</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH FRIDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and/or snowmelt and/or ice jam
continues to be possible.
* WHERE...The southern Adirondacks, Mohawk Valley, Schoharie Valley,
eastern Catskills, Capital District, Lake George Saratoga Region,
and southern Vermont.
* WHEN...Through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The combination of snowmelt, frozen ground and rainfall will
lead to runoff into rivers and streams tonight into Friday.
This runoff may allow for river ice to break up in some
areas, which could cause ice jams and lead to localized
flooding. In addition, a few rivers may reach minor flood
stage and the Mettawee River at Granville could reach
moderate flood stage. Flooding of poor drainage areas is also
possible, especially where snow or ice clogs storm drains.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
