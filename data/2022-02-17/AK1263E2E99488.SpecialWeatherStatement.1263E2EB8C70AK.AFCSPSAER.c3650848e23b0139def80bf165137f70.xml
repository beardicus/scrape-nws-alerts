<description>...MIXED RAIN AND SNOW THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING...
Heavy precipitation continues through 3 AM, tapering off by
mid-morning. Rain is falling across most of the lower elevations
along the Kenai Peninsula, though Kenai and areas nearby continue
to hang on to the colder temperatures producing snow on the
ground. Snow will hang on along the Sterling Highway north of
Clam Gulch and the Seward Highway north of Kenai Lake as well.
The rain may mix with or change back over to snow by early Friday
morning as the precipitation comes to an end.
Up to 2 inches of snow are possible along the Sterling Highway
north of Clam Gulch, with the 2 inch total most likely near Kenai
where temperatures are starting the day in the upper 20s. Many
areas may either see snow will melt on contact with the ground. 1
to 5 inches of accumulation are possible through Turnagain Pass
and Portage Valley, with the higher amounts through the Pass.
Strong southeasterly wind gusts are also likely across Portage
Valley and Turnagain Pass today. However, with temperatures around
freezing, blowing snow is not expected to be a concern.</description>
