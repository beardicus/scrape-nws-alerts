<description>...ANOTHER ROUND OF MIXED RAIN AND SNOW LATE THIS MORNING THROUGH
FRIDAY MORNING...
The active weather pattern will continue today with another storm
system moving across Southcentral Alaska. Precipitation will
overspread the Kenai Peninsula beginning late this morning. The
precipitation is expected to begin as rain/snow mix for the
northern half of the Kenai Peninsula, including the Sterling
Highway north of Clam Gulch and the Seward Highway north of Kenai
Lake. Any mix is expected to transition to all rain by late
morning today as temperatures climb into the mid to upper 30s.
The rain may mix with or change back over to snow by early Friday
morning as the precipitation comes to an end.
Up to 2 inches of snow are possible along the Sterling Highway
north of Clam Gulch, with the 2 inch total most likely near Kenai
where temperatures are starting the day in the upper 20s. Many
areas may either see all rain or the snow will melt on contact
with the ground. 1 to 5 inches of accumulation are possible
through Turnagain Pass and Portage Valley, with the higher amounts
through the Pass. Strong southeasterly wind gusts are also likely
across Portage Valley and Turnagain Pass today. However, with
temperatures around freezing, blowing snow is not expected to be a
concern.</description>
