<senderName>NWS Buffalo (Western New York)</senderName>
<headline>Flood Watch issued February 17 at 10:08AM EST until February 18 at 1:00PM EST by NWS Buffalo</headline>
<description>.Moderate to heavy rain will continue to fall on a deep primed
snowpack leading to the melt increasing. Flows in rivers are
expected to increase quickly and reach critical levels.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH FRIDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by runoff from widespread rain and rapid
snowmelt continues to be possible.
* WHERE...A portion of western New York, including the following
counties, Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Genesee, Livingston,
Monroe, Niagara, Northern Erie, Orleans, Southern Erie and Wyoming.
* WHEN...Through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff from rain and snow melt may result in
flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and
flood-prone locations. The greatest threat for flooding will be in
ice jam prone areas, such as the Buffalo area creeks and near
Sunset Bay on Cattaraugus creek. Creeks and streams may rise out
of their banks.  Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban
areas. Flood warnings have already been issued in some areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Ice will continue to break up on area creeks through the day,
with a risk of ice jams at typically vulnerable locations.
Then steadier rain will continue through the day, resulting
in more significant and widespread rises on area creeks and
rivers. The system will generate between an inch and inch and
a half of rain before changing over to ice and snow this
evening, then ending late tonight.
The greatest risk for flooding is later today and tonight,
when run-off from the rain and snow melt will peak.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop. This is especially the case
for those living in ice jam prone areas along the Buffalo area
creeks and Cattaraugus creek. Others that have experienced ice jam
flooding in the past should also be extra vigilant during this
period.</instruction>
