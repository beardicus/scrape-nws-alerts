accumulations of 4 to 7 inches and ice accumulations of up to
one tenth of an inch. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph. Rain will

difficult conditions for driving by Friday morning. Standing
water from earlier rainfall will also pose a risk of icy
conditions tonight into Friday morning. Snow will reduce
visibility tonight. The snow will taper off early Friday
morning, but roads will remain very slippery through the Friday
morning commute.</description>
<instruction>Widespread accumulating snow and ice will create dangerous travel
conditions. If you need to be out, use extra caution while
