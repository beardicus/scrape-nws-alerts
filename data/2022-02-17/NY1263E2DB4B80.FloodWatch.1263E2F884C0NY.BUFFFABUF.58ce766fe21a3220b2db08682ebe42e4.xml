<headline>Flood Watch issued February 17 at 3:48AM EST  by NWS Buffalo</headline>
<description>.The combination of widespread rain and rapid snowmelt will result
in excessive runoff today and tonight. This will produce significant
rises and potential flooding on area rivers, creeks, and in poor
drainage areas.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH FRIDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by runoff from widespread rain and rapid
snowmelt continues to be possible.
* WHERE...A portion of western New York, including the following
counties, Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Genesee, Livingston,
Monroe, Niagara, Northern Erie, Orleans, Southern Erie and Wyoming.
* WHEN...Through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...There is increasing confidence that excessive runoff may
result in flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations. The greatest threat for flooding will
be in ice jam prone areas, such as the Buffalo area creeks and
near Sunset Bay on Cattaraugus creek. Creeks and streams may rise
out of their banks. Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban
areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Ice will begin to break up on area creeks through this
morning, with a risk of ice jams at typically vulnerable
locations. Then steadier rain will move in later this
morning, resulting in more significant and widespread rises
on area creeks and rivers. The system will generate between
an inch and inch and a half of rain before changing over to
ice and snow this evening, then ending late tonight. The
greatest risk for flooding is later today and tonight, when
run-off from the rain and snow-melt will peak.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
