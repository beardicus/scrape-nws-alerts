<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM EST THIS AFTERNOON
THROUGH FRIDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt or an ice jam
continues to be possible.
* WHERE...Northern New York and Vermont.
* WHEN...From 1 PM EST this afternoon through Friday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Low-water
crossings may be flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The combination of snow melt and moderate to heavy rainfall
will lead to sharp rises on many streams and rivers. A few
river gages may reach minor flood stage by Friday. In
addition, these expected rises will produce some river ice
break up increasing the risk for localized ice jam flooding
from tonight into Friday. Rivers we are closely monitoring
include Ausable, Saranac, Salmon, Lamoille, Winooski, Mad and
Otter Creek. Rainfall totals will range from about three
quarters of an inch in the Connecticut River valley up to two
inches in parts of Northern New York where isolated higher
amounts are possible as well.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
