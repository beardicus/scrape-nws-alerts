<description>...Very Hot Over The Eastern Interior Through Monday...
...High Water On The Tanana River Into Next Week...
The Eastern Interior will become very hot this weekend with
isolated afternoon thunderstorms. Temperatures are in the 80s
over most of the Eastern Interior today, and will rise into the
80s and low 90s on Sunday and Monday. Fairbanks is expected to
reach 90 on Sunday and Monday. Similar hot conditions with
isolated afternoon thunderstorms will likely continue over the
Eastern Interior into the middle of next week. People should take
precautions against heat this weekend.
The Tanana River is near bankfull, and will remain very high
through next week. This high water is due to rising freezing
levels adding high elevation snow and glacial melt this weekend
into next week. Other glacial rivers draining the Alaska Range
such as the Delta and Nenana Rivers will also remain very high
into next week. Most gravel bars on the Tanana River will be
covered by water, and some normally dry sloughs and other low
lying areas will fill with water. These glacial rivers will
contain an increased numbers of logs and trees floating down them
through next week and boaters should use caution. The sustained
high water could cause erosion problems along the Tanana, Delta
and Nenena Rivers through next week.
Thunderstorms today and Sunday could contain hail and winds
gusting to 30 mph. Strong thunderstorms with heavy rainfall are
possible Monday and Tuesday which could cause flash flooding in
steep terrain of the Alaska and Brooks Ranges, and flooding if
they occur over the already bankfull glacial rivers in the Tanana
Valley.</description>
