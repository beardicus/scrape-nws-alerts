<headline>Air Quality Alert issued July 22 at 1:03PM CDT  by NWS Duluth</headline>
<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM CDT THIS AFTERNOON TO 6
PM CDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has issued an Air
Quality Alert for fine particles pollution. The Air Quality
Index (AQI) is expected to reach the Orange or Unhealthy for
Sensitive Groups category.
* WHERE...North central and northeast Minnesota.
* WHEN...From 4 PM CDT this afternoon to 6 PM CDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease
(including asthma), heart disease, and children and older
adults, may experience health effects.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A narrow band of heavy smoke located across
southern Manitoba will be transported towards Minnesota by
northwest winds. This smoke originated from wildfires in
northern Alberta and British Columbia. Ground-level smoke will
reach northern Minnesota by 4 PM on Saturday, behind a cold
front. Fine particle levels will reach the Orange (Unhealthy for
Sensitive Groups) category across north central Minnesota by
late afternoon Saturday and will persist through the overnight.
On Sunday, as the smoke band continues to move across northern
Minnesota additional smoke will reach the ground across
northeast and central Minnesota. As daytime heating increases
surface temperatures and mixes the atmosphere, elevated smoke
will reach the ground around midday. Fine particle levels will
be in the Orange category across northern and central Minnesota
on Sunday. Winds will become westerly on Monday. The area of
ground-level smoke will begin to move east and exit the state.
Air quality should improve by Monday morning across central and
north central Minnesota. However, air quality is expected to
remain in the Orange category across northeast Minnesota on
Monday.

<instruction>Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including
asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults, should
limit prolonged or heavy exertion. Reduce or eliminate activities
that contribute to air pollution, such as outdoor burning, and use
of residential wood burning devices. Reduce vehicle trips and
vehicle idling as much as possible. Keep windows closed overnight
to prevent smoke from getting indoors.</instruction>
