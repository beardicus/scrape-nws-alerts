<headline>Air Quality Alert issued July 22 at 12:29PM PDT  by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM PDT MONDAY...
The Flat Fire near Agness combined with periods of westerly winds
will cause smoke concentrations to increase to the east. Air Quality
is expected to reach unhealthy levels at times in southern Curry and
Josephine County and Jackson County, but can fluctuate depending on
the weather.
Even though the air quality in the Medford-Ashland areas will be
good today into Sunday afternoon, it`s expected to worsen Sunday
night as the winds shift northwesterly bringing the smoke from the
Flat Fire into the area. This will result in moderate to poor air
quality.
Check current conditions on the Oregon Smoke Information Blog
oregonsmoke.org, DEQ’s Air Quality Index, or by downloading the free
OregonAIR app on your smartphone.
- Smoke can irritate the eyes and lungs and worsen some medical
conditions. People most at risk include infants and young children,
people with heart or lung disease, older adults and pregnant
people.
- Protect yourself and your family when smoke levels are high:
- Stay inside if possible. Keep windows and doors closed. If it’s too
hot, run air conditioning on recirculate or consider moving to a
cooler location. Avoid strenuous outdoor activity.
- Use a high efficiency particulate air(HEPA) filter in indoor
ventilation systems or portable air purifiers.
- Be aware of smoke in your area and avoid places with the highest
levels.
- If you have a breathing plan for a medical condition, be sure to
follow it and keep any needed medications refilled.
