<headline>Flood Advisory issued April 12 at 1:47AM MDT until further notice by NWS Billings</headline>
<description>.Snow melt from the base of the Little Belt and Crazy Mountains has
resulted in minor flooding across portions of western Wheatland
County. Minor flooding will linger due to yesterday`s very warm
temperatures.
...FLOOD ADVISORY FOR SNOWMELT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 330 PM MDT
THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Small stream flooding caused by snowmelt continues.
* WHERE...A portion of central Montana, including the following
county, Wheatland.
* WHEN...Until 330 PM MDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding of small creeks and streams, low-lying
areas, and culverts. Rural roads and bridges may be washed out or
damaged. Livestock may become stranded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 140 AM MDT, flooding persists along Lebo Creek south of
Two Dot, and Haymaker Creek north of Two Dot. A few rural
roads have been washed out in spots. Culverts are overflowing
in some areas.
- Reports indicate flooding is mainly in the Two Dot and
Martinsdale vicinities, but the Harlowton area could see
small creeks flooding as well. Although a cold front ushered
in cooler temperatures overnight, lingering snowmelt from
