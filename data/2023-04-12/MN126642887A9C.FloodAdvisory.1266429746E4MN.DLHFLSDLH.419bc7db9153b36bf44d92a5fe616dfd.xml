<headline>Flood Advisory issued April 12 at 3:47PM CDT until further notice by NWS Duluth</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY FOR SNOWMELT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1230 PM CDT
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by snowmelt continues.
* WHERE...Portions of east central Minnesota, north central
Minnesota and northeast Minnesota, including the following areas,
in east central Minnesota, Aitkin, Crow Wing and Pine. In north
central Minnesota, Cass and Itasca. In northeast Minnesota,
Carlton and St. Louis.
* WHEN...Until 1230 PM CDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
River or stream flows are elevated. Multiple county, forest, or
township roads may become flooded, especially those in low lying
areas. Check with your county for additional information.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 341 PM CDT, Spring snowmelt will continue with above
normal temperatures this week. A near record amount of water
stored in the snowpack will be released.  This will cause
rapid snowmelt runoff leading to ponding of water and quick
rises on streams and rivers.  Minor flooding is expected in
the advisory area.
- Flood safety information can be found at
www.weather.gov/safety/flood.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and to the National Weather Service in Duluth when you
can do so safely. Flooding can be reported to the National Weather
Service at 1-800-685-8612.</instruction>
