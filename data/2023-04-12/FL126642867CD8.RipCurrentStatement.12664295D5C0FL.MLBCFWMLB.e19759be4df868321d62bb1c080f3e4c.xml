<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM EDT THIS
AFTERNOON...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE TONIGHT...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 6 to
8 feet expected in the surf zone. For the High Rip Current
Risk, dangerous rip currents expected.
* WHERE...Coastal Volusia County.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 4 PM EDT this
afternoon. For the High Rip Current Risk, through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and

swimmers away from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>High surf will affect the beaches in the advisory area, producing
localized beach erosion and dangerous swimming conditions.
Swimmers should remain out of the water due to large breaking
waves and dangerous surf conditions.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as jetties and
piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs. Entering the surf is not advised.</instruction>
