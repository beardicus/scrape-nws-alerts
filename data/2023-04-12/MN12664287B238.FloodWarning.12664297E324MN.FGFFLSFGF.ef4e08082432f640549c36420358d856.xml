.Temperatures above freezing over the last several days is creating
snow melt, with some areas in the southern basin seeing most of the
snowpack melted. High temperatures on Wednesday will range from the
low 50s, to the upper 60s in forested areas. This is expected to
further ripen the snow pack where it still exists and, with
anticipated melting, will cause increased flows of water into the
rivers.  There will be variations as to degree of snow melt
depending on how high temperatures will get over the next several
days. This will impact rate of rise in many locations, with some
rivers responding quickly and other forecast points seeing a delay
in rising levels. At this time, precipitation will be limited.
However, if rainfall occurs later over the next few days, it will
have an impact on forecast rises.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
