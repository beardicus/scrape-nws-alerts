<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO 8 PM
CDT THIS EVENING FOR WIND AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR FAR
SOUTHEAST SOUTH DAKOTA, NORTHWEST IOWA AND FAR SOUTHERN MINNESOTA...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
THURSDAY EVENING FOR WIND AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR PORTIONS
OF SOUTHEAST SOUTH DAKOTA, NORTHWEST IOWA, AND SOUTHWEST MINNESOTA...
.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 306 AM CDT Wed Apr 12 2023
Main channel of strongest winds shifts a bit southeastward today
compared to yesterday with the best chances of gusts in the 25-35
mph near and southeast of a Yankton to Jackson line. Outside of
this area, afternoon relative humidity values will still work into
critical thresholds near and south of I-90. Fire Weather Watch
was converted to a Red Flag Warning for a few counties but
remaining counties look to hold short of the wind criteria
component. Certainly a trend to monitor through the morning
however as conditions remain elevated either way.
Corridor of strongest winds lifts back to the northwest for Thursday
and strengthens further. Forecast guidance continues to show the
potential for wind gusts in the 30-40+ mph range, strongest across
NW IA. More mixed guidance such as the RAP/HRRR which has been
verifying best would also push RH values at or below critical
thresholds for locations southeast of a Tyndall to Brookings line.
Will go ahead an issue a Fire Weather Watch for highest confidence
zones but this will need to be reevaluated as fuel conditions from
areas of recent snowmelt are evaluated as well as refinement on
where the meandering boundary ends up.
A strong cold front will push through Friday bringing falling
temperatures and precipitation chances.
People are urged to exercise extreme care with respect to outdoor
activities that could cause grass fires. Avoid equipment that can
cause sparks near dry grass or brush. Do not toss cigarettes on
the ground. Report new fires quickly to the nearest fire
department or law enforcement office.
...EXTREME FIRE DANGER...
The Grassland Fire Danger Index will reach the extreme category
this afternoon. Extreme weather conditions and very low
moisture content of grasses, and other dry organic material
on the ground, indicate that critical burning conditions exist.
All fires have the potential to become large and spread quickly,
becoming erratic with extreme behavioral characteristics.
No outdoor burning should take place.
OUTLOOK FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON...The Grassland Fire Danger Index
will reach the extreme category.
The grassland fire danger product reflects fire danger for native
grasses. It is not intended for cured agricultural crops, nor
will it reflect conditions in road ditches which have been mowed.</description>
