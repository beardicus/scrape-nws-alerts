<headline>High Surf Advisory issued May 26 at 4:10PM EDT until May 28 at 4:00AM EDT by NWS Wakefield</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 10 PM THIS EVENING TO 4 AM
EDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents and
large breaking waves. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking
waves of 8 to 10 feet expected in the surf zone.
* WHERE...In North Carolina, Eastern Currituck County. In
Virginia, Virginia Beach.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, through Sunday
evening. For the High Surf Advisory, from 10 PM this evening
to 4 AM EDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore
break can throw a swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom
causing neck and back injuries.</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
