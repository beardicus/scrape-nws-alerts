<headline>Special Weather Statement issued May 26 at 4:38PM EDT  by NWS Miami</headline>
<description>...A strong thunderstorm will impact portions of northwestern Palm
Beach County through 530 PM EDT...
At 438 PM EDT, National Weather Service meteorologists were tracking
a strong thunderstorm capable of producing a waterspout over Lake
Okeechobee 8 miles northwest of Pahokee, moving southeast at 10 mph.
HAZARD...Waterspouts, wind gusts of 50 to 55 mph, and half inch
hail.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Waterspouts can easily overturn boats and create locally
hazardous waters. Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs
and blow around unsecured objects. Minor damage to outdoor
objects is possible.
Locations impacted include...
Belle Glade, Pahokee, South Bay, Canal Point, Lake Harbor, Fremd
Village-Padgett Island and Belle Glade Camp.
WATERSPOUT...POSSIBLE
LIGHTNING...EXCESSIVE
MAX HAIL SIZE...0.50 IN
MAX WIND GUST...55 MPH</description>
<instruction>Funnel clouds can touch down and produce waterspouts. Although
typically weak and short lived, a landfalling waterspout can cause
property damage and serious injury.
Torrential rainfall is also occurring with this storm and may lead to
localized flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flooded
roadways.
Persons participating in outdoor activities should seek sturdy
shelter until this storm passes. Open shelters found in parks,
beaches, or golf courses offer no protection from the dangers of
lightning.</instruction>
