<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM EDT
SATURDAY THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Warm air temperatures in the 70s may cause people to
underestimate the dangers of the cold water temperatures, which
are currently only in the upper 40s to mid 50s.
* WHERE...In Maine, Coastal York, Coastal Cumberland, Sagadahoc,
Lincoln, Knox and Coastal Waldo Counties. In New Hampshire,
Coastal Rockingham County.
* WHEN...From Saturday morning through Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...The cold water temperatures can quickly cause
hypothermia to anyone immersed in the water. According to the US
Coast Guard, when the water temperatures are below 50 degrees,
the chance of immediate incapacitation due to cold shock is
extremely high. Anyone on boats or paddlecraft should use
extreme caution to avoid this threat.</description>
<instruction>A Beach Hazards Statement is issued on days when a significant
number of boats and paddlecraft are expected to be out on the
water and when warm air temperatures may cause people to
underestimate the danger of the cold water. Paddle smart from the
start. Always wear your life jacket. Be aware of wind conditions,
tides, and localized currents.
All boaters and paddlers are highly encouraged to contact the
U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary or U.S. Power Squadrons at
www.wow.uscgaux/i_want_a_usc/index.php to receive a FREE vessel
check. This is a convenient, no consequence way to ensure your
vessel is outfitted with all required safety equipment.
Additionally, please label your paddlecraft with your contact
information (IF FOUND Sticker) in the event it is found adrift on
the water.</instruction>
