SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by snowmelt continues.
* WHERE...The Yukon and Porcupine River at Fort Yukon
* WHEN...Until 400 PM AKDT Saturday.
* IMPACTS...The runway remains cutoff from the terminal due to water
over the ramp and planes are unable to taxi to the terminal. High
water is impacting the road by the Voc-Ed building and flooding
portions of 4th, 6th, and 7th Ave. Several residences in low-lying
areas have flooded. There is also water around the north end of
the runway. The road east of the Tribal Hall has been breached to
reduce water levels and allow water to flow back towards the Yukon
River.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- As of 11:30 AM AKDT Friday, water levels are steady on the
Porcupine and are now dropping on the Upper Yukon at Dawson
and Eagle. Water levels are currently steady in Fort Yukon
but are expected to slowly recede over the weekend into the
next week.
