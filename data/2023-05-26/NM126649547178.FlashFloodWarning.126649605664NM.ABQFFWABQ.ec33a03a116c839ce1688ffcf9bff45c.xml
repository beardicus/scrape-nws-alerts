<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.
Arroyos, streams, and normally dry rivers can become raging killer
currents in a matter of minutes. Water in arroyos can travel many
miles and take hours to reach your location from upstream rain areas.
Excessive runoff from heavy rainfall will cause flooding of normally
dry arroyos and streambeds, low water crossings, intersections and
underpasses as well as other poor drainage and low lying areas.</instruction>
