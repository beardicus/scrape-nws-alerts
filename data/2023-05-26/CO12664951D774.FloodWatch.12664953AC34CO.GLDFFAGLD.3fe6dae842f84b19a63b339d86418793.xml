<headline>Flood Watch issued May 26 at 12:45AM MDT  by NWS Goodland</headline>
<description>.Multiple rounds of heavy rainfall over the past week has led to
saturated soil conditions across the area. A few locations in the
past 24 hours have seen several inches of rainfall; with the same
expected pattern continuing and the potential for greater than 2
inch per hour rainfall rates just a single cell would cause flash
flooding potential.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Colorado, northwest Kansas and southwest
Nebraska, including the following counties, in Colorado, Kit
Carson and Yuma. In northwest Kansas, Cheyenne, Decatur, Graham,
Norton, Rawlins, Sheridan, Sherman and Thomas. In southwest
Nebraska, Dundy, Hitchcock and Red Willow.
* WHEN...Through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Low-water
crossings may be flooded. Area creeks and streams are running high
and could flood with more heavy rain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The continued threat for high precipitation rates and slow
moving thunderstorm potential, in addition to recent rainfall
may further exacerbate any flooding concerns.
