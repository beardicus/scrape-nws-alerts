<description>...FLOOD WARNING FOR AN ICE JAM NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM AKDT
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues.
* WHERE...The Yukon River near Marshall to St. Mary`s, including the
village of Pilot Station
* WHEN...Until 400 PM AKDT Saturday.
* IMPACTS...An ice jam about 25 mi downstream of Russian Mission has
released and is likely to release water to communities downstream
of the jam. River levels are expected to continue to rise as
impounded high water behind these ice jams continues to push
downstream, likely leading to flooding down to St. Mary`s
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- As of 2:30 PM AKDT Friday, An ice jam upstream of Pilot
Station released Wednesday night causing water levels to rise
4 feet in Pilot Station with bank-to-bank tightly packed ice
and river levels approaching homes near the bank. Water
levels have also risen rapidly Wednesday night and yesterday
morning in Marshall and St. Mary`s. Water levels remain high.
Residents in these locations should be prepared for a long
period of high water even after the ice jams release.
