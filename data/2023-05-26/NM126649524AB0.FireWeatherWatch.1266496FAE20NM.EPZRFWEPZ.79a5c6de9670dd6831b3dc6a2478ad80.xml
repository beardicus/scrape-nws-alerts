<description>...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FOR SATURDAY AFTERNOON FOR GILA
NATIONAL FOREST AND BLACK RANGE...
.Dry, southwest flow will increase along western New Mexico on
Saturday as moisture remains confined to the east. Winds will
become breezy during the afternoon with 20-foot gusts up to
25 mph. This combined with very low relative humidity will create
dangerous fire conditions. Fuel conditions have dried quickly
since last week`s rains and are once again susceptible to fire
spread. Conditions will improve after sunset when temperatures
decrease and winds become light and terrain-driven.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING FOR STRONG WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE
HUMIDITY FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONE 110...
* AFFECTED AREA...Fire weather zone 110, including portions of
Grant, Catron, and Sierra Counties in southern New Mexico.
* WIND...Southwest at 15 to 25 mph.
* HUMIDITY...8 to 14 percent.
* IMPACTS...any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly.
Outdoor burning is not recommended.</description>
<instruction>A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
