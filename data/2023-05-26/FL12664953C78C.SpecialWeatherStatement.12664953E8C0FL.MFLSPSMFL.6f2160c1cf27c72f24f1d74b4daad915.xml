Waterway. Movement was northeast at 10 mph.
HAZARD...Landspouts, wind gusts of 50 to 55 mph, and pea size hail.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Minor damage to outdoor objects is possible. Gusty winds
could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured
objects.

Training Airport, Miles City and Deep Lake.

<instruction>Funnel clouds occasionally touch down and produce tornadoes or
waterspouts. Move indoors and stay away from windows.
Torrential rainfall is also occurring with these storms and may lead
to localized flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flooded
roadways.
Persons participating in outdoor activities should seek sturdy
shelter until these storms pass. Open shelters found in parks,
beaches, or golf courses offer no protection from the dangers of
lightning.</instruction>
