<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued January 11 at 3:04PM PST until January 13 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH
FRIDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Sneaker waves possible.
* WHERE...In Oregon, North Oregon Coast and Central Oregon
Coast. In Washington, South Washington Coast.
* WHEN...From late tonight through Friday morning.
* IMPACTS...Waves can run up significantly farther on a beach
than normal, including over rocks and jetties. Sneaker waves can
suddenly knock people off of their feet and quickly pull them
into the frigid ocean which may lead to serious injury or
drowning.</description>
<instruction>Remain out of the water to avoid hazardous swimming conditions.
A Beach Hazards Statement is issued when sneaker waves create
potentially life-threatening conditions in the surf zone. Caution
should be used when in or near the water.
Keep children and pets away from the surf zone. Keep off of
jetties, rocks and logs near the surf zone. If you see someone
swept into the sea do not swim in after them. Call 911 and keep an
eye on them until help arrives.</instruction>
