<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM NOON TUESDAY TO 8 PM
PDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 3 inches,

50 mph with 80 to 100 mph gusts along the Sierra crest.
* WHERE...Greater Lake Tahoe Area.
* WHEN...From noon Tuesday to 8 PM PDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous

strong winds could cause extensive tree damage.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow levels will crash on Tuesday with snow
expected for all elevations. There will be an initial band of
heavy snow pushing through Tuesday afternoon into the evening.
This will be followed by periods of snow showers Tuesday night
through Wednesday. These showers may bring rapidly changing
conditions with a quick 1 to 2 inches of accumulation possible.</description>
<instruction>Even light snowfall causes major travel delays, especially during
periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to
reach your destination. Leave extra space between vehicles since
it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
