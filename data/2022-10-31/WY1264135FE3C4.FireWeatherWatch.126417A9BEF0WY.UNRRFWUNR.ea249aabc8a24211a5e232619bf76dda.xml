<description>...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
WEDNESDAY EVENING FOR GUSTY WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR
NORTHEAST WYOMING AND MUCH OF WESTERN SOUTH DAKOTA...
.Increasing southwest winds ahead of a developing low pressure
system, coupled with very dry air and warm temperatures, will
likely support a long duration of critical fire weather conditions
over northeast WY and much of western SD Tuesday into Wednesday.
Gusty southwest winds will develop Tuesday afternoon and will
persist into Wednesday. The strongest winds are expected over
northeast WY into far western SD, where gusts over 50 mph will be
possible, especially Wednesday. Daytime RHâ€™s will fall into the
teens both days. Poor RH recovery is forecast Tuesday night,
supporting continued elevated to critical fire weather conditions
overnight. A cold front will then move into the region Wednesday
evening, with winds shifting northwest and RH`s increasing.
