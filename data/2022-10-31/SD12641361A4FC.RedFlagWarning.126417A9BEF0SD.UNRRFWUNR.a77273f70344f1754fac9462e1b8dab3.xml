<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM NOON TUESDAY TO 9 PM MDT
WEDNESDAY FOR GUSTY WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR FIRE
WEATHER ZONES 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323,
324, 325, 326, 327, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334, AND 335...
.Increasing south to southwest winds ahead of a developing low
pressure system will combine with very dry air and warm
temperatures Tuesday afternoon through early Wednesday evening.
Due to downslope flow in place, poor relative humidity recovery is
expected Tuesday night, especially on the eastern slopes of the
Black Hills. A strong cold front will move through Wednesday
night. Thus, expect a longer period of critical fire weather
conditions over northeast Wyoming and much of western South
Dakota Tuesday afternoon through early Wednesday evening.
The strongest winds are expected over northeast Wyoming into far
western SD, where gusts over 50 mph will be possible, especially
Wednesday. Daytime relative humidities will fall into the teens
both days. Relative humidity recovery Tuesday night will only be
in the 20s for the higher elevations with some 30s and 40s on the
plains.
A sharp cold front will move into the region Wednesday evening,
with winds shifting northwest, bringing increasing relative
humidities.
