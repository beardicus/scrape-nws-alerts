<headline>High Wind Warning issued April 12 at 9:24AM MDT until April 12 at 7:00PM MDT by NWS Goodland</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM MDT /8 PM CDT/ THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Southwest winds at 30 to 50 mph with gusts up to 65 mph,
shifting to the northwest during the afternoon.
* WHERE...Portions of northwest and west central Kansas and east
central Colorado. This includes the Interstate 70 corridor from
Flagler, Colorado to Quinter, Kansas.
* WHEN...Until 7 PM MDT /8 PM CDT/ this evening.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous travel conditions associated with strong
winds and blowing dust, especially on major routes such as
Interstate 70, Highway 83, and Highway 283. Wind of this
magnitude may also down trees, power lines, and damage
property.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Near the Colorado border, winds will shift
to the northwest by early afternoon. In northwest Kansas, the
northwesterly wind shift will occur during the mid to late
afternoon.</description>
<instruction>If you must drive, watch for objects blowing across the roadway
and into your path. Keep a safe distance from cars in adjacent
lanes as strong gusts could suddenly push a vehicle outside its
lane of travel. Take extra care in high-profile vehicles such as a
truck, van, or SUV, or when towing a trailer, as these are more
prone to be pushed or even flipped by high winds.
High dust concentrations can aggravate asthma and cause
respiratory problems, especially in children, the elderly, or
those with pre-existing respiratory conditions. The Kansas
Department of Health and Environment recommends taking
preventative measures such as staying indoors or wearing
protective breathing masks, if outside.</instruction>
