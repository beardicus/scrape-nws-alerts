<headline>Blizzard Warning issued April 12 at 3:43AM CDT until April 14 at 7:00PM CDT by NWS Eastern ND and Grand Forks</headline>
<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM THIS MORNING TO 7 PM CDT
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions expected across western Grand Forks
County. Total snow accumulations of 6 to 14 inches across
western Grand Forks County. 1 to 5 inches of accumulation is
expected across eastern Grand Forks County. Winds gusting as
high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...Grand Forks County.
* WHEN...From 10 AM this morning to 7 PM CDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Heavy
snowfall rates and blowing snow will reduce visibilities to a
quarter mile or less. Where heaviest snowfall occurs large
impassible drifts may severely impact travel and travel impacts
may linger after snow stops falling.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...There will be a sharp cutoff within Grand
Forks County where precipitation may remain rain through this
evening instead of snow greatly impacting potential
accumulations in the east.</description>
<instruction>Travel should be restricted to emergencies only. If you must
travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded,
stay with your vehicle.
The latest road conditions for North Dakota can be found at
dot.nd.gov/travel and for Minnesota at 511mn.org, or by calling
5 1 1 in either state.</instruction>
