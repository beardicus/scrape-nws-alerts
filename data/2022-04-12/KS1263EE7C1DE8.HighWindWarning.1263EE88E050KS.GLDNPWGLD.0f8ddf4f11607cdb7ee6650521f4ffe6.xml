<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM MDT /8 PM CDT/
THIS EVENING...
...BLOWING DUST ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM MDT /8 PM
CDT/ THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Southwest winds at 30 to 50 mph with gusts up to 65
mph, shifting to the northwest during the afternoon.
Visibility between one quarter mile and one mile in blowing
dust.
* WHERE...Cheyenne, Rawlins, Sherman, Thomas, and Wallace
Counties.
* WHEN...Until 7 PM MDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous driving conditions due to reduced
visibility. Damaging winds will blow down trees and power
lines. Widespread power outages are expected. Travel will be
difficult, especially for high profile vehicles.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Near the Colorado border, winds will
shift to the northwest by early afternoon. In northwest
Kansas, the northwesterly wind shift will occur during the mid
to late afternoon.</description>
<instruction>If you must drive, watch for objects blowing across the roadway
and into your path. Keep a safe distance from cars in adjacent
lanes as strong gusts could suddenly push a vehicle outside its
lane of travel. Take extra care in high-profile vehicles such as
a truck, van, or SUV, or when towing a trailer, as these are more
prone to be pushed or even flipped by high winds.
High dust concentrations can aggravate asthma and cause
respiratory problems, especially in children, the elderly, or
those with pre-existing respiratory conditions. The Kansas
Department of Health and Environment recommends taking
preventative measures such as staying indoors or wearing
protective breathing masks, if outside.</instruction>
