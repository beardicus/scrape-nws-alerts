<headline>Flood Watch issued April 12 at 2:58PM CDT until April 12 at 6:15PM CDT by NWS Duluth</headline>
<description>.Heavy rain on top of the existing snowpack may increase the rate of
snowmelt. The resultant runoff may cause water levels in area rivers
to increase and flooding is possible.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM CDT THIS EVENING THROUGH THURSDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and/or snowmelt and/or ice jam is
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of northwest Wisconsin, including the following
counties, Ashland, Bayfield and Iron.
* WHEN...From 7 PM CDT this evening through Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. Storm drains and ditches may
become clogged with debris. Extensive street flooding and flooding
of creeks and rivers are possible. Area creeks and streams are
running high and could flood with more heavy rain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Heavy rain on top of a melting snowpack may cause rapid
runoff which could cause area streams to swell quickly
causing flooding.

Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
