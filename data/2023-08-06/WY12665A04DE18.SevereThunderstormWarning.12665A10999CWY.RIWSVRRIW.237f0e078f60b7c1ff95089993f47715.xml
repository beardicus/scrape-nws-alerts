<instruction>This storm is producing large hail. SEEK SHELTER NOW inside a sturdy

Intense thunderstorm lines can produce brief tornadoes and widespread
significant wind damage. Although a tornado is not immediately
likely, it is best to move to an interior room on the lowest floor of
a building.
If on or near area lakes, get away from the water and move indoors
or inside a vehicle. If you can hear thunder, you are close enough
to be struck by lightning. Move to safe shelter now!</instruction>
