<description>...HEAVY RAIN AND GUSTY WINDS POSSIBLE WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...
A tropical system, known as Invest 94W, continues to be monitored
by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and your National
Weather Service Forecast Office in Guam. This system is forecast
to start to become better organized as we progress through Monday
and Tuesday as it lifts slowly north. Another circulation, known
as Invest 95W, is also expected to develop during this time well
to the north of the Marianas. Both systems will allow a southerly
to southwesterly monsoon flow to develop, helping bring deeper
tropical moisture northward through the region.
At this time, all numerical guidance indicates a strengthening and
elongating monsoonal flow will persist for the middle to end of
the week, perhaps longer. Model solutions also suggest that the
tropical circulation will continue to gradually strengthen as it
passes through, with heavy rainfall and gusty winds developing.
The potential is fairly high for locally heavy rainfall of 4 to 8
inches to develop, with locally higher amounts possible. Gusty
winds of 30 to 45 mph may also develop near any stronger shower
or thunderstorm that develops.</description>
