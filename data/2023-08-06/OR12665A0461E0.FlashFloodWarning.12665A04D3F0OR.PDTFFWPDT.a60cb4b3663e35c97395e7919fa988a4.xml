<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued August 06 at 1:08PM PDT until August 06 at 4:00PM PDT by NWS Pendleton</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Pendleton has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
Southern Wallowa County in northeastern Oregon...
* Until 400 PM PDT.
* At 108 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing
heavy rain across the warned area. Between 0.4 and 0.6 inches of
rain have fallen. Additional rainfall amounts of 0.5 to 1.5 inches
are possible in the warned area. Flash flooding is ongoing or
expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar may result in debris flow
moving through the Nebo Fire burn scar. The debris flow can consist
of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban
areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as
other poor drainage and low-lying areas.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
mainly rural areas of Southern Wallowa County including the Nebo
Fire burn scar.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
