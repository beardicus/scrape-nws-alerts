are starting to recede but flooding is expected to continue
for several more hours. Water levels are currently at 14.71

currently falling. Flooding is being reported in areas that

significant flooding to some homes in the area. Locations

- Inherent uncertainty in initial glacier lake volume will
result in varying crest height and timing.

be prepared to take action.
- The US Coast Guard recommends that mariners use caution when
transiting the affected area and be aware of significant debris in
the water.</description>
