        <headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued October 14 at 5:42PM EDT until October 16 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City NC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 6 to
9 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards Statement,
dangerous rip currents, large breaking waves, and strong
longshore currents in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood
Advisory, up to 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level
expected in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.

* WHERE...Hatteras Island.

* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT Wednesday.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, until 8 PM EDT this evening.
For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 8 PM EDT Thursday.

* IMPACTS...Up to 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in a low threat of property damage. Some roads and
low lying property including parking lots, parks, lawns, and
homes adjacent to the waterfront will experience shallow
flooding. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore
break can throw a swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom
causing neck and back injuries. Strong longshore currents will
create dangerous swimming conditions.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The combination of strong onshore winds,
high astronomical tides, wave run up, and already battered and
weakened dune and other oceanside structures will bring the
potential of additional impacts to Hatteras Island, mostly
north of Cape Hatteras, around the time of high tide through
Thursday. Additionally, minor soundside flooding is expected to
last through at least Wednesday.

        <instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.

Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.

Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.

Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.

Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
