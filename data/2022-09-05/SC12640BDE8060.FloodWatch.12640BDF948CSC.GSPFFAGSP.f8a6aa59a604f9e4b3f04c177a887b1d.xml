* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Persistent moist southerly flow continues to support heavy
rainfall along and near the southern facing ridges of the
Appalachians in Northeast Georgia, western Upstate South
Carolina, and western North Carolina. Prolonged rainfall or
repeated rounds of heavy rain may result in flash flooding,
especially in areas that saw heavy rainfall over the weekend.
The threat of heavy rain will continue into this evening,
although the threat may become more localized with time.

<instruction>Rainfall of more than five inches in similar storms has been
associated with an increased risk of landslides and rockslides. If
you live on a mountainside or in a cove at the base of a mountain,
especially near a stream, be ready to leave in advance of the storm
or as quickly as possible should rising water, moving earth, or
rocks threaten. Consider postponing travel along mountain roads
during periods of heavy rainfall.</instruction>
