<headline>Flood Watch issued September 05 at 3:24AM EDT  by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>.A frontal zone draped across the Northeast is combining with a very
humid airmass to produce a heavy rainfall threat across the region
today into Tuesday with multiple rounds of rain and embedded
thunderstorms. Training and slow movement of showers combined with
pockets of convectively enhanced rainfall rates may lead to flooding
in the Watch area.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Maine, including the following areas,
Androscoggin, Central Interior Cumberland, Coastal Cumberland,
Coastal York, Interior Cumberland Highlands, Interior York,
Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln, Sagadahoc and Southern Oxford. Portions
of northern New Hampshire, including the following areas, Northern
Carroll and Southern Carroll.
* WHEN...Through Tuesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Multiple rounds of slow-moving, and in some cases stationary,
rain showers today through tonight will lead to rainfall
totals of 1-2 inches on average, some of which will fall on
areas that have already picked up 1-2 inches of rain this
morning. There is potential for pockets of rainfall
accumulation in excess of 4 inches, especially near the
coast.
