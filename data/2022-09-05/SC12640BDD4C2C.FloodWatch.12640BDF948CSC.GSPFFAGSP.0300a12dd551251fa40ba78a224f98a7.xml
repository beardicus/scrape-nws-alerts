<headline>Flood Watch issued September 05 at 4:19AM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of North Carolina and upstate South Carolina,
including the following areas, in North Carolina, Alexander,
Avery, Buncombe, Burke Mountains, Caldwell Mountains, Eastern
McDowell, Eastern Polk, Greater Burke, Greater Caldwell, Greater
Rutherford, Madison, McDowell Mountains, Mitchell and Yancey. In
upstate South Carolina, Northern Spartanburg.
* WHEN...Through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Low-water
crossings may be flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A persistent southerly upslope flow of moisture will support
widespread showers and thunderstorms across the mountains and
foothills of North Carolina through today. If this continues
into the afternoon, eventually the threat for flash flooding
along creeks and streams will increase and warnings may
become necessary.

<instruction>Rainfall of more than five inches in similar storms has been
associated with an increased risk of landslides and rockslides. If
you live on a mountainside or in a cove at the base of a mountain,
especially near a stream, be ready to leave in advance of the storm
or as quickly as possible should rising water, moving earth, or
rocks threaten. Consider postponing travel along mountain roads
during periods of heavy rainfall.</instruction>
