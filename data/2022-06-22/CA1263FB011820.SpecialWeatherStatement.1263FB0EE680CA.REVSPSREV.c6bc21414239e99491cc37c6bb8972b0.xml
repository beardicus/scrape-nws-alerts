<description>...Thunderstorms Through the Weekend with Warming Temperatures...
Heat:
* A warming trend is underway this week, and while it will be hot,
it isn`t too unusual for mid-June. Highs will run about 5-10
degrees above normal with 90s in the lower valleys and 80s in
the Sierra valleys. The warmest days of the week look to be
Sunday and Monday.
* Most areas will see low-to-moderate heat risks for sensitive
populations. Strenuous activities should be reduced, eliminated,
or rescheduled to the coolest time of the day. Individuals at risk
should stay in the coolest available place. Make sure to drink
plenty of water to stay hydrated. Never leave children or animals
in a vehicle.
Thunderstorms:
* There is a 15-20% chance for storms in the Eastern Sierra late
this afternoon and into the evening. A few showers may linger
overnight with 15% chances for thunderstorms as well. Chances
will increase across all of the Sierra, northeast California,
and western Nevada Thursday. Isolated storms remain possible
into the weekend.
* Hazards with these thunderstorms will include lightning with new
fire starts possible, gusty/erratic winds, heavy rainfall with
an elevated risk for flash flooding and debris flows on recent
burn scars, small hail, and rapid temperature drops.
* Stay aware of weather conditions and have a way to get weather
alerts, especially if you are recreating outdoors. Take note of
vertically developing clouds, and end your activity early to
get indoors. If you hear thunder while you`re on the lake or
miles into a hike, then you`re already too late for taking
shelter. Stay away from recent burn scars as heavy rainfall can
create dangerous debris flows.
Breezes:
* Typical westerly breezes with speeds 20-30 mph kick back up
Wednesday through the weekend. Low relative humidity may create
localized critical fire weather conditions during this time
period.</description>
