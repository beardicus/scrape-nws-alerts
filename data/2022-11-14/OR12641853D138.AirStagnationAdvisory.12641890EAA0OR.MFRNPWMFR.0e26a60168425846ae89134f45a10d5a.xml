<headline>Air Stagnation Advisory issued November 14 at 9:58AM PST until November 18 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...FREEZING FOG ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 AM PST THIS
MORNING...
...AIR STAGNATION ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM THIS
EVENING TO 10 AM PST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Freezing Fog Advisory, visibility one quarter of
a mile or less in freezing fog. For the Air Stagnation Advisory,
stagnant air is expected, which may lead to deteriorating air
quality.
* WHERE...The sheltered valleys of Eastern Curry County and
Josephine County and Jackson County, including the cities of
Cave Junction, Obrien, Grants Pass, Rogue River and Medford.
* WHEN...For the Freezing Fog Advisory, until 11 AM PST this
morning. For the Air Stagnation Advisory, from 7 PM this
evening to 10 AM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous driving conditions due to low visibility
and potential frost on bridges. Air stagnation is likely to
result in diminishing air quality with time, especially in and
near areas with significant sources of air pollution.
Diminished air quality is likely to cause health issues for
people with respiratory problems if precautions are not taken.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Southeast winds will likely surface in
the south end of the Rogue Valley near Ashland Tuesday and
Wednesday, so air stagnation is less likely there.
* View the hazard area in detail at
https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/map/?wfo=mfr</description>
<instruction>* Slow down and give 3 times as much space as normal between
vehicles.
* Shaded areas may be more slippery than unshaded areas.
* Use low beams. High beams reflect back fog making visibility
worse for you and other drivers.
State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor
burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be
limited as much as possible. According to state air quality
agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants
close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with
your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
