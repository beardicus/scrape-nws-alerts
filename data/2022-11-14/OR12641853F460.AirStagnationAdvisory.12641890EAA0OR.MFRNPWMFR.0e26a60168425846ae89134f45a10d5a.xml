<headline>Air Stagnation Advisory issued November 14 at 10:48AM PST until November 18 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...AIR STAGNATION ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM THIS
EVENING TO 10 AM PST FRIDAY...
...FREEZING FOG ADVISORY WILL EXPIRE AT 11 AM PST THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Stagnant air is expected, which may lead to deteriorating
air quality. Areas of fog could lead to reduced visibility
until Noon PST.
* WHERE...The sheltered valleys of Eastern Curry County and
Josephine County and Jackson County, including the cities of
Cave Junction, Obrien, Grants Pass, Rogue River and Medford.
* WHEN...From 7 PM this evening to 10 AM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Air stagnation is likely to result in diminishing
air quality with time, especially in and near areas with
significant sources of air pollution. Diminished air quality
is likely to cause health issues for people with respiratory
problems if precautions are not taken.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Southeast winds will likely surface in the
south end of the Rogue Valley near Ashland through Wednesday,
so air stagnation is less likely there.

<instruction>People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with diminished air quality. N95 masks are
effective at filtering out the majority of harmful air
particulates.
State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor
burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be
limited as much as possible. According to state air quality
agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants
close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with
your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
