<description>...AIR STAGNATION ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM THIS
EVENING TO 10 AM PST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Stagnant air is expected, which may lead to
deteriorating air quality.
* WHERE...The sheltered valleys of Central Douglas County
including the cities of Roseburg.
* WHEN...From 7 PM this evening to 10 AM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Air stagnation is likely to result in diminishing
air quality with time, especially in and near areas with
significant sources of air pollution. Diminished air quality
is likely to cause health issues for people with respiratory
problems if precautions are not taken.

<instruction>People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with diminished air quality. N95 masks are
effective at filtering out the majority of harmful air
particulates.
State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor
burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be
limited as much as possible. According to state air quality
agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants
close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with
your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
