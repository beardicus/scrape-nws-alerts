<headline>Dense Fog Advisory issued November 14 at 8:16PM PST until November 15 at 9:00AM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...DENSE FOG ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM PST TUESDAY...
...AIR STAGNATION ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Dense Fog Advisory, visibility less than a
quarter of a mile are occuring in dense freezing fog. For the
Air Stagnation Advisory, stagnant air is expected, which may
lead to deteriorating air quality.
* WHERE...The valleys of Lake County, including Alkali lake,
Valley Falls, Lakeview, Paisley, Summer Lake, and Silver Lake,
and portions of highways 395, 31, and 20.
* WHEN...The Dense Fog Advisory is in effect until 9 AM PST
Tuesday. The Air Stagnation Advisory is in effect until 10 AM
PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Dense freezing fog will result in hazardous conditions
due to very low visibilities and slick road surfaces. Also, air
stagnation is likely to result in diminishing air quality with
time, especially in and near areas with significant sources of
air pollution. Diminished air quality is likely to cause health
issues for people with respiratory problems if precautions are
not taken.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A front will move through Thursday night,
which could bring some improvement to air conditions Friday.

<instruction>If driving, slow down, use your headlights, and leave plenty of
distance ahead of you.
People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with diminished air quality. N95 masks are
effective at filtering out the majority of harmful air
particulates.
State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor
burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be
limited as much as possible. According to state air quality
agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants
close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with
your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
