<headline>Red Flag Warning issued March 04 at 1:53PM MST until March 05 at 6:00PM MST by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>...DRY AND WINDY ON SUNDAY...
.Strong west to southwest winds and low humidity will create
enhanced fire weather conditions on Sunday. Over much of
northeastern Colorado, current or recent snow cover will limit
fire spread. However, areas south of Limon and the Denver-Boulder
area have drier grasses and will also have the stronger winds and
lower humidities so a Red Flag Warning has been issued for those
areas.
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM TO 6 PM MST SUNDAY FOR
WIND AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR BROOMFIELD AND THE LOWER
ELEVATIONS OF BOULDER AND JEFFERSON COUNTIES...FIRE WEATHER ZONE

<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
