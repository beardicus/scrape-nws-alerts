<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM AST SUNDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY
AFTERNOON...

to breaking waves up to 9 to 11 feet and occasionally higher.
Localized beach erosion is possible.
* WHERE...Beaches from northwest to northeast Puerto Rico,
Culebra and St. Croix.
* WHEN...High Surf Advisory through 6 AM AST Sunday. High Rip
Current Risk in effect through at least Sunday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming conditions. Rip currents can

waters. Hazardous breaking waves.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.
A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in
the advisory area, producing localized beach erosion and
dangerous swimming conditions.</instruction>
