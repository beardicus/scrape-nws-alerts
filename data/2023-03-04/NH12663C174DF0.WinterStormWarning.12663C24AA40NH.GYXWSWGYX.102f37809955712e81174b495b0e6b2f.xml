<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 04 at 7:44AM EST until March 04 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...SIGNIFICANT SNOWSTORM THROUGH TODAY...
.A winter storm tracking offshore of southern New England today will
bring a period of locally heavy snowfall rates to south-central New
Hampshire and southwestern Maine through this morning. Snowfall
rates will then temporarily decrease late this morning before
increasing again for a few hours this afternoon as low pressure
strengthens offshore. Wet snow may also fall along the coasts of
Maine and New Hampshire. Additionally, strong gusty winds along the
coastal plain and into the interior are expected. When combined with
wet snow, this may lead to power outages and when combined with
drier snow, would produce localized whiteout conditions.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Heavy snow. Additional snow accumulations between 4 and 6
inches for a storm total of 6 to 11 inches.
* WHERE...Portions of south central and western Maine. Portions of
northern New Hampshire.
* WHEN...Until 7 PM EST this evening.
* IMPACTS...A snowstorm will bring plowable snow to the region with
a period of moderate travel impacts expected. Periods of moderate
snow and low visibility will be the biggest hazards.</description>
