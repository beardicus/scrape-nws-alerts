<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 04 at 3:08AM EST until March 04 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...SIGNIFICANT SNOWSTORM THROUGH TODAY...
.A winter storm tracking offshore of southern New England today will
bring a period of locally heavy snowfall rates to south-central New
Hampshire and southwestern Maine through this morning. Snowfall
rates will then temporarily decrease late this morning before
increasing again for a few hours this afternoon as low pressure
strengthens offshore. Wet snow may also fall along the coasts of
Maine and New Hampshire. Additionally, strong gusty winds along the
coastal plain and into the interior are expected. When combined with
wet snow, this may lead to power outages and when combined with
drier snow, would produce localized whiteout conditions.
...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 5 and
7 inches.
* WHERE...Southern Somerset County.
* WHEN...Until 7 PM EST this evening.
* IMPACTS...A weather system will bring a period of snowfall to the
region. Although snowfall amounts will be light to moderate,
travel will still be impacted due to snowfall accumulations on
roads.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road conditions can
be obtained by going to newengland511.org</instruction>
