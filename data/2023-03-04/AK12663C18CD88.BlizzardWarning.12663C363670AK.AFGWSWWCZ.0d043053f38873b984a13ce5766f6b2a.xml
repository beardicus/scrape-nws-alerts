an inch. Winds gusting as high as 65 mph.
* WHERE...Southern Seward Peninsula Coast.
* WHEN...From 6 PM this evening to 6 AM AKST Monday.

strong winds could cause extensive damage to power lines. The
cold wind chills as low as 30 below zero could cause frostbite

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A series of weather fronts will produce
periods of snow through the weekend and into Monday.</description>

expected or occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds
and poor visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout
conditions, making travel extremely difficult.</instruction>
