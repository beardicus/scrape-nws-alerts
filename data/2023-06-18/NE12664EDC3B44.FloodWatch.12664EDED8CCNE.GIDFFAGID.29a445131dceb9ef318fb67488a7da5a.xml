<senderName>NWS Hastings (North Central Kansas and South Central Nebraska)</senderName>
<headline>Flood Watch issued June 18 at 9:01PM CDT until further notice by NWS Hastings</headline>
<description>...The Flood Watch continues for the following rivers in Nebraska...
Platte River Near Darr affecting Dawson County.
...FLOOD WATCH NOW IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY AFTERNOON UNTIL FURTHER
NOTICE...
* WHAT...Minor Flooding is possible.
* WHERE...Platte River near Darr, with this Watch valid for the
stretch of the river from the Dawson-Lincoln County line
downstream to near Lexington.
* WHEN...From Tuesday afternoon until further notice.
* IMPACTS...At 10.0 feet, Flooding of the low lying land right along
the river can be expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 8:00 PM CDT Sunday the stage was 9.4 feet, and was very
slowly rising.
- Forecast...Due to significant recent precipitation upstream
along the South Platte River, particularly in Colorado,
elevated water levels are gradually working eastward along
the Platte River in Nebraska. If current forecasts remain on
track, the gauge near Darr could reach minor flood stage of
10.0 feet on Tuesday afternoon, and then perhaps continue
rising to a crest around 10.7 feet on Thursday before slowly
falling. Please note that there is still some uncertainty
with this river forecast, but if later forecasts continue to
support a likelihood of minor flooding, then this Watch will
likely be upgraded to a Warning at some point during the next
24 to 36 hours.
- Flood stage is 10.0 feet.
