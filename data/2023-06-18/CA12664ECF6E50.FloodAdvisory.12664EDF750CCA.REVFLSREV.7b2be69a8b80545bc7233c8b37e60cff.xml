<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded mountain roads.
Most flood deaths occur in vehicles. Be especially cautious at night
when it is harder to recognize the dangers of flooding.
It is important to know where you are relative to streams, rivers,
or creeks which can flow over their banks. Campers and hikers should
avoid streams or creeks, which can become dangerous to cross due to
fast and cold flows.</instruction>
