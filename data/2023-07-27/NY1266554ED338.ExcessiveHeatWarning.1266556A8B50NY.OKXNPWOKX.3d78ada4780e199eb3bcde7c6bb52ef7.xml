<instruction>New York City residents should call 3 1 1 to identify cooling
center locations and obtain `Beat the Heat` safety tips.
An Excessive Heat Warning is issued when the combination of heat
and humidity is expected to make it feel like it is 105 degrees
or greater. Take extra precautions if you work or spend time
outside. When possible, reschedule strenuous activities to early
morning or evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat
exhaustion and heat stroke. Wear light weight and loose fitting
clothing when possible, and drink plenty of water.
Seniors and those with chronic health problems or mental health
conditions are at increased risk. Homes without air conditioning
can be much hotter than outdoors.
Use air conditioning to stay cool at home or go to a place that
has air conditioning. Check on vulnerable friends, family members
and neighbors.
To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent rest breaks
in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone overcome by
heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location. Heat stroke
is an emergency! In cases of heat stroke call 9 1 1.</instruction>
