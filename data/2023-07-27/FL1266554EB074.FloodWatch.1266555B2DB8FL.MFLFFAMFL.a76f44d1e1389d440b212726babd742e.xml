<headline>Flood Watch issued July 27 at 2:45PM EDT until July 27 at 8:30PM EDT by NWS Miami</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of southeast Florida, including the following
areas, Coastal Broward County, Coastal Miami Dade County, Coastal
Palm Beach County, Far South Miami-Dade County, Inland Miami-Dade
County, Metro Broward County, Metro Palm Beach County and
Metropolitan Miami Dade.
* WHEN...Through Friday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Extensive
street flooding and flooding of creeks and rivers are possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The rainfall from the showers and thunderstorms that have
been occurring over the eastern areas of South Florida the
last several days has lead to the grounds becoming saturated.
Heavy downpours from showers and thunderstorms could produce
up to an additional 1-3 inches of rainfall through Friday
morning with localized amounts up to 4 inches with the
stronger showers and thunderstorms. The potential for
additional heavy rainfall during this time frame will
continue to create flooding concerns especially over areas
that have seen heavy downpours over the past couple of days.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
