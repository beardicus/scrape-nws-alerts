<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM THIS MORNING TO 4 AM
CDT FRIDAY...
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM FRIDAY TO 1 AM CDT
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 5 to 9
inches, with locally higher amounts possible. Winds gusting as
high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...Ramsey and Nelson Counties.
* WHEN...For the Winter Storm Warning, from 9 AM this morning to
4 AM CDT Friday. For the Winter Weather Advisory, from 4 AM
Friday to 1 AM CDT Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Significantly reduced visibility from heavy snow rates
and accumulating snow will make travel very difficult. The
hazardous conditions will impact the Thursday and Friday
commutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...With ongoing flooding and water filled
ditches, it is possible vehicles may slide off the road into
very cold water. There remains a notable degree of uncertainty
in snow amounts and associated impacts.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, slow down, don`t use cruise control, and use
extra caution while traveling.
Due to the wet and heavy nature of expected snow, take frequent
breaks when shoveling snow.
The latest road conditions for North Dakota can be found at
travel.dot.nd.gov and for Minnesota at 511mn.org, or by calling
5 1 1 in either state.</instruction>
