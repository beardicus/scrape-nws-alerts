<description>...Warm Temperatures Through Friday Afternoon Followed By Sharp
Cooling over the Weekend...
Strong high pressure over the Interior is causing mostly sunny
skies and warmer temperatures today, that will continue into
Friday. Highs will be in the upper 30s to upper 40s today, and
near 40 on Friday. Lows will be in the teens and 20s.
A strong cold front north of the Arctic Coast today will move
south over the Northeast Eastern Interior Friday afternoon, and
then south across the Eastern Interior Friday night. This will
bring much colder temperatures with highs only in the 20s this
weekend, along with strong winds and snow. The cold temperatures
will continue into early next week.
Expect northeast winds gusting to 30 mph to spread over the
Interior Friday night and Saturday, with winds likely lasting into
Monday. Stronger gusts to 40 mph reduced visibility in blowing
snow will develop through the Brooks Range Passes starting Friday
afternoon, and over the Interior Highway Summits of the Steese
and Elliott Highways starting late Friday night, with the blowing
snow continuing into Sunday night.
This front will bring a chance of snow to the Eastern Interior
from Friday afternoon through Sun, with snow likely over most
areas from Fairbanks south and east from Friday evening through
Saturday night. Between 1 and 4 inches of snow possible, heaviest
along north slopes of the White Mountains and along the Alaska
Range. There could additional 2 to 4 inches of snow Saturday
night and Sunday over the Interior southeast of Delta Junction.
Fairbanks can expect about 1 inch of snow Friday night and
Saturday. Fairbanks can also expected winds to gust to 30 mph
after midnight Friday night through Sunday, and possibly into
Monday.</description>
