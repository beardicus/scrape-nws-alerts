* WHAT...Flooding impacts caused by rain and snowmelt continue. High
water conditions persist.
* WHERE...All of northeast Minnesota and northwest Wisconsin.
* WHEN...Until 500 PM CDT Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 252 PM CDT, gauge reports indicated rivers remain very
high due to rain and snowmelt.  Minor flooding is occurring
in the advisory area where impacts from previous flooding
remain.  Expect steady to falling river levels across the
northern tier of Minnesota.  Additional rainfall of 0.2 to
0.3 inches, along with the previous up to 1.0 inches of
rainfall observed through Thursday afternoon, and snowmelt
will cause additional flooding for northwest Wisconsin and
areas of northeast Minnesota that drain into the St. Croix
River.
- Additional liquid equivalent, combining both melted snow and
rain, precipitation amounts of 0.2 to 0.8 inches are expected
over the area through Friday. This additional rain will
result in minor flooding and further rises in river levels.
