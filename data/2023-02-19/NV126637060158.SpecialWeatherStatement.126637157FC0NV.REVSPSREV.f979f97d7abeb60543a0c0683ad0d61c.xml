<description>...COLD, WIND, AND SNOW RETURN STARTING TUESDAY...
The holiday weekend will continue to be dry and mild before a
cold front ushers in a major change starting Tuesday.
* WINDS: Strong winds will accompany a cold front on Tuesday. Wind
gusts of 40-50 mph are expected along the front, with possible
stronger gusts surpassing 60 mph in wind prone areas along
US-395 as well as US-95 south of Highway 50. Wind gusts
exceeding 100 mph are expected along the Sierra crest. This will
bring impacts for both air and ground travel, along with choppy
lakes. Areas of blowing dust are also possible across the west
central Nevada Basin and Range, which could affect I-80, US-95,
and Highway 50 on Tuesday.
* SNOW: An initial round of snow is expected Tuesday and Tuesday
night, with a short burst of higher snowfall rates and even a
rumble of thunder possible with the front. Additional periods of
snow showers will follow through Thursday night. Overall snow
totals over the 3-day period could reach 12-18 inches along the
Sierra crest, with a dusting up to 2 inches into the valleys of
western Nevada.
* COLD TEMPERATURES: High temperatures Wednesday through Friday
will struggle to get out of the 30s in even the warmest valleys,
with teens and 20s in the mountains. Overnight lows will dip in
the teens and single digits, with below zero in colder valleys.
Brisk winds will make it feel even colder, with dangerous wind
chills in exposed areas of the high Sierra dipping as low as -30
degrees. Be sure to protect vulnerable populations as well as
pets.</description>
