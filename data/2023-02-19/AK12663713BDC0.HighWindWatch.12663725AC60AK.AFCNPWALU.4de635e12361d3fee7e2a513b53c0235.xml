<description>...HIGH WIND WATCH IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY EVENING THROUGH TUESDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Southwest winds 40 to 55 mph with gusts up to 75 mph
possible.
* WHERE...Central Aleutians.
* WHEN...From Monday evening through Tuesday morning.
* IMPACTS...High winds could move loose debris, damage property,
and cause power outages. Travel could be difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A strong low pressure system is expected to
lift out of the North Pacific and into the western Bering on
Monday. The leading frontal boundary will bring increasing
southerly winds and heavy precipitation Monday afternoon.
Stronger winds are expected Monday night through early Tuesday
morning as the wind direction shifts to the west-southwest.
Precipitation will initially start as wet snow Monday morning
before quickly changing to rain in the afternoon. Conditions are
expected to improve by Tuesday afternoon as the low lifts
northward.</description>
<instruction>A high wind watch means there is potential for a hazardous high
wind event. Monitor the latest forecasts and warnings for updates
on this situation. Fasten loose objects or shelter objects in a
safe location prior to the onset of winds.</instruction>
