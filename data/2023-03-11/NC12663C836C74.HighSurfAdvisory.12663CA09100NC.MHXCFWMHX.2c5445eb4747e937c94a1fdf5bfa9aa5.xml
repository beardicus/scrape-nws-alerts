<headline>High Surf Advisory issued March 11 at 4:01PM EST until March 13 at 7:00AM EST by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM EDT MONDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM THIS EVENING TO
MIDNIGHT EST TONIGHT...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 7 to
11 feet in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to
1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level expected in low-
lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...Oceanside areas from Cape Hatteras north.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 AM EDT Monday. For
the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 9 PM this evening to midnight
EST tonight.
* IMPACTS...Minor oceanside flooding and localized minor ocean
overwash possible late tonight into Monday morning due to wave
run up from low pressure offshore. Up to 1 to 2 feet of
inundation above ground level is possible in low-lying areas
near shorelines and tidal waterways resulting in a low threat of
property damage. Some roads and low lying property including
parking lots, parks, lawns, and homes adjacent to the waterfront
may experience shallow flooding. Dangerous swimming and surfing
conditions and localized beach erosion are also possible. The
areas most vulnerable will be oceanside locations north of Cape
Hatteras where dune structures are vulnerable, mainly around
times of high tide. High tide is around 10 PM tonight.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.</instruction>
