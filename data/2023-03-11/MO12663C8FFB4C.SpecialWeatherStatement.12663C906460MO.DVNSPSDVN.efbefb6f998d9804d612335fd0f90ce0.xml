<description>...Snow Continues to Move Across the Area...
Snow will continue to move eastward across the area through late
evening. The snow will be moderate to briefly heavy, as well as
mixed with rain at times. The snow will lead to reduced
visibilities down to a mile, and slippery travel conditions
especially on bridges and overpasses. In areas of lighter snow and
rain, the pavement should stay mainly wet. Additional snowfall
accumulations of up to 1 inch will be possible through midnight.
After the snow decreases later tonight, areas of fog may form and
linger into early Sunday morning. Some of this fog may become
dense, reducing visibility down to a quarter mile or less.
Use caution and utilize winter driving skills if traveling
tonight. Please drive slowly and allow extra time to reach your
destination.</description>
