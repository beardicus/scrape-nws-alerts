        <description>* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to 1 to 3 feet of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways. For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous
rip currents, large breaking waves expected, and strong
longshore currents in the surf zone. For the High Surf Advisory,
large breaking waves of 7 to 11 feet expected in the surf zone.
For the Coastal Flood Warning, up to 2 to 4 feet of inundation
above ground level expected in low- lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways.

* IMPACTS...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to 1 to 3 feet of
inundation above ground level with minor ocean overwash possible
in vulnerable locations along shorelines and tidal waterways.
For the Coastal Flood Warning, up to 2 to 4 feet of inundation
above ground level is possible in some areas near shorelines and
tidal waterways resulting in an elevated threat of property
damage around the times of high tide. Flooding will extend
inland from the waterfront threatening some homes and
businesses. Road closures and flooding of vehicles will be
possible, most notably along NC 12 where ocean overwash may make
several portions of the highway inaccessible across Ocracoke

life-threatening swimming and surfing conditions.

A Beach Hazards Statement is issued when threats such as rip
currents, longshore currents, and other hazards create
life-threatening conditions in the surf zone. Caution should be
used when in or near the water.</instruction>
