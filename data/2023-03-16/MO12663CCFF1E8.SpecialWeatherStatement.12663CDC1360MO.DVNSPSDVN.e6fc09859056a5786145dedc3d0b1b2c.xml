<description>...Strong Winds with Rain changing to Snow This Evening...
Northwest winds will increase this evening in the wake of a cold
frontal passage. Winds will become sustained near 30 mph and gust
up to 45 mph at times. This will make for difficult travel for
high profile vehicles, especially on north...south roadways.
In addition, the northwest winds will usher in much colder air and
this will cause the rain to change over to a period of sleet and
snow as the evening progresses. Visibilities in the snow could be
reduced to a mile or less due to the gusty winds. Accumulations
look to be under an inch and mainly on grassy and elevated
surfaces, but some slick spots could develop on bridges and
overpasses as temperatures drop to near the freezing mark by mid
to late evening.
Be alert for these changing conditions if traveling this evening.</description>
