<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 16 at 5:58AM AKDT until March 17 at 10:00AM AKDT by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...SNOW FOLLOWED BY HEAVY RAIN FOR SOUTHEAST ALASKA...
.Snow continues to fall over the northern Panhandle this morning.
Heavy snow over the far northern Panhandle will last well into
Thursday, especially at higher elevations and along the Klondike
and Haines Highways.
For those along the Icy Strait corridor, temperatures have warmed
enough through the evening and overnight for the transition to all
rain to occur.
For Yakutat, the main plume of moisture will shift to the west
with significant snow accumulations expected Friday afternoon
into Friday night. There is still a bit of uncertainty as to
where the heaviest plume of moisture will track and whether
surface temperatures will remain cold enough for significant
accumulations.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM THIS EVENING
TO 10 AM AKDT FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 4 to 8
inches. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...City and Borough of Yakutat.
* WHEN...From 6 PM Thursday to 10 AM AKDT Friday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Gusty winds could
bring down tree branches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Moderate snow will fall through Thursday
afternoon with heavy snow starting Thursday evening into Friday
morning. The main plume of moisture will shift to the west with
significant snow accumulations expected Friday afternoon into
Friday night. There is still a bit of uncertainty as to where
the heaviest plume of moisture will track and whether surface
temperatures will remain cold enough for significant
accumulations.</description>
