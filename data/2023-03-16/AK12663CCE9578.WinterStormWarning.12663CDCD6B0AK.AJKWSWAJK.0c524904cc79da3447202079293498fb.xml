<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 16 at 5:58AM AKDT until March 16 at 11:00PM AKDT by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...SNOW FOLLOWED BY HEAVY RAIN FOR SOUTHEAST ALASKA...
.Snow continues to fall over the northern Panhandle this morning.
Heavy snow over the far northern Panhandle will last well into
Thursday, especially at higher elevations and along the Klondike
and Haines Highways.
For those along the Icy Strait corridor, temperatures have warmed
enough through the evening and overnight for the transition to all
rain to occur.
For Yakutat, the main plume of moisture will shift to the west
with significant snow accumulations expected Friday afternoon
into Friday night. There is still a bit of uncertainty as to
where the heaviest plume of moisture will track and whether
surface temperatures will remain cold enough for significant
accumulations.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM AKDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Heavy snow. Additional snow accumulations of 6 to 17
inches, with the heaviest snow along the highways. Winds
gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Municipality of Skagway and Haines Borough and Klukwan.
* WHEN...Until 11 PM AKDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A transition to rain near sea level is
expected late Thursday morning with heavy snow continuing at
higher elevations through Thursday night.</description>
