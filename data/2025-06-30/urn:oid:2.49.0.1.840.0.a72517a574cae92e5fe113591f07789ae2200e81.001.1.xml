        <headline>Flood Warning issued June 30 at 7:01AM CDT until July 1 at 7:33AM CDT by NWS Midland/Odessa TX</headline>
        <description>...The National Weather Service in Midland/Odessa TX has issued a
Flood Warning for the following rivers in Texas...

Rio Grande at Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch near Castolon, Texas
affecting Brewster County.

For the Rio Grande...including Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch near
Castolon,  Texas...Moderate flooding is forecast.

* WHAT...Minor flooding is occurring and moderate flooding is
forecast.

* WHERE...Rio Grande at Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch near Castolon,
Texas.

* WHEN...From this morning to tomorrow morning.

* IMPACTS...At 12.0 feet (3.7 meters), the river reaches bankfull,
minor lowland flooding occurs, and no significant damage is
expected.
At 15.0 feet (4.6 meters), flood stage is reached.  Moderate
lowland flooding begins.  Roads that lead to Cottonwood Campground
and River Road may flood.  Stages are practically synonymous with
the gage at Cottonwood Campground at Castolon (CSTT2), and
therefore represent the reach from Santa Elena Canyon through
Cottonwood Campground, where damage may occur.  Cattle also graze
in the lowlands, and may be threatened.
At 19.0 feet (5.8 meters), the river reaches major flood stage.
Flooding begins to occur upstream in Cottonwood Campground at
Castolon, as stages at each location are practically synonymous.
Moderate lowland flooding begins at the gage site, but no damage
occurs.  The gage is inaccessible, as River Road is impassable at
several locations.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 6:15 AM CDT Monday the stage was 16.9 feet (5.2 meters).
- Bankfull stage is 12.0 feet (3.7 meters).

ending at 6:15 AM CDT Monday was 16.9 feet (5.2 meters).

feet (5.2 meters) this afternoon. It will then fall below
flood stage this evening.
