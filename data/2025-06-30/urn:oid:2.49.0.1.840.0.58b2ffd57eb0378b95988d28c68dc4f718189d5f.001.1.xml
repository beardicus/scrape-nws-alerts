        <headline>Flood Warning issued June 30 at 8:10AM CDT until July 1 at 4:14AM CDT by NWS Midland/Odessa TX</headline>
        <description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in Texas...

Rio Grande at Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch near Castolon, Texas
affecting Brewster County.

For the Rio Grande...including Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch near
Castolon,  Texas, Rio Grande at Rio Grande Village,  BBNP,  Texas...
Moderate flooding is forecast.

* WHAT...Moderate flooding is occurring and moderate flooding is
forecast.

* WHERE...Rio Grande at Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch near Castolon,
Texas.

* WHEN...Until late tonight.

* IMPACTS...At 12.0 feet (3.7 meters), the river reaches bankfull,
minor lowland flooding occurs, and no significant damage is
expected.
At 15.0 feet (4.6 meters), flood stage is reached.  Moderate
lowland flooding begins.  Roads that lead to Cottonwood Campground
and River Road may flood.  Stages are practically synonymous with
the gage at Cottonwood Campground at Castolon (CSTT2), and
therefore represent the reach from Santa Elena Canyon through
Cottonwood Campground, where damage may occur.  Cattle also graze
in the lowlands, and may be threatened.
At 19.0 feet (5.8 meters), the river reaches major flood stage.
Flooding begins to occur upstream in Cottonwood Campground at
Castolon, as stages at each location are practically synonymous.
Moderate lowland flooding begins at the gage site, but no damage
occurs.  The gage is inaccessible, as River Road is impassable at
several locations.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 7:15 AM CDT Monday the stage was 17.2 feet (5.2 meters).
- Bankfull stage is 12.0 feet (3.7 meters).
- Recent Activity...The maximum river stage in the 24 hours
ending at 7:15 AM CDT Monday was 17.2 feet (5.2 meters).
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise to a crest of 17.7
feet (5.4 meters) late this morning. It will then fall below
flood stage late this afternoon.
- Flood stage is 15.0 feet (4.6 meters).
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
18.5 feet (5.6 meters) on 09/03/2024.
