        <headline>Blowing Dust Advisory issued June 30 at 8:28AM MST until June 30 at 10:00PM MST by NWS Tucson AZ</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...Dangerously hot conditions with temperatures 108 to 112 in
the Gila River Valley. Isolated thunderstorms with strong
thunderstorm outflow wind gusts to 45-50 mph will result in
blowing dust lowering visibility between one-quarter and one mile
at times. The threat for blowing dust will persist into the
evening as stronger sustained east-to-southeast winds 20-30 mph
move into the area from the east.

* WHERE...Upper Gila River Valley.

* WHEN...For the Extreme Heat Warning, until 8 PM MST this evening.
For the Blowing Dust Advisory, from 1 PM this afternoon to 10 PM
MST this evening.

* IMPACTS...Heat related illnesses increase significantly during
extreme heat events. Blowing dust can restrict visibilities below
a mile posing a significant hazard to motorists. In addition,
strong and gusty winds will likely suspend dust into the air that
people and animals breathe. Individuals with heart disease and
respiratory sensitivities may want to reduce their level of
exertion to limit the dust they breathe into their lungs,
especially if they are near dust prone locations. Those most at
risk may feel better if they avoid outside exercise today, keeping
windows and doors closed to help reduce exposure.
</description>
        <instruction>Persons with respiratory problems should make preparations to stay
indoors until the storm passes. Be ready for a sudden drop in
visibility to near zero. If you encounter blowing dust or blowing
sand on the roadway or see it approaching, pull off the road as far
as possible and put your vehicle in park. Turn the lights all the
way off and keep foot off the brake pedal. Remember, 'Pull Aside,
Stay Alive'.

To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent rest breaks in
shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone overcome by heat
should be moved to a cool and shaded location. Heat stroke is an
emergency! Call 9 1 1.

Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible, reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when possible
and drink plenty of water.</instruction>
