be overwhelmed and holdover fires are possible. Thunderstorms are
expected to start dry, and progressively become wetter.

In Northern CA Fire Zone....285. This includes Modoc county.
In South Central OR Fire Zones...624...625. This includes Klamath
and Lake counties.
* Wind: West 5 to 10 mph with stronger and variable winds possible

Precautionary/preparedness actions...
If you have not packed your evacuation kit yet, now is the time to
do so. This includes items like important documents and essentials
you cannot live without. Fill your vehicle`s fuel tank. Visit
ready.gov/kit for more information.
Plan now to avoid using equipment that could cause sparks during
the period when critical weather conditions are possible. Visit
weather.gov/medford/wildfire for links to fire restrictions in
your area.
A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are possible during the valid watch time. These conditions could
promote the rapid spread of wildfires which could become life-
threatening. Check weather.gov/medford for forecast updates and a
possible upgrade of the this watch to a Red Flag Warning.
