<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued August 14 at 3:33PM MDT until August 14 at 5:30PM MDT by NWS El Paso</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in El Paso Tx/Santa Teresa has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
The Black Fire Burn Scar in...
Northeastern Grant County in southwestern New Mexico...
* Until 530 PM MDT.
* At 333 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing
heavy rain over the Black Fire Burn Scar. Between 0.5 and 0.8
inches of rain have fallen. Additional rainfall amounts of 0.25 to
1 inch are possible in the warned area. Flash flooding is ongoing
or expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through Black Canyon. The debris flow can consist of rock,
mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms in and around
the Black Fire Burn Scar.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flooding of areas in and around the Black Fire Burn
Scar.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
mainly rural areas of Northeastern Grant County
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>This is a life threatening situation. Heavy rainfall will cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks...streams...and
ditches in the Black Fire Burn Scar. Severe debris flows can also be
anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may be washed away in
places. If you encounter flood waters...climb to safety.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.</instruction>
