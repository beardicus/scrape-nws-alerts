* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1253 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms. This will cause small stream flooding. Up to
0.5 inches of rain have fallen.
- Hoyt Creek is the most likely place to experience minor

- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Excessive runoff from heavy rainfall will cause flooding of small
creeks and streams, country roads, farmland, and other low lying
spots.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.</instruction>
