<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 14 at 5:00PM MST until August 14 at 8:15PM MST by NWS Tucson</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM MST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Small stream flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
expected.
* WHERE...A portion of South Central Arizona, including the
following county, Pima.
* WHEN...Until 800 PM MST.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas...
especially along and near the San Luis Wash, San Simon Wash and
Vamori Wash.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 454 PM MST, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain has fallen
across portions of the Tohono O`odham Nation due to
thunderstorms this afternoon. This will cause small stream
flooding. Rainfall runoff will quickly drain into the San
Luis and San Simon washes. The combination of this runoff
along with a heavy flow already in the Vamori Wash will
result in small stream flooding problems, especially near the
village of Santa Cruz where the Vamori and San Simon washes
converge.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Pisinemo, Covered Wells, No:ligk, San Luis - Sells District,
Santa Cruz, Mountain Village and Kupk.
