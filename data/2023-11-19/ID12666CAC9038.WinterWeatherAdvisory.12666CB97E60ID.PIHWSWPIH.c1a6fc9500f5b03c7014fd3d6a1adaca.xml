<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM MST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Snow. As rain continues to transition to snow as colder
air works in behind a cold front, confidence continues to
increase regarding accumulating snowfall in the valleys with
moderate to at times heavy snow possible. Lower elevation
snowfall amounts are expected to be highest around Pocatello and
Bannock County including further south and east into the
Southeast Highlands where around 1 to 3 inches of snow is
possible with locally higher totals on the benches.
* WHERE...In and around Pocatello and surrounding higher terrain.
Locations like Blackfoot, Shelley and Fort Hall may see little
to no accumulations. Higher accumulations may be very localized
over the next few hours.
* WHEN...Until 11 PM MST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Motorists should plan ahead for winter
travel conditions and allow for extra time to reach their
destination.</description>
