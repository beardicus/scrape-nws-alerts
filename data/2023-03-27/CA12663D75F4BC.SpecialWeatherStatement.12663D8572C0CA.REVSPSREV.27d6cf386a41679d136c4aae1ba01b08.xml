<description>...COLD WITH ANOTHER IMPACTFUL STORM TONIGHT THROUGH MIDWEEK...
* A late winter storm will impact eastern California and western
Nevada late tonight through Wednesday, with the best chances for
heavy Sierra snowfall from Tuesday morning through late Tuesday
evening. Consider completing any travel to or from the Sierra
communities by this evening, or wait until Thursday when drier
conditions return.
* Gusty south to southwest winds will precede and accompany the
main cold front on Tuesday. Widespread wind gusts of 35 to 45
mph in valley locations with a few gusts above 50 mph in wind
prone areas will likely bring difficulties for high profile
vehicles, aviation and boating activities.
* For lower elevations of western Nevada and northeast California,
a cold rain or a rain-snow mix is expected to occur along a
cold front passage during the day Tuesday. As colder air spreads
in, snow levels will drop to near 4000-4500 feet with a short
changeover to all snow possible before ending. Accumulations
will generally be 2 inches or less, but higher amounts are
possible in the foothills. The late March sun angle will limit
accumulations on most road surfaces in lower elevations.
* For Tuesday night, a band of snow or a rain-snow mix could
produce accumulating snowfall and slick travel conditions across
I-80 in northern Pershing County, and US-50 well east of Fallon
to New Pass Summit. Elsewhere in western Nevada, roads that
start out wet Tuesday evening could develop icy patches
overnight especially on bridges or overpasses as temperatures
drop below freezing.</description>
