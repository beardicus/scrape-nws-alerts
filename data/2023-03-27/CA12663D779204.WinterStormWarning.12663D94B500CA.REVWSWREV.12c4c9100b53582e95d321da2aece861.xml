5 AM PDT WEDNESDAY...
* CHANGES...Slightly increased snow amounts near Mammoth Lakes and
June Lakes.
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 2 to 4
feet along the Sierra crest with 1 to 2 feet in Mammoth Lakes,
June Lakes and across higher passes of Highway 395. Elsewhere,
total accumulations of 3 to 8 inches are likely. Winds could

and above 80 mph along Sierra ridges.
* WHERE...Mono County.
* WHEN...From 8 AM Tuesday to 5 AM PDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be very difficult to impossible. Strong
winds will likely create whiteout conditions and considerable
drifting of snow.

Wednesday morning. However, snow showers are expected to develop
late in the morning through the afternoon with additional
accumulations expected. Prepare for travel impacts to persist.
Latest projections indicate overall additional accumulations
will be 1 to 4 inches, although heavier snow showers could
produce a bit higher amounts. Winds will be much lighter for
Wednesday.</description>
