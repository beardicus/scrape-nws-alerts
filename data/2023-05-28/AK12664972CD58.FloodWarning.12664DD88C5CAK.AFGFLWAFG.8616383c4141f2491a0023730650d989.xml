- At 239 PM AKDT, An ice jam downriver from Mountain Village at
Middle Mouth and South Mouth confluence is backing up water
and ice past 10 Mile Island. This ice jam is forcing water
and ice into the Middle Mouth where another ice jam is in
place.
Extensive overbank flooding is occurring in lowlands
from Middle-South mouth confluence to Russian Mission,
including significant backwater up the Andreafsky River.
Residents in these communities and throughout the Yukon River
Delta should be prepared for a long period of high water even
after the ice jams release.
