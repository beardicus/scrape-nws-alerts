<description>...Brief Landspout Tornadoes Possible...
At 430 PM MDT/530 PM CDT/, conditions are becoming favorable for the
development of landspout tornadoes across the greater northwestern
Kansas area, if storms are able to form. However, at this time it is
unknown which if any storm would produce a landspout. Any tornadoes
which develop are expected to pose a limited threat.
Locations impacted include...
Colby, Goodland, Norton, Oakley, Oberlin, Hill City and Hoxie.
To report severe weather, contact your nearest law enforcement
agency. They will send your report to the National Weather Service
office in Goodland.
Landspout tornadoes can form with a developing thunderstorm before
rain, hail, and even thunder is observed. Landspout tornadoes are not
usually associated with a wall cloud and are often difficult to
detect with weather radar.
