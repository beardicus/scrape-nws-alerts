<headline>Flood Warning issued May 28 at 8:35AM CDT until May 29 at 4:00PM CDT by NWS Midland-Odessa</headline>
<description>...Forecast flooding changed from Minor to Moderate severity and
increased in duration for the following rivers in Texas...
Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch affecting Brewster County.
.Thunderstorms Saturday night produced heavy rainfall along the Rio
Grande in the vicinity of Johnson Ranch.  As a result, the Rio
Grande has risen to moderate flood stage at Johnson Ranch.
For the Rio Grande...including Presidio International Bridge,
Presidio 5SE, Castolon, Johnson Ranch...Moderate flooding is
forecast.
...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL TOMORROW AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Moderate flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch.
* WHEN...Until tomorrow afternoon.
* IMPACTS...At 12.0 feet (3.7 meters), the river reaches bankfull,
minor lowland flooding occurs, and no significant damage is
expected.
At 15.0 feet (4.6 meters), flood stage is reached.  Moderate
lowland flooding begins.  Roads that lead to Cottonwood Campground
and River Road may flood.  Stages are practically synonymous with
the gage at Cottonwood Campground at Castolon (CSTT2), and
therefore represent the reach from Santa Elena Canyon through
Cottonwood Campground, where damage may occur.  Cattle also graze
in the lowlands, and may be threatened.
At 19.0 feet (5.8 meters), the river reaches major flood stage.
Flooding begins to occur upstream in Cottonwood Campground at
Castolon, as stages at each location are practically synonymous.
Moderate lowland flooding begins at the gage site, but no damage
occurs.  The gage is inaccessible, as River Road is impassable at
several locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 8:15 AM CDT Sunday the stage was 11.3 feet (3.4 meters).
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above flood stage
late this morning to a crest of 18.6 feet (5.7 meters) late
this afternoon. It will then fall below flood stage late
tonight.
- Flood stage is 15.0 feet (4.6 meters).
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
17.1 feet (5.2 meters) on 09/01/2022.
