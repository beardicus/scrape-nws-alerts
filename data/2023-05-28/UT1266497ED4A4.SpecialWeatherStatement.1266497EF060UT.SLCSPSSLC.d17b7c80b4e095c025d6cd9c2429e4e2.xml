<headline>Special Weather Statement issued May 28 at 7:29PM MDT  by NWS Saltlake</headline>
<description>...A strong thunderstorm will impact portions of central Utah County
through 800 PM MDT...
At 728 PM MDT, Doppler radar was tracking a strong thunderstorm near
Provo, moving northeast at 15 mph.
HAZARD...Wind gusts up to 50 mph and nickel size hail.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around
unsecured objects. Minor damage to outdoor objects is
possible.
Locations impacted include...
Provo, Orem, Spanish Fork, Springville, Utah Lake, Brigham Young
University, Palmyra and Lake Shore.
This storm will be capable of producing strong gusty winds on Utah
Lake. This will lead to a sudden increase in waves and very choppy
waters which will result in hazardous boating conditions. Boaters are
urged to seek safe harbor if possible.
This includes Interstate 15 between mile markers 260 and 268.
MAX HAIL SIZE...0.88 IN
MAX WIND GUST...50 MPH</description>
<instruction>If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.
If on or near Utah Lake, get out of the water and move indoors or
inside a vehicle. Remember, lightning can strike out to 10 miles
from the parent thunderstorm. If you can hear thunder, you are close
enough to be struck by lightning. Move to safe shelter now! Do not
be caught on the water in a thunderstorm.</instruction>
