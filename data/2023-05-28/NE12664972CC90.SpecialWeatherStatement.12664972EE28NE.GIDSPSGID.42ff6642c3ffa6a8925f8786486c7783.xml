<description>...Strong thunderstorms will impact portions of Furnas County through
630 PM CDT...
At 543 PM CDT, Doppler radar was tracking strong thunderstorms
capable of perhaps producing a landspout tornado along a line
extending from Beaver City to 6 miles south of Lebanon. Movement was
north at 10 mph.
HAZARD...Winds in excess of 40 mph, and penny size hail are the main
threats. A brief landspout tornado cannot be ruled out in
the area, but this threat is currently higher just south of
Furnas County.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Minor damage to outdoor objects is possible. Gusty winds
could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured
objects.
Locations impacted include...
Beaver City, Edison, Wilsonville and Hendley.
LANDSPOUT...POSSIBLE
MAX HAIL SIZE...0.75 IN
MAX WIND GUST...40 MPH</description>
<instruction>If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.
These storms may intensify, so be certain to monitor local radio
stations and available television stations for additional information
and possible warnings from the National Weather Service.</instruction>
