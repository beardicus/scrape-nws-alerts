<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued May 28 at 3:23AM EDT until May 28 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM EDT THIS
MORNING...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM EDT THIS
MORNING THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 6 to
8 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards Statement,
dangerous rip currents and large breaking waves expected in the
surf zone.
* WHERE...The beaches from Duck to Ocracoke.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 AM EDT this
morning. For the Beach Hazards Statement, from 8 AM EDT this
morning through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore
break can throw a swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom
causing neck and back injuries.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most likely time for strong rip
currents to occur is a couple hours either side of low tide,
which will occur around 9 AM this morning.</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
