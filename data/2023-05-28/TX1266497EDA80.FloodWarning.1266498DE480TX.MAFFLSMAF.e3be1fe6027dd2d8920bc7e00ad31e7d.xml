<headline>Flood Warning issued May 28 at 8:44PM CDT until May 29 at 7:00PM CDT by NWS Midland-Odessa</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in Texas...
Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch affecting Brewster County.
Rio Grande at Boquillas affecting Brewster County.
.River levels on the Rio Grande will continue falling from Presidio
to Boquillas.
For the Rio Grande...including Johnson Ranch, Boquillas...Moderate
flooding is forecast.
...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL TOMORROW EVENING...
* WHAT...Moderate flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch.
* WHEN...Until tomorrow evening.
* IMPACTS...At 12.0 feet (3.7 meters), the river reaches bankfull,
minor lowland flooding occurs, and no significant damage is
expected.
At 15.0 feet (4.6 meters), flood stage is reached.  Moderate
lowland flooding begins.  Roads that lead to Cottonwood Campground
and River Road may flood.  Stages are practically synonymous with
the gage at Cottonwood Campground at Castolon (CSTT2), and
therefore represent the reach from Santa Elena Canyon through
Cottonwood Campground, where damage may occur.  Cattle also graze
in the lowlands, and may be threatened.
At 19.0 feet (5.8 meters), the river reaches major flood stage.
Flooding begins to occur upstream in Cottonwood Campground at
Castolon, as stages at each location are practically synonymous.
Moderate lowland flooding begins at the gage site, but no damage
occurs.  The gage is inaccessible, as River Road is impassable at
several locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 8:15 PM CDT Sunday the stage was 11.3 feet (3.4 meters).
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above flood stage
late this evening to a crest of 18.1 feet (5.5 meters) late
this evening. It will then fall below flood stage tomorrow
morning.
- Flood stage is 15.0 feet (4.6 meters).
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
16.2 feet (4.9 meters) on 09/16/2022.
