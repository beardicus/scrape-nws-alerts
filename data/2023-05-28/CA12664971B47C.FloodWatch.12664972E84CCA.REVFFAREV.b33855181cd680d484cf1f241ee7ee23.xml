<headline>Flood Watch issued May 28 at 8:27AM PDT  by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH MONDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of California and Nevada, including the following
areas, in California, Greater Lake Tahoe Area, Lassen-Eastern
Plumas-Eastern Sierra Counties, Mono County and Surprise Valley
California. In Nevada, Greater Lake Tahoe Area, Greater
Reno-Carson City-Minden Area and Northern Washoe County.
* WHEN...From Monday afternoon through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Area creeks and streams are running high and could flood with
heavy rain. Extensive street flooding is also possible in
urbanized locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Slow moving thunderstorms will produce areas of heavy
rainfall. Soils are already saturated with creeks, streams,
and rivers running full due to ongoing snowmelt. It will not
take as much rain to cause excessive runoff. Also, heavy
rainfall may lead to flash flooding and debris flows near
burn scars.
