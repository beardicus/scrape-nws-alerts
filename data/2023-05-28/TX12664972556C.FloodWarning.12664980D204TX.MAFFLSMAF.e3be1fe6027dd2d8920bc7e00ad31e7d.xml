...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in Texas...
Rio Grande at Boquillas affecting Brewster County.
...The Flood Warning is cancelled for the following rivers in
Texas...
Rio Grande at Presidio International Bridge affecting Presidio
County.
Rio Grande below Presidio 5SE affecting Presidio County.
Rio Grande at Castolon affecting Brewster County.
.River levels on the Rio Grande will continue falling from Pesido to
Boquillas.  However, additional thunderstorms are expected in the
area overnight, and may result in additional flooding.
For the Rio Grande...including Presidio International Bridge,
Presidio 5SE, Castolon, Johnson Ranch, Boquillas...Moderate flooding
is forecast.
...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL LATE TOMORROW MORNING...
* WHAT...Moderate flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch.
* WHEN...Until late tomorrow morning.
* IMPACTS...At 12.0 feet (3.7 meters), the river reaches bankfull,
minor lowland flooding occurs, and no significant damage is
expected.
At 15.0 feet (4.6 meters), flood stage is reached.  Moderate
lowland flooding begins.  Roads that lead to Cottonwood Campground
and River Road may flood.  Stages are practically synonymous with
the gage at Cottonwood Campground at Castolon (CSTT2), and
therefore represent the reach from Santa Elena Canyon through
Cottonwood Campground, where damage may occur.  Cattle also graze
in the lowlands, and may be threatened.
At 19.0 feet (5.8 meters), the river reaches major flood stage.
Flooding begins to occur upstream in Cottonwood Campground at
Castolon, as stages at each location are practically synonymous.
Moderate lowland flooding begins at the gage site, but no damage
occurs.  The gage is inaccessible, as River Road is impassable at
several locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 2:15 PM CDT Sunday the stage was 11.3 feet (3.4 meters).
- Forecast...The river will fall to 10.5 feet (3.2 meters)
early tomorrow afternoon. It will then rise to 10.6 feet (3.2
meters) tomorrow afternoon. It will fall to 6.4 feet (2.0
meters) early Tuesday afternoon. It will then rise to 6.5
feet (2.0 meters) late Tuesday evening. It will fall again
and remain below flood stage.
