* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Central to Southwestern Anderson County, South Carolina
* WHEN...Until 630 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks, greenways,

Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.  A few flood-
prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1237 PM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated between 2-4 inches of rain has fallen over the past
6-8 hours from the city of Anderson south and west towards
Lake Hartwell, Homeland Park, Starr, and Iva.  Nuisance
flooding is possible in isolated areas over the next several
hours has excessive runoff creates rapid rises on small
stream and drainages.  Ares near Starr are most susceptible
to seeing high streamflows and flooding, including along
Weems Creek near Rainey Rd and Brooks McGee Rd and Buchannan
Creek near SC 187.
- Little additional rainfall is expected over the next few
hours, but additional heavy rainfall is possible later this
afternoon and tonight.  Given saturated soils, this rainfall
may quickly cause new areas of flooding to develop,
therefore, please stay weather aware and be prepared to seek
higher ground should a Flash Flood Warning be issued.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Anderson, Homeland Park, Iva, Starr, Anderson Airport, Lake
Hartwell, Lake Russell and Sadlers Creek State Park.
