<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 03 at 4:36PM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 1030 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Nuisance to Minor flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
expected.
* WHERE...A portion of upstate South Carolina, including the
following counties, Greenville and Pickens.
* WHEN...Until 1030 PM EDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
Dangerous flows over low-water crossings. Some low-water crossings
may become impassable. River or stream flows are elevated.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 428 PM EDT, Doppler radar and raingauges are indicating an
axis of training heavy showers are impacting portions of
northeast Pickens and northern Greenville counties.  Between
1-3 inches of rainfall has occurred over the past 2-3 hours
on top of rainfall from earlier this morning.  This is going
to cause significant rises on small streams in the Advisory
area, especially along Oolenoy River.  Areas of greatest
flood concern include along and near Table Rock Rd, Oolenoy
Church Rd, Dalton Rd, Pace Bridge Rd, and Pumpkintown Hwy.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are expected
over the area. Given saturated soils, more significant
flooding could occur and a Flash Flood Warning may be
required.  Please stay weather aware and be prepared to seek
higher ground.  It is best to avoid all low-lying areas for
the next several hours in case flooding develops and worsens.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Travelers Rest, Slater-Marietta, Cherrydale Point, Lake
Robinson, Table Rock State Park, Jocassee Gorges, Dacusville,
Cleveland, Pumpkintown, Sassafras Mountain, Sunset and Rocky
Bottom.

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
