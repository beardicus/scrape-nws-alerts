<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 03 at 3:26PM EDT until August 03 at 11:00PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 730 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...A portion of upstate South Carolina, including the
following counties, Greenville and Spartanburg.
* WHEN...Until 730 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks, greenways,
boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and parking lots.
Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.  A few flood-
prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 320 PM EDT, Area streamgauges show that larger streams,
including the South Pacolet River and Middle Tyger River, are
still rising following earlier heavy rainfall.  Areas of
northeastern Greenville County and northwestern Spartanburg
County have seen 2-4 inches of rain, with isolated rain
gauges reporting 5 inches since early this morning.  This is
causing excessive runoff and rapid rises on area streams,
with isolated areas of nuisance flooding.  Given that larger
streams have not yet crested, the Flood Advisory will be
extended to allow these streams to crest and recede.
Isolated areas of high water and nuisance flooding are
expected to continue for the next 1-2 hours.
- Additional heavy rainfall is not imminent, but new rounds of
showers and storms are expected into this evening.  Given
saturated soils, this rainfall may quickly cause new areas of
flooding to develop, therefore, please stay weather aware and
be prepared to seek higher ground should a Flash Flood
Warning be issued.
- Some locations that mayexperience flooding include...
Landrum, Campobello, Lake Robinson, Tigerville, Lake Bowen,
Pleasant Ridge State Park, Gowensville, Glassy Mountain,
North Saluda Reservoir and Fingerville.

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
