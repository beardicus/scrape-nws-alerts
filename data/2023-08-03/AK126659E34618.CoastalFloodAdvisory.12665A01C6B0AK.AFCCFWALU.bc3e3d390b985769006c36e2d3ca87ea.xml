<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM TO 7 PM AKDT
SATURDAY...
The National Weather Service in Anchorage has issued a Coastal
Flood Advisory, which is in effect from 1 AM to 7 PM AKDT
Saturday.
* LOCATION...Kuskokwim Delta and Nunivak Island
* COASTAL FLOODING...Water levels are expected to rise during high
tides, 3 to 5 feet above normal highest tide.
* TIMING...1 AM to 7 PM AKST Saturday. West of Kipnuk, including
Nunivak Island, can experience two tidal peaks above normal
highest tide early Saturday morning and again Saturday
afternoon. Kipnuk eastward will peak Saturday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...South to southeasterly winds with gusts of 45 to 60
mph from a strong storm for this time of year will begin to
increase late Friday evening and last through Saturday
afternoon. Resulting higher seas and surf, coinciding with high
tide, would raise the potential for both flooding among low
lying areas and coastal erosion for communities along the
Kuskokwim Delta coast and Nunivak Island.</description>
<instruction>A coastal flood advisory indicates that onshore winds and tides
will combine to generate flooding of low areas along the shore.</instruction>
