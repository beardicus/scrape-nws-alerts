<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued August 03 at 5:06PM EDT until August 03 at 11:00PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
Northwestern Greenville County in upstate South Carolina...
Northeastern Pickens County in upstate South Carolina...
* Until 1100 PM EDT.
* At 506 PM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated
heavy rain falling across the warned area with flash flooding
imminent. Between 2 and 3 inches of rain have fallen on top of
heavy rainfall from earlier this morning.  Flash flooding is
ongoing or expected to begin shortly.  Areas of greatest flood
concern are around Pumpkintown and within the Oolenoy River basin,
including along and near Table Rock Rd, Oolenoy Church Rd, Dalton
Rd, Pace Bridge Rd, and Pumpkintown Hwy.  Please avoid all
low-water crossings and low-spots near area streams for the next
few hours.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by heavy rain.
SOURCE...Radar and automated gauges.
IMPACT...Common, deeper flash-flooding of low-lying areas
adjacent to area  streams is developing with lesser
impacts to vulnerable property.  Expect extensive
flash flooding of farmland, parks, greenways, boat-
access areas, and golf courses.  Inundation may be
several feet deep. Other flood-prone areas will be
impacted including low-lying roadways, low-water
crossings, underpasses, and parking lots. Several low-
water  crossings, roads, and bridges may be flooded
and impassible, with  deeper flows over roadways
possible.
* Some locations that may experience flash flooding include...
Travelers Rest, Slater-Marietta, Table Rock State Park,
Pumpkintown, Cleveland and Sunset.
Heavy rainfall is subsiding and additional heavy rainfall is not
expected.  However, it will take several hours for the excessive
runoff to subside and streams to rise, crest, and subside.  Please
exercise extreme caution in this area through the evening hours.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR AND GAUGE INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
