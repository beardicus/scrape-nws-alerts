        <headline>Flood Advisory issued July 17 at 8:48PM EDT until July 17 at 11:45PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg SC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.

* WHERE...A portion of western North Carolina, including the
following county, Madison.

* WHEN...Until 1145 PM EDT.

* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks,
greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and
parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.
A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.  A
small culvert washout or two is possible.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 838 PM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicate heavy rain is ongoing across portions of western
Madison County within the Spring Creek watershed as multiple
thunderstorm cells move across the area. Between 1 and 2.5
inches of rainfall has been observed over the past 30-45
minutes, with the highest totals occurring along NC 209.
This rainfall is likely to produce excessive runoff within
several drainages feeding Spring Creek, including Reservoir
Branch, Bear Branch, Little Bottom Branch, and Long Mountain
Branch.  High flows within these and other feeder streams
will cause significant rises along Spring Creek, Shut-In
Creek, and other adjacent tributaries feeding the French
Broad River near Hot Springs.  Areas of nuisance to Minor
flooding may develop over the next 30-60 minutes around the
Hot Springs area.

Areas of greatest concern include:
1) Spring Creek near NC 209
2) Shut-In Creek near Upper Shutin Rd and Church Rd
3) Beck Branch near Gorenflo Gap Rd

- If storm-total rainfall amounts exceed 3 inches over the next
30 minutes, more significant flooding may develop and a Flash
Flood Warning may be issued.  Caution is advised near any
stream or other vulnerable area.  Seek higher ground
immediately if streams start to rise.  Please have a plan in
place should flash flooding develop and do not hesitate to
act.

- Some locations that may experience nuisance flooding
include...
Hot Springs and Spring Creek.

        <instruction>In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.

Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
