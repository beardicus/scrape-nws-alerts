        <headline>Flood Advisory issued July 17 at 10:07PM EDT until July 17 at 11:45PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg SC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.

* WHERE...A portion of western Madison County, North Carolina

* WHEN...Until 1145 PM EDT.

* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to
streams   and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland,
parks, greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses,
and parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is
possible.  A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may become
impassible.  A small culvert washout or two is possible.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 951 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms have
departed western Madison County and heavy rainfall has ended
across the Spring Creek watershed.  Between 1.5 and 2.5
inches of rain was observed over a 60-minute period, with the
highest accumulations estimated near NC 209 and over Spring
Creek.  This heavy rainfall resulted in excessive runoff and
significant rises on small tributaries feeding Spring Creek,
including Reservoir Branch, Bear Branch, Little Bottom
Branch, Long Mountain Branch, and Beck Branch.  High flows
within these and other feeder steams have likely resulted in
significant rises along Spring Creek, Shut-In Creek, and
other adjacent tributaries feeding the French Broad River
near Hot Springs.  Areas of nuisance flooding remain possible
within the Advisory area over the next 60 minutes as high
flows move downstream towards the French Broad River.
Therefore, the Flood Advisory will remain in effect through
11pm to allow streams to crest and any areas of nuisance
flooding to recede.

Areas of greatest concern include:
1) Spring Creek near NC 209
2) Shut-In Creek near Upper Shutin Rd and Church Rd
3) Beck Branch near Gorenflo Gap Rd

- Some locations that may continue to experience nuisance
flooding include...
Hot Springs and Spring Creek.

        <instruction>In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.

Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
