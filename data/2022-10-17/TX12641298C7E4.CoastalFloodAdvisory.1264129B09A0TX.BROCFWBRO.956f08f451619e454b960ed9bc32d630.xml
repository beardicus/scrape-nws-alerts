<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued October 17 at 10:21PM CDT until October 18 at 1:00PM CDT by NWS Brownsville</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM CDT TUESDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH WEDNESDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding
expected. For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip
currents expected.
* WHERE...Kenedy Island, Willacy Island and Cameron Island
Counties.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 1 PM CDT Tuesday.
For the High Rip Current Risk, through Wednesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding is expected, with water reaching
or pushing into the dunes on South Padre Island. Vehicles,
except those with four wheel drive and high wheel bases, will
be unable to be driven on the beach. This includes locations
north of Public Beach Access #3. Minor to moderate beach
erosion is expected. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The potential for coastal flooding will
begin around high tide Tuesday morning, at 215 AM. Strong wave
energy peaking later Tuesday morning through early Tuesday
afternoon will likely keep run-up going even into the low tide
cycle, which begins soon after daybreak. A further extension of
the advisory may be needed Tuesday afternoon, or a Coastal Flood
Statement may replace the Advisory for gradually receding water
that could still near the dunes.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed mainly near Boca Chica Beach and at Public Access 4 through
6. Do not drive around barricades or through water of unknown
depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood- prone
property.
Swim near a lifeguard if at all possible. If caught in a rip
current, relax and float. Don`t swim against the current. If able,
swim in a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape,
face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
