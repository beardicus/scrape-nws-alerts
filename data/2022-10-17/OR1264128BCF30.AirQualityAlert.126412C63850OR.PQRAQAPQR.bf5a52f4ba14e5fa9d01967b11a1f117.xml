<description>...AIR QUALITY ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM PDT THURSDAY...
The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality has continued an Air
Quality Advisory, which is in effect until 6 PM PDT Thursday. Will
see improving air quality later Thursday afternoon, and on into the
weekend, as weather fronts will bring west to southwest winds, with
rain as early as Friday night.
A Smoke Air Quality Advisory remains in effect. Wildfires burning in
the region combined with forecasted conditions will cause air
quality to reach unhealthy levels at times through Thursday.
Pollutants in smoke can cause burning eyes, runny nose, aggravate
heart and lung diseases, and aggravate other serious health
problems. Limit outdoor activities and keep children indoors if it
is smoky. Please follow medical advice if you have a heart or lung
condition.
