<headline>Flood Advisory issued July 02 at 4:36PM EDT until July 02 at 9:00PM EDT by NWS Paducah</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 645 PM CDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Portions of southwest Indiana and western Kentucky,
including the following counties, in southwest Indiana, Spencer.
In western Kentucky, Daviess.
* WHEN...Until 645 PM CDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 334 PM CDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms. Minor flooding is ongoing or expected to begin
shortly in the advisory area. Radar estimates between 1 and 2
inches of rain per hour is falling, and additional storms
will be repeating over the same areas. Some of these areas,
like in Daviess County, have already received closed to 2
inches of rainfall from earlier storms, so they`ll be falling
on top of saturated or near saturated grounds. Localized
flooding is expected.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Owensboro, Rockport, Dale, Grandview, Whitesville,
Knottsville, Eureka, Masonville, Stanley, Santa Claus, St.
Joseph, Chrisney, Gentryville, Moseleyville, and Pleasant
Ridge.</description>
