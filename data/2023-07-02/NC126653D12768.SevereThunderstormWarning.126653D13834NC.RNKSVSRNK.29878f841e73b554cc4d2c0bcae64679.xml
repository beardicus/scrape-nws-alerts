ponding of water on roadways, standing water in low lying areas, and
minor flooding of creeks, streams, and areas of poor drainage.
Drivers are urged to slow down and use extra caution to avoid
hydroplaning.
Note, these storms have had a history of producing dangerous
cloud-to-ground lightning well away from the main storm area.
Remember, if you can hear thunder, you can be struck by lightning.
Remaining indoors until the storm has passed and you can no longer
hear any thunder.
When it is safe to do so, please send your reports of hail of any
size, as well as reports of any wind damage, including downed trees
or large limbs, to the National Weather Service by calling toll free
