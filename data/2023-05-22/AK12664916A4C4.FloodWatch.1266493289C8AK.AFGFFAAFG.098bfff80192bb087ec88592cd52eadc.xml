<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR SNOWMELT NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH WEDNESDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by snowmelt is occurring.
* WHERE...The Yukon River and Tributaries Draining the Eastern
Brooks Range
* WHEN...Through Wednesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Water levels are running bankfull and overbank in low
lying areas and minor flooding is possible. Some low lying roads
in Fort Yukon and Beaver are covered by water. Water is also
surrounding the runway in Fort Yukon. Remote cabins and fish camps
along along rivers may experience minor flooding and significant
bank erosion is likely.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rapid snowmelt in the Eastern Brooks Range is sending a large
volume of water down tributaries feeding the Yukon and
Porcupine River. This high water will continue to move down
the Porcupine and Yukon River over the next several days.
Some locations are seeing higher water than observed during
breakup.
- Http://weather.gov/aprfc
- If you live near or along the Yukon River, Porcupine River, and
other tributaries draining the Eastern Brooks Range should move
valuables to higher ground, and prepare to move yourself to higher
ground at short notice.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
