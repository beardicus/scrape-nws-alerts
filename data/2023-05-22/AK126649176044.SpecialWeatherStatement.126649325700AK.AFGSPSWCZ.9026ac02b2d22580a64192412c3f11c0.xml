<description>...High Water Levels Along the Yukon River Into the Weekend...
Water levels on the Yukon River will continue to rise and reach
bankfull and likely go overbank in low lying areas over the next
few days. A large ice jam upriver from Ruby released on Sunday and
this surge of water is currently moving down the Yukon River. Some
low lying fish camps or remote cabins along the river could be
impacted. At this time, flooding is not expected in Grayling,
Anvik, or Holy Cross but residents should be prepared for high
water by moving items away from the river. The NWS will continue
to monitor this situation and provide updates if conditions
change.
At Russian Mission, an ice jam is causing significant flooding in
the community. See the Flood Warning for Russian Mission for more
details.</description>
