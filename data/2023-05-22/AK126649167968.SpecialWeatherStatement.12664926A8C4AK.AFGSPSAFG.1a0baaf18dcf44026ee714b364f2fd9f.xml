<description>...High Water On Most Rivers This Week...
Heavy snowmelt in the Brooks Range is causing water levels to
rise on many rivers draining the south side of the Brooks Range.
Larger rivers such as the the Colleen, the Sheenjek, the
Chandalar and the Koyukuk, and their tributaries, all have high
water. There is a risk of minor flooding this week along all of
these rivers due to the high water from snowmelt. There is also a
risk that ice jams could form and cause localized ice jam
flooding on these rivers this week.
People along rivers should prepare for the possibility of high
water levels this week due to ice breakup and snowmelt runoff.
River access points and gravel bars will likely be covered with
water along with increased debris in rivers.
The latest breakup information is available at
