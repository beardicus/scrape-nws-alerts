<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam is possible.
* WHERE...The Lower Yukon River From Marshall Downriver to the Coast
* WHEN...Through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Impacts could range between localized high water and
severe flooding. Now is the time to take precautions. Where
possible, move items to higher ground and prepare your community
for possible flooding. Flooding of fish camps and other remote
cabins along this stretch of the Yukon River is possible as well.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A large surge of water and ice from an ice jam that released
above Ruby is moving downriver. This high water will be
moving through the lower Yukon River this week. Ice is still
in place on portions of the lower Yukon and as this surge of
water arrives, it will likely cause ice jams to form. Water
levels may rise rapidly with little notice.

If you live near or along the Yukon River from Marshall downriver to
the coast, please stay alert and be prepared to take action.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
