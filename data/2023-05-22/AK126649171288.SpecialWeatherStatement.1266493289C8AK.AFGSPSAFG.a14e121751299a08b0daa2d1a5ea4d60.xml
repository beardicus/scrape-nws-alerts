<description>...High Water Continues Along the Yukon River And Lower Nowitna
Rivers...
The ice jam near the Kokrines Bible Camp broke early Sunday
morning and water levels dropped along the Yukon River and Lower
Nowitna River. Water levels at Tanana have dropped about 2.5 feet
since Saturday, and roads in Tanana are now above water. High
water on the Yukon River upstream of Tanana will make its way
down to Tanana today and Tuesday, causing water levels to fluctuate
slightly. It is expected that any water level rise at Tanana will
be less than one foot through Tuesday.
Water will continue to slowly drain back into the river over the
next several days. Some poorly drained areas like old sloughs will
keep water for many days. Ice that is up on shore will remain for
many days until it melts.</description>
