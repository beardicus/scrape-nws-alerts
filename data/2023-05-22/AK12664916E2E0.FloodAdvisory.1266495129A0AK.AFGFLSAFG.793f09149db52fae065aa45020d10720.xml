<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY FOR AN ICE JAM RELEASE NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM
AKDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam release continues.
* WHERE...Yukon River from Ruby to Kaltag, including Galena, Koyukuk
and Nulato
* WHEN...Until 600 PM AKDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding is occurring along the Yukon River
between Ruby and Nulato. Water is overbank into low lying areas
along much of the Yukon River. Water may impact fish camps and
other remote cabins along the river.
In Galena, several roads are inundated with water. Sheds and other
structures along lakes in the community are impacted by floodwaters.
Water levels will continue to rise in Galena over the next 12 to 24
hours and the extent of flooding will likely increase. Water levels
are expected to slowly start to recede by Wednesday.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 10 AM AKDT, A very large ice jam above Ruby that released
on Sunday continues to send a surge of water and ice
downriver. The large amount of water that was backed up
behind this ice jam will take many days to drain so water
levels on the Yukon will remain high for a number of days.
- Flooding is not expected in Ruby or Kaltag due to the
communities higher elevation above the river.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Nulato, Koyukuk and Galena.
- For Yukon River at Galena:
At 10:00am Monday the stage was 124.4 feet.
Flood Stage is 124.0 feet.

- If you live near or along the Yukon between Ruby and Kaltag
prepare for minor flooding. Move valuables such as vehicles and
boats out of low lying areas and store them on higher ground.</description>
