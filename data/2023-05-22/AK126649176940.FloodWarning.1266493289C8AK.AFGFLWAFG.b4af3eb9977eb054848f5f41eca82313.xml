WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by snowmelt continues.
* WHERE...Yukon River at Stevens Village.
* WHEN...Until 1000 PM AKDT Wednesday.

the village may have water surround or flood them.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 300 PM AKDT, Rapid snowmelt in the Eastern Brooks Range
continues to send a large volume of water down tributaries
feeding the Yukon and Porcupine River. This high water will
continue to move down the Yukon River over the next several
days. Stevens Village is seeing higher water than observed
during breakup.
- Expect river levels to continue a slow rise and crest over
the next day or two. Even after water levels begin fall, they
will remain high into next week.
