This local statement provides important information and recommended
actions for people in Guam and the Northern Marianas. This also
includes Ulul and Polowat in western Chuuk State and Satawal in
eastern Yap State and surrounding islands.
.Watches/Warnings...
A Tropical Storm Warning remains in effect for Satawal in eastern Yap

A Flood Watch is in effect for Guam and the Northern Marianas. Please

.STORM INFORMATION...
At 7 AM ChST...the center of Typhoon Mawar (02W) was located near
latitude 8.8N...longitude 148.0E. This was about 390 miles southeast
of Guam. Storm motion was NNW, and intensity was 85 mph.
.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
When making decisions...do not focus on the exact forecast track. TY
Mawar (02W) continues to strengthen over the northern FSM and is
moving slowly north-northwest. It is too early to provide exact wind
and surge forecast values for specific locations in the Marianas. A
general concern should be for the possibility of at least extensive
damage somewhere within Mariana Islands.
.PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
For those under a warning, preparations according to your typhoon
disaster plan should be well under way or complete. Remain in shelter
until the all clear is given by your local emergency management
authority.
For those under a watch, now is the time to begin preparing your
home or business according to your typhoon disaster plan. Listen
for possible warnings and be ready to evacuate if necessary. Heed
the advice of local officials and comply with any orders that are
issued.
For interests at ports, docks and marinas, it is recommended that
you perform the prescribed preparations according to your emergency
operations plan for tropical cyclones. If you live on a boat, begin
to safely secure your craft and make plans to leave it for adequate
land-based shelter. Listen for possible warnings.
Regarding the coastal waters under a watch, small craft should
return to port or seek safe harbor.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for possible changes to the
forecast.
For additional precautionary and preparedness information, please
refer to the detailed recommendations relative to your location
as further described by your local National Weather Service office
and your local emergency management.
&amp;&amp;
.NEXT UPDATE...
The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather
Service in Tiyan around 3 PM...or sooner if conditions warrant.
...Typhoon Watch remains in effect...
...New Information...
Typhoon Mawar (02W) continues to strengthen.
...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Stay calm and keep informed. Comply with any evacuation orders that
are issued for your area. If your home is vulnerable to high winds,
or you live in a surge zone or any location prone to flooding,
evacuate to a designated shelter or ride out the storm in the sturdy
home of family or friends.
Items to bring to a shelter include a first aid kit, medicines and
prescriptions, baby food and diapers, games and books, toiletries, a
battery powered radio, a cell phone, flashlights with extra
batteries, a blanket or sleeping bag for each person, personal
identification, copies of key papers such as insurance policies,
available cash and credit cards. Remember, pets are not allowed in
most public shelters, so check ahead with your intended shelter.
Regarding your home or business, cover all windows and doors with
shutters or plywood. Move patio furniture and other loose objects
indoors. Brace all exterior doors, including garage doors. Do this as
early as possible.
If you need to make a trip to the hardware store, the grocery
store, or the gas station, do so as early as possible.
