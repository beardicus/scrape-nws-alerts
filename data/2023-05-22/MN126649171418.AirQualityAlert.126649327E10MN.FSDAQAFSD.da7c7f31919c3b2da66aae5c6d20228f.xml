<headline>Air Quality Alert issued May 22 at 4:34PM CDT  by NWS Sioux Falls</headline>
<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT FROM 12 PM CDT TUESDAY THROUGH 8 PM
CDT TUESDAY...
* WHAT...The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has issued an Air
Quality Alert for ozone pollution. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is
expected to reach the Orange or Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups
category.
* WHERE...southwest Minnesota.
* WHEN...From 12 PM CDT Tuesday through 8 PM CDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease
(including asthma), heart disease, children and older adults, and
people who are active outdoors, may experience health effects.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Ground-level ozone is expected to be high
during the afternoon hours on Tuesday, and air quality is expected to
reach the Orange (unhealthy for sensitive groups) AQI category across
southern Minnesota. Southerly winds are transporting pollutants into
the state. Sunny skies, warm temperatures, and low humidity will
allow these pollutants to react in the air to produce ground-level
ozone. Ozone will be highest during the afternoon and early evening
hours when sunshine is most abundant, and temperatures are highest.
Air quality is expected to reach the Orange AQI category. This is
considered unhealthy for sensitive groups.

<instruction>Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including
asthma), heart disease, children and older adults, and people who are
active outdoors, should limit prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion.
Reduce or eliminate activities that contribute to air pollution, such
as outdoor burning, and use of residential wood burning devices.
Reduce vehicle trips and vehicle idling as much as possible.</instruction>
