<description>...FLOOD WARNING FOR SNOWMELT IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON AKDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by snowmelt is expected.
* WHERE...The Yukon and Porcupine River at Fort Yukon
* WHEN...Until noon AKDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Water levels east of town by the gravel pits have slowly
come up over the past several days, impacting the road by the
Voc-Ed building and into 6th and 7th Ave. Several residences in
low-lying areas have flooded. There is also water around the north
end of the runway. The road east of the Tribal Hall has been
breached to reduce water levels and allow water to flow back
towards the Yukon River.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 400 PM AKDT, runoff from snowmelt is sending a large
volume of water down tributaries feeding the Porcupine River.
While the Porcupine and Yukon Rivers continue a slow
recession, lingering snow in the basin will continue to melt
in very warm conditions. This will lead to continued
potential for rising water level in Fort Yukon.

- If you live near or along the Yukon or Porcupine River at Fort
Yukon stay alert and be prepared to take action.</description>
