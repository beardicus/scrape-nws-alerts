- A surge of moisture is starting to move north of the southern
panhandle, however, the precipitation in the basin from
before and the end of the showers are continuing to drain
into reservior and streams. Upwards of 4 to 7 inches of

began Tuesday morning with the Ketchikan area reporting some
of the largest amounts. Streams and rivers may continue to
rise into this afternoon. The highest likelihood of any
flooding will be for smaller/flashier streams and basins.
This is a evolving and changing situation. Stay tuned to the
National Weather Service for updates at weather.gov/Juneau
and on social media.</description>
