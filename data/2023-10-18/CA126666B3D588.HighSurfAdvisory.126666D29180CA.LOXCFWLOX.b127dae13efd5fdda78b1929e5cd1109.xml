<headline>High Surf Advisory issued October 18 at 7:58PM PDT until October 20 at 9:00PM PDT by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT TONIGHT TO
9 PM PDT FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Large breaking waves will build to 5 to 8 feet tonight,
then to 7 to 9 feet with local sets to 10 feet Thursday,
continuing through Friday. Surf will subside slowly by late
Friday afternoon and evening. There will also be a high risk of
dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Ventura County Beaches.
* WHEN...From midnight tonight to 9 PM PDT Friday.
* IMPACTS...There is an increased risk for ocean drowning. Rip
currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Large
breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and
rocks, and capsize small boats near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Surf will be highest on west and northwest
facing beaches. Nuisance to locally minor coastal flooding is
possible near the high tide around noon Thursday.</description>
<instruction>Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly
locations in such conditions, so stay off the rocks.</instruction>
