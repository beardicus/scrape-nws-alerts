<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Heavy snow and blowing snow possible. Total snow
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches possible. Winds could gust as
high as 60 mph. Visibility reduced to one-half mile at times.
* WHERE...Central Aleutians.
* WHEN...From Monday afternoon through Tuesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Plan on difficult travel conditions. Blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Adak is expected to remain mostly all
snow throughout the event. Atka is expected to start as snow
Monday afternoon, then change over to rain as warmer air works
in Monday evening. A changeover back to snow is possible for
Tuesday as the storm moves by to the east and colder air works
back in on the backside of the system. Therefore, highest snow
accumulations are expected for Adak with amounts on the lower
end for Atka.</description>
