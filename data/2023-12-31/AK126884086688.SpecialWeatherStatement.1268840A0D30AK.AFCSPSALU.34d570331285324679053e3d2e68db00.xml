<description>...STRONG WINDS DEVELOPING WITH SNOW AND BLOWING SNOW CHANGING TO
RAIN MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...
A series of strong storm systems moving into the Bering Sea will
bring a prolonged period of strong east to southeast winds to much
of Bristol Bay and the Kuskokwim Delta between Monday and
Wednesday morning. Areas of light snow will spread northward with
the first system moving south of the Alaska Peninsula on Monday,
with the best potential for accumulating snowfall focused along
the coast. Wind gusts near the coast will pick up to between 25 and
40 mph by Monday morning, possibly leading to areas of blowing
snow and reduced visibility at times. Temperatures will warm above
freezing across Bristol Bay by Monday afternoon, then most the
Kuskokwim Delta by Tuesday, ending the threat for blowing snow.
A second, much stronger system moving into the Bering Sea will
push a strong front into the Southwest Coast between Tuesday and
Wednesday. While confidence for the exact timing and strength of
this front is lower, there is the potential for even stronger
winds to affect parts of the region during this timeframe. Wind
gusts will be particularly strong across portions of Bristol Bay,
with peak gusts of 50 to 70 mph possible between Tuesday
afternoon and Wednesday morning, while gusts as high as 40 to 60
mph will be possible across the Kuskokwim Delta.
Communities should prepare for difficult travel conditions
through midweek and continue to closely monitor the forecast as
details for both upcoming systems become clearer.</description>
