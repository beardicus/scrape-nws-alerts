<headline>High Wind Watch issued December 31 at 5:40PM AKST until January 03 at 9:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WATCH IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH
WEDNESDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...East to southeast winds 35 to 45 mph with gusts up to 80
mph possible.
* WHERE...Bristol Bay.
* WHEN...From Tuesday morning through Wednesday morning.
* IMPACTS...High winds could move loose debris, damage property,
and cause power outages. Travel could be difficult. Gusty winds
may cause blowing and drifting of snow. Any blowing snow may
significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A strong frontal system will allow
southeasterly winds to increase beginning Tuesday morning. Winds
will peak in intensity from west to east across coastal and
interior Bristol Bay through Tuesday evening. Gusts to 65 mph
are likely along the immediate coast through Tuesday night with
gusts to 80 mph likely from Iliamna to Koliganek and New
Stuyahok through Wednesday morning. Areas of blowing and
drifting snow are possible during the onset of these winds.
However, temperatures are expected to climb above freezing
through the day Tuesday ending any threat of blowing snow and
changing any snow falling to rain.</description>
<instruction>A high wind watch means there is potential for a hazardous high
wind event. Monitor the latest forecasts and warnings for updates
on this situation. Fasten loose objects or shelter objects in a
safe location prior to the onset of winds.</instruction>
