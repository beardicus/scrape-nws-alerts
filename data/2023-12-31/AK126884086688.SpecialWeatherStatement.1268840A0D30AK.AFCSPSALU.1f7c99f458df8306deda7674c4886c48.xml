<description>...STRONG WINDS DEVELOPING WITH SNOW AND BLOWING SNOW CHANGING TO
RAIN TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH TUESDAY EVENING...
A strong low pressure system is poised to move along the Aleutian
Chain Tuesday morning before entering the southern Bering Sea
Tuesday evening and overnight. Easterly to east-northeasterly
winds will pick up Tuesday morning and peak with gusts to 60 mph
in the afternoon to early evening. Winds begin to weaken and turn
more northeasterly during the late evening and overnight hours.
The front will reach the Pribilof Islands late Tuesday morning
into the early afternoon hours. Precipitation will begin from
south to north as the winds are peaking. There could be enough
cold air in place initially that St. Paul Island could experience
a period of snow and blowing snow late Tuesday morning into the
afternoon hours before mixing with and changing over to rain.</description>
