<description>A Period of Snow Expected Late This Afternoon and Evening...
Snow is expected most likely between 3 PM and 8 PM this afternoon
into this evening. Accumulations around an inch to perhaps two
inches are expected during this time for elevations above 2500
feet with temperatures around 30 to 32 degrees. The ridges along
Interstate 68 will be impacted by the snowfall and surfaces may
become snow covered and slippery. Use caution when driving. For
lower elevations below 2500 feet. Snow may mix with rain and a
slushy coating is possible with temperatures slightly above
freezing.
Snowfall rates will decrease later this evening with temperatures
near or slightly above freezing for most areas before a steadier
snow arrives toward Monday morning with additional accumulations
around 1 to 3 inches most likely through Monday afternoon.
Temperatures will fall below freezing during this time, causing
snow covered and slippery surfaces.</description>
