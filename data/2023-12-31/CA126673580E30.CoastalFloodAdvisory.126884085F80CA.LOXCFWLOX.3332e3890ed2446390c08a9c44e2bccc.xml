<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM PST THIS
EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM PST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding.
For the High Surf Advisory, breaking waves of 6 to 9 feet with
local sets to 12 feet, highest on west facing shores. Strong
rip currents.
* WHERE...Catalina and Santa Barbara Islands, Malibu Coast and
Los Angeles County Beaches.
* WHEN...Until 8 PM PST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding of sea water is possible around the

NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
