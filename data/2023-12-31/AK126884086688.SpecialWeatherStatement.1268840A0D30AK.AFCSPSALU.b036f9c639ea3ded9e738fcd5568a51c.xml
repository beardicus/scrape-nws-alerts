<description>...STRONG WINDS AND HEAVY PRECIPITATION TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...
A strong low pressure system is poised to move along the Aleutian
Chain Tuesday morning before entering the southern Bering Sea
Tuesday evening and overnight. Southeasterly winds initially pick
up Tuesday morning as the front lifts from the North Pacific to
over the area on Tuesday. Winds look to peak mid-morning Tuesday
with gusts between 45 to 60 mph before weakening in the
afternoon. While most precipitation should be in liquid form for
the region, Cold Bay could see a brief period of snow Tuesday
morning before changing to rain late Tuesday morning into the
afternoon. Then, a second push of southeasterly winds Tuesday
night as the low itself moves close to the area before it pulls
slowly northward into the southern Bering Sea Wednesday morning.
Wind gusts with this secondary push look to peak Wednesday morning
with similar magnitude to Tuesday morning.</description>
