<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 430 PM CDT THIS
AFTERNOON FOR NORTHEASTERN BOLLINGER AND SOUTHWESTERN PERRY
COUNTIES...
At 339 PM CDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms produced heavy
rain across the warned area earlier this afternoon. Between 1 and 2
inches of rain fell with those storms. While heavy rain has moved
out of the area, flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin
shortly.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,
highways, streets and underpasses as well as other poor
drainage and low-lying areas.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Perryville, Marble Hill, Patton, Alliance, Sedgewickville, Silver
Lake and Glenallen.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
