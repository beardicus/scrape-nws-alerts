<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT...
The following message is transmitted at the request of the New Mexico
Departments of Health and Environment.
* WHAT...A significant decrease in westerly winds this afternoon in
response to high pressure aloft slowly building over the region.
This trend of diminished transport winds will continue into
Saturday. Smoke from large wildfires in the area will continue to
blow toward the east or east-southeast until around sunset.
Thereafter, smoke transport will be increasingly dominated by down-
drainage or down valley winds tonight into Saturday morning.
Limited if not poor smoke dispersion overnight into early Saturday
before daytime mixing commences with predominately west and
southwest winds in the 10 to 20 mph range expected during the
afternoon and evening. In addition to smoke, the heat will build
this weekend into early next week with record or near-record high
temperatures expected for many of the impacted communities. New
Mexicans may also need to take steps to avoid heat-related
illnesses.
* WHERE...Locations most likely to experience the greatest impacts from
smoke include areas along and near the I-25 corridor from Pecos to
Bernal to Romeroville to Las Vegas extending north to Gallinas,
Sapello, La Cueva, Mora, Chacon, Guadalupita and Ocate as well as
neighboring communities. Smoke impacts are likely to extend
farther east and southeast to include areas in and near Watrous,
Valmora, Anton Chico, Conchas and Logan. Other locations that may
experience less significant impacts include, but are not limited to,
the following communities: Fort Sumner Mosquero, Roy, Newkirk,
Santa Rosa, and Tucumcari. Smoke from the Cerro Pelado fire will
have the greatest impact along the Rio Grande Valley near White
Rock and Cochiti Pueblo extending to Pena Blanca and Kewa Pueblo.
* WHEN...Remainder of this afternoon through at least Noon MDT
Saturday, May 14th.
* IMPACTS...Those with conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and
heart disease will be especially vulnerable to impacts from poor
air quality, as will adults over age 65, young children, and
pregnant women if smoke concentrations become unhealthy.
Additionally, NMDOH offers heat safety information tips
athttps://nmtracking.org/health/heatstress/Heat.html
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to determine
if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method available at
https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/IndoorQuality.html and
https://cv.nmhealth.org
New Mexicans will also need to take steps to keep their homes cool to
avoid heat-related illnesses. NMDOH offers tips here:
