        <headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued October 26 at 9:04PM EDT until October 29 at 11:00AM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City NC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents
and strong longshore currents in the surf zone. For the Coastal
Flood Advisory, 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level
expected in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.
For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 7 to 10
feet expected in the surf zone.

* WHERE...East Carteret County.

* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, from 8 AM EDT Monday
through Monday evening. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from
10 PM Monday to 11 AM EDT Wednesday. For the High Surf
Advisory, from 10 PM Monday to 11 AM EDT Wednesday.

* IMPACTS...Up to 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in a low threat of property damage. Some roads and low
lying property including parking lots, parks, lawns, and homes
adjacent to the waterfront may experience shallow flooding,
especially around high tide. Dangerous swimming and surfing
conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip currents
can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper
water. Strong longshore currents will create dangerous
swimming conditions.
</description>
        <instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.

Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.

Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.

Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
