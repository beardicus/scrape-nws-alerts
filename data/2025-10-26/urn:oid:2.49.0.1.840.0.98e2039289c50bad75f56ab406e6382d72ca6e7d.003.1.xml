        <headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued October 26 at 9:04PM EDT until October 27 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City NC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, strong longshore
currents in the surf zone. For the High Surf Advisory, large
breaking waves of 8 to 12 feet expected in the surf zone. For
the Coastal Flood Watch, 2 to 3 feet of inundation above ground
level possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways.

* WHERE...Ocracoke Island.

* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, from 8 AM EDT Monday
through Monday evening. For the High Surf Advisory, from 10 PM
Monday to 8 PM EDT Wednesday. For the Coastal Flood Watch,
from Monday evening through Wednesday evening.

* IMPACTS...2 to 3 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.
Portions of NC-12 will likely be impacted and could become
impassable with ocean overwash, especially during high tide,
along with numerous secondary roads. Low lying property
including homes, businesses, and some critical infrastructure
may be inundated. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
beach erosion expected. Strong longshore currents will create
dangerous swimming conditions.
</description>
        <instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.

Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.

Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
