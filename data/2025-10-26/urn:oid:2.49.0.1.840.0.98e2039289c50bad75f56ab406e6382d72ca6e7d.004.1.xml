        <headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued October 26 at 9:04PM EDT until October 27 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City NC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents.
For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 8 to 13 feet
expected in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Watch, 2 to 3
feet of inundation above ground level possible in low-lying
areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.

* WHERE...Hatteras Island.

* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, from 8 AM EDT Monday
through Monday evening. For the High Surf Advisory, from 10 PM
Monday to 8 PM EDT Wednesday. For the Coastal Flood Watch,
from Monday evening through Wednesday evening.

* IMPACTS...2 to 3 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.
Portions of NC-12 will likely be impacted and could become
impassable with ocean overwash, especially during high tide,
along with numerous secondary roads. Low lying property
including homes, businesses, and some critical infrastructure
may be inundated. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
beach erosion expected. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
</description>
        <instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.

Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.

Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
