<description>...Light Snow Accumulations Possible For Elevations Above 3000 ft.
Through the Morning from Scattered Snow Showers...
A strong cold front moved through the region overnight. Much
colder air was spreading into the region from the west behind the
front, which was now located across eastern Virginia and eastern
North Carolina. The combination of cold air spreading into the
region from the northwest combined with enhanced northwest upslope
flow along the mountains near the North Carolina/Tennessee line
northward to along the West Virginia/Virginia line has resulted in
scattered snow showers this morning. Isolated snow accumulations
up to 3 inches will be possible in isolated locations such as
Beech Mountain, Whitetop, Mount Rogers and similar higher
elevations above 4000 ft. Snow accumulations of 1 to 2 inches will
be possible in areas such as Flat Top, Bluefield, Marion, Bland,
and Tazewell, with possibly an inch in locations such as Boone,
Jefferson, Independence, and Wytheville. Further east, little to
no snow is expected.
If you are planning travel through the higher elevations,
especially at or above elevations of 3000 ft. and areas west of
the Interstate 77 corridor, be prepared for occasionally snow
covered roads and reduced visibility in snow showers. Reduce
speed, leave extra distance between you and the vehicle in front
of you, and allow extra time to reach your destination.</description>
