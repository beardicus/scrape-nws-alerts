<headline>Flood Watch issued February 18 at 5:42AM EST until February 18 at 10:00AM EST by NWS Buffalo</headline>
<description>.Heavy rain combined with rapid snowmelt yesterday resulted in
excessive runoff into streams, rivers, and low lying areas. The
flood risk will continue today even as temperatures fall well below
freezing.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by heavy rain and snowmelt yesterday will
continue to be possible today, even as temperatures fall well
below freezing.
* WHERE...A portion of western New York, including the following
counties, Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Genesee, Livingston,
Monroe, Niagara, Northern Erie, Orleans, Southern Erie and Wyoming.
* WHEN...Through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff from rain and snow melt may result in
flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and
flood-prone locations. The greatest threat for flooding from ice
jams will be the Buffalo area creeks and near Sunset Bay on
Cattaraugus creek. Creeks and streams may rise out of their
banks.  Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Flood
warnings have already been issued in some areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Earlier ice breakup will continue to move on area creeks
through today, with a risk of ice jams at typically
vulnerable locations. Rain and snowmelt from yesterday will
continue to result in flooding of streams, rivers, and low
