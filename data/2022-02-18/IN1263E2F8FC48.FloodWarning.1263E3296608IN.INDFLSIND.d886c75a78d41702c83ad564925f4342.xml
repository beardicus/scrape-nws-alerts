.A combination of snow melt and rainfall from Wednesday night
through Thursday with 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain falling on saturated

with smaller streams and rivers either crested or nearly crested.
Flooding along the main stem rivers will continue to worsen through

through at least next week.  Another series of rain events are
