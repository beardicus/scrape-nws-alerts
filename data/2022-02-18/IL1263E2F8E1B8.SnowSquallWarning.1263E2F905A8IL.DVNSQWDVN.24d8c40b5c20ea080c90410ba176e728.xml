PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes

time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.
Reduce your speed and turn on your headlights! During snow squalls,
the visibility may suddenly drop to near zero in whiteout conditions.
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads, bridges
and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and be
prepared for sudden loss of traction.</description>
