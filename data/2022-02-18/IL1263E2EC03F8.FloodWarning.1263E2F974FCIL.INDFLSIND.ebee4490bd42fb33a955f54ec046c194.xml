<headline>Flood Warning issued February 18 at 12:06PM CST until further notice by NWS Indianapolis</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers and
streams in Indiana...Illinois...
Driftwood River, White River, Wabash River, Eel River, Sugar
Creek, Youngs Creek, Big Walnut Creek, Big Blue River, East Fork
White River, Flatrock River, East Fork White River, Tippecanoe
River, Wildcat Creek, Mississinewa River, Mill Creek
.A combination of snow melt and rainfall from Wednesday night
through Thursday with 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain falling on saturated
ground.  This has lead to widespread flooding across central Indiana
with many smaller streams and rivers either in flood or nearing
flood stage.  The flooding along small creeks has generally ended
with smaller streams and rivers either crested or nearly crested.
Flooding along the main stem rivers will continue to worsen through
the weekend with moderate flooding expected along portions of the
Upper Wabash River. Further downstream, flooding will continue
through at least next week.  Another series of rain events are
possible next week which would prolong and potentially exacerbate
ongoing flooding.
...FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Wabash River at Hutsonville Legacy Power Plant Site.
* WHEN...Until further notice.
* IMPACTS...At 22.8 feet, Flooding extends to what is locally called
River Road in several areas. River Road is the rural way south
from Hutsonville to Palestine.  Flooding in this area affects
large expanses of agricultural land, river cabins and hunting
areas on both sides of the river.  Most local, unimproved roads
leading towards the river are flooded.  These roads led to farms,
river cabins, private residences, levees and a few oil wells.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- There is no current observed data.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise to a crest of 22.6
feet early Thursday morning.
- Flood stage is 16.0 feet.
