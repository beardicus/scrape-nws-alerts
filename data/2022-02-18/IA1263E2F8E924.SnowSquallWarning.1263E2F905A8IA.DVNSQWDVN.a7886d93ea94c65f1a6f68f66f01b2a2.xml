<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 930 PM CST FOR ROCK
ISLAND...WHITESIDE...NORTHERN HENRY...CARROLL...SOUTHEASTERN
STEPHENSON AND EAST CENTRAL CLINTON COUNTIES...
At 856 PM CST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from near Stillman Valley to Andalusia, moving southeast at
35 mph.
HAZARD...Snow...Whiteout conditions. Zero visibility in snow.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Dangerous life-threatening travel.
This includes the following highways...
Interstate 80 in Illinois between mile markers 1 and 24.
Interstate 74 in Illinois between mile markers 2 and 23.
Interstate 88 between mile markers 1 and 44.
Interstate 280 between mile markers 11 and 18.
Locations impacted include...
Moline, Rock Island, Clinton, East Moline, Sterling, Rock Falls,
Morrison, Mount Carroll, Silvis, Geneseo, Milan, Colona, Coal Valley,
Fulton, Prophetstown, Hampton, Orion, Port Byron, Erie and Lanark.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.
There is no safe place on a highway when a snow squall hits.
Visibility and traction are immediately lost in whiteout conditions,
making it difficult or impossible to slow down and avoid stopped
vehicles. Delay travel or safely exit the highway before the snow
squall arrives.
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads, bridges
and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and be
prepared for sudden loss of traction.</description>
