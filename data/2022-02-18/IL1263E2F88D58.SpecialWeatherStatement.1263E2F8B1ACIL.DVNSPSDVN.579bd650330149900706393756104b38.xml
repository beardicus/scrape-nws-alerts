southeast at 35 mph.
HAZARD...Snow and wind gusts up to 50 mph
SOURCE...Radar...Observations and Cameras
IMPACTS...Ice covered surfaces including roadways, bridges,

This includes Interstate 380 between mile markers 49 and 55.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Use extra caution if you must travel into or through this snow

your location.
A rapid drop in temperatures will lead to the rapid formation of
black ice on area roadways. Black ice is nearly impossible to see and
roadways may appear wet. Please use extreme caution, especially on
bridges, overpasses and around curves. Allow plenty of stopping
distance and avoid braking suddenly.</description>
