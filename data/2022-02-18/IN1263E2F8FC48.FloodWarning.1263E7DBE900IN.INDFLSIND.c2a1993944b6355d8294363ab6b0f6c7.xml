.A combination of snow melt and rainfall from Wednesday night
through Thursday with 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain falling on saturated
ground.  This has lead to widespread flooding across central Indiana
with many smaller streams and rivers either in flood or nearing
flood stage.  The flooding along small creeks has generally ended
with smaller streams and rivers either crested or nearly crested.
Flooding along the main stem rivers will continue to worsen through
the weekend with moderate flooding expected along portions of the
Upper Wabash River. Further downstream, flooding will continue
through at least next week.  Another series of rain events are
possible next week which would prolong and potentially exacerbate
ongoing flooding.
