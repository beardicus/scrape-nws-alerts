WASHINGTON AND MUSCATINE COUNTIES...
At 902 PM CST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from Walcott to 6 miles north of Ainsworth, moving
southeast at 35 mph.
HAZARD...Extremely poor visibility snow and blowing snow. Wind gusts
greater than 30 mph.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Dangerous life-threatening travel.
This includes Interstate 80 in Iowa between mile markers 264 and 272.
Locations impacted include...
Muscatine, Aledo, Wapello, Columbus Junction, West Liberty, Wilton,
Lone Tree, Winfield, Riverside, Fruitland, Viola, Millersburg,
Matherville, Hills, New Boston, Sherrard, Ainsworth, Grandview,
Reynolds and Conesville.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.
Reduce your speed and turn on headlights! During snow squalls, the
visibility may suddenly drop to near zero in whiteout conditions.
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads, bridges
and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and be
prepared for sudden loss of traction.</description>
