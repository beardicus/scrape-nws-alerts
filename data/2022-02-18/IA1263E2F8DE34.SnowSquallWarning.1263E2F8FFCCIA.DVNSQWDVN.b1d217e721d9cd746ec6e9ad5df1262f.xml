<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 915 PM CST FOR
EASTERN CEDAR...SCOTT...NORTHEASTERN MUSCATINE AND CLINTON
COUNTIES...
At 828 PM CST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from near Clinton to near Durant, moving southeast at 30
mph.
HAZARD...Whiteout conditions. Zero visibility in snow and blowing
snow. Wind gusts greater than 40 mph.
SOURCE...Radar indicated and Spotter Reports.
IMPACT...Dangerous life-threatening travel.
This includes the following highways...
Interstate 74 in Iowa between mile markers 1 and 4.
Interstate 80 in Iowa between mile markers 271 and 306.
Interstate 280 between mile markers 1 and 9.
Locations impacted include...
Davenport, Rock Island, Bettendorf, Clinton, Durant, Eldridge,
DeWitt, Camanche, Le Claire, Fulton, Wilton, Walcott, Blue Grass,
Buffalo, Albany, Princeton, Long Grove, Lowden, Wheatland and
Cordova.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.
If traveling on a highway, find the nearest exit or rest area and
park safely away from traffic. Allow snow squalls to pass before
attempting to resume travel.
There is no safe place on a highway when a snow squall hits.
Visibility and traction are immediately lost in whiteout conditions,
making it difficult or impossible to slow down and avoid stopped
vehicles. Delay travel or safely exit the highway before the snow
squall arrives.
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads, bridges
and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and be
prepared for sudden loss of traction.</description>
