HAZARD...Extremely poor visibility in heavy snow and blowing snow.
Wind gusts greater than 30 mph.

This includes US Highway 2 from near Odanah to Hurley and Wisconsin

Reduce your speed and turn on headlights! During snow squalls, the
visibility may suddenly drop to near zero in whiteout conditions.</description>
