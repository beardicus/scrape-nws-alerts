<description>...LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND NEAR GALE-FORCE GUSTS POSSIBLE DUE TO
PASSING TROPICAL DISTURBANCE THROUGH MONDAY...
A tropical disturbance, known as Invest 96W, is located to the
southeast of the Marianas and slowly moving west, expected to pass
just south of Guam in the next few days. 96W and a corresponding
surface trough over the area are expected to bring numerous locally
heavy showers and isolated thunderstorms Sunday and Sunday night.
Rainfall: Training cells can bring rain amounts between 2 and 4 inches, with
locally heavier amounts in excess of 4 to 6 inches possible as
indicated by the GFS ensemble probability trends. While soil moisture
has been decreasing since the last major rain event, some areas may
continue to be under risk of additional rainfall becoming run-off
quickly. Localized flooding is possible in low-lying and poor
drainage areas. If living near streams and rivers, prepare to move
items away from stream and river banks. Make sure storm drains nearby
are not clogged, especially in low-lying areas.
Winds: East winds of 10 to 15 mph are expected to shift to the
southwest tonight, becoming 15 to 25 mph after midnight, with
occasional gusts to 35 mph on Sunday. Winds will diminish slightly
Sunday night, before becoming more southerly and moderate starting
Monday.
Seas: Combined seas of around 4 feet are expected to quickly increase
to between 5 and 8 feet Saturday night into Sunday as winds shift and
increase. The seas will start to subside quickly starting Monday.
Folks in the Marianas should keep up-to-date with the latest
statements and advisories from the National Weather Service and your
local emergency management offices. Forecast products issued by the
National Weather Service are posted on the WFO Guam web page at
