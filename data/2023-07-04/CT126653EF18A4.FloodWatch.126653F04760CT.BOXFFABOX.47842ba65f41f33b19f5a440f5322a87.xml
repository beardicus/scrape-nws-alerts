<headline>Flood Watch issued July 04 at 10:25AM EDT until July 04 at 6:00PM EDT by NWS Boston</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of northern Connecticut, including the following
areas, Hartford CT, Tolland CT and Windham CT. Portions of
Massachusetts, including the following areas, Central Middlesex
MA, Eastern Franklin MA, Eastern Hampden MA, Eastern Hampshire MA,
Northern Bristol MA, Northern Middlesex MA, Northern Worcester MA,
Southern Worcester MA and Western Norfolk MA. Portions of northern
Rhode Island, including the following areas, Northwest Providence
RI and Southeast Providence RI.
* WHEN...Through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- More rounds of showers and thunderstorms are expected later
this morning into the afternoon and evening. Any
thunderstorms have the potential to produce rainfall rates of
1 to 2 inches per hour which will elevate the risk of urban
and street flooding along with localized flash flooding. The
greatest risk for storms will be along and south of the Mass
Pike.
Excessive runoff will also result in rises on streams, creeks
and tributaries to potentially over bankfull.
