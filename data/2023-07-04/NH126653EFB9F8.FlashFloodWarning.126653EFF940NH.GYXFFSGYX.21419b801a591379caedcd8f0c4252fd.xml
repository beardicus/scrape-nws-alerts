<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM EDT THIS
AFTERNOON FOR NORTHEASTERN BELKNAP AND SOUTHEASTERN CARROLL
COUNTIES...
At 238 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain fell across the
warned area earlier this afternoon. Between 1 and 3 inches of rain
fell. Small streams and brooks have responded and are running high.
Though the rain has moved out of the area, flooding is still
possible.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by heavy rain.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,
as well as other poor drainage and low-lying areas.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Ossipee, Moultonborough, Alton, Effingham, Wolfeboro, Brookfield,
Tuftonboro, Wakefield and New Durham.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
EXPECTED RAINFALL RATE...2-3 INCHES IN 1 HOUR</description>
<instruction>In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
