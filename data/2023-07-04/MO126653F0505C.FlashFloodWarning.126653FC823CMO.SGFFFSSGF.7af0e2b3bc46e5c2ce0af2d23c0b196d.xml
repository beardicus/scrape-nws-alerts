<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 915 PM CDT THIS
EVENING FOR SOUTHEASTERN DALLAS COUNTY...
At 523 PM CDT, Doppler radar indicated that thunderstorms have ended
across the warned area. However, runoff will likely continue to
cause flash flooding along smaller creeks and streams in the warned
area through early evening.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, streets and
underpasses as well as other poor drainage and low-lying
areas.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Conway and Long Lane.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers during and immediately after heavy rains. Campers and hikers
should avoid streams or creeks.</instruction>
