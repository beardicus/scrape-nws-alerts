<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 AM PDT
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Minor coastal flooding expected as we experience a summer
King Tide event now into the early morning hours of Wednesday.
The peak high tides will occur late at night between 11 pm to 1
am each night and this is when the flooding of low lying spots
is likely to occur on the Bay-side of North Bay counties.
* WHERE...Bayside coasts of Marin, Sonoma, and Napa counties.
* WHEN...Until 3 AM PDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The greatest risk for minor flooding is
during high tide cycles between 10 PM and 2 AM each night. Lower
than normal low tides will occur between 5 and 8 AM each
morning. These impacts are most likely within bayside portions
of Marin County and for low lying portions of the Delta.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
