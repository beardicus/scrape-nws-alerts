<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 445 PM MST FOR SOUTH
CENTRAL POWELL COUNTY...
At 429 PM MST, a dangerous snow squall was located 9 miles west of
Whitehall, or 11 miles southeast of Butte, moving southeast at 35
mph.
HAZARD...Flash freeze on roads. Intense bursts of heavy snow and
gusty winds leading to blowing snow and rapidly falling
visibility. Wind gusts greater than 35 mph.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Dangerous and life-threatening travel conditions are
expected to develop rapidly in the warning area.
This includes Interstate 90 between mile markers 180 and 190.
Locations impacted include...
Deer Lodge.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads,
bridges, and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and
be prepared for a sudden loss of traction.
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.</description>
