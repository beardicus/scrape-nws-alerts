<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 415 PM MST FOR
SOUTHEASTERN POWELL COUNTY...
At 339 PM MST, a dangerous snow squall was located 12 miles southwest
of Helena, moving southeast at 25 mph.
HAZARD...Flash freeze on roads. Whiteout conditions with near zero
visibility associated with intense bursts of heavy snow and
gusty winds leading to blowing snow. Wind gusts greater
than 50 mph could knock down tree limbs and blow around
unsecured objects.
SOURCE...Radar and webcams.
IMPACT...Dangerous and life-threatening travel conditions are
expected to develop rapidly in the warning area.
This includes Highway 12 Garrison to MacDonald Pass between mile
markers 13 and 26.
Locations impacted include...
Elliston and Avon.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads,
bridges, and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and
be prepared for a sudden loss of traction.
Slow Down! Rapid changes in visibility and road conditions are
expected with this dangerous snow squall. Be alert for sudden
whiteout conditions.
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.</description>
