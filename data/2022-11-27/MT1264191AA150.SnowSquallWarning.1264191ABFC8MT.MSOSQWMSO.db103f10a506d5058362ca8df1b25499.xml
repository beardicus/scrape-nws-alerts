<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 230 PM MST FOR EAST
CENTRAL FLATHEAD COUNTY...
At 152 PM MST, a dangerous snow squall was located 9 miles southwest
of Kiowa, or 39 miles east of Evergreen, moving east at 30 mph.
HAZARD...Flash freeze on roads. Intense bursts of heavy snow and
gusty winds leading to blowing snow and visibility rapidly
falling to less than one-quarter mile. Wind gusts up to 35
mph.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Travel will become difficult and potentially dangerous
within minutes.
This includes Highway 2 between mile markers 169 and 196.
Locations impacted include...
Pinnacle, Blacktail and Essex.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads,
bridges, and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and
be prepared for a sudden loss of traction.
Slow Down! Rapid changes in visibility and road conditions are
expected with this dangerous snow squall. Be alert for sudden
whiteout conditions.
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.</description>
