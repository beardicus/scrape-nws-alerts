<description>The National Weather Service in Missoula has issued a
* Snow Squall Warning for...
Southeastern Powell County in west central Montana...
* Until 415 PM MST.
* At 314 PM MST, a dangerous snow squall was located 18 miles east of
Garrison, or 20 miles northeast of Deer Lodge, moving southeast at
25 mph.
HAZARD...Flash freeze on roads. Whiteout conditions with near zero
visibility associated with intense bursts of heavy snow
and gusty winds leading to blowing snow. Wind gusts
greater than 50 mph could knock down tree limbs and blow
around unsecured objects.

expected to develop rapidly in the warning area.
This includes Highway 12 Garrison to MacDonald Pass between mile
markers 10 and 26.
Locations impacted include...
Elliston and Avon.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads,
bridges, and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and
be prepared for a sudden loss of traction.
Slow Down! Rapid changes in visibility and road conditions are
expected with this dangerous snow squall. Be alert for sudden
whiteout conditions.
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.</description>
