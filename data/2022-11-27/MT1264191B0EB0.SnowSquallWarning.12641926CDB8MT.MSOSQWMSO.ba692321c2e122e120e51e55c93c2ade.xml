<headline>Snow Squall Warning issued November 27 at 4:32PM MST until November 27 at 5:30PM MST by NWS Missoula</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Missoula has issued a
* Snow Squall Warning for...
Central Deer Lodge County in west central Montana...
Silver Bow County in west central Montana...
* Until 530 PM MST.
* At 432 PM MST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from 6 miles north of Walkerville to 15 miles south of
Anaconda, moving southeast at 25 mph.
HAZARD...Flash freeze on roads. Whiteout conditions with near zero
visibility associated with intense bursts of heavy snow
and gusty winds leading to blowing snow. Wind gusts
greater than 35 mph.
SOURCE...Radar and trained spotter.
IMPACT...Dangerous and life-threatening travel conditions are
expected to develop rapidly in the warning area.
This includes Interstate 90 between mile markers 208 and 231.
Locations impacted include...
Butte, Silver Bow, Walkerville, Divide, Gregson Hot Springs, Nissler,
Crackerville, Ramsay, Janney, Newcomb and Dewey.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads,
bridges, and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and
be prepared for a sudden loss of traction.
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.
Serious injuries and deaths may result from people exiting their
vehicles during a snow squall. Drivers may not be able to see you or
to stop! If stopped on the roadway or involved in an accident,
quickly exit your vehicle move as far away from the roadway as
possible ONLY when it is safe to do so. Do not stand along or near
the roadway, since approaching vehicles may be unable to maintain
control.</description>
