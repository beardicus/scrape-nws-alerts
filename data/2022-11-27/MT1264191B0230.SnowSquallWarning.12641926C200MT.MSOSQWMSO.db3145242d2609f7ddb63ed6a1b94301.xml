<headline>Snow Squall Warning issued November 27 at 4:00PM MST until November 27 at 5:00PM MST by NWS Missoula</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Missoula has issued a
* Snow Squall Warning for...
Northeastern Deer Lodge County in west central Montana...
North central Silver Bow County in west central Montana...
South central Powell County in west central Montana...
* Until 500 PM MST.
* At 400 PM MST, a dangerous snow squall was located over Warm
Springs, or 10 miles east of Anaconda, moving south at 20 mph.
HAZARD...Flash freeze on roads. Intense bursts of heavy snow and
gusty winds leading to blowing snow and rapidly falling
visibility. Wind gusts greater than 50 mph could knock
down tree limbs and blow around unsecured objects.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Dangerous and life-threatening travel conditions are
expected to develop rapidly in the warning area.
This includes Interstate 90 between mile markers 192 and 208.
Locations impacted include...
Anaconda, West Valley, Warm Springs, Galen, Lost Creek, Opportunity
and Racetrack.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads,
bridges, and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and
be prepared for a sudden loss of traction.
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.</description>
