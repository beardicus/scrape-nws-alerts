<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued November 27 at 3:03AM AKST until November 28 at 4:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM NOON SUNDAY TO 4 AM
AKST MONDAY FOR THE KUSKOKWIM DELTA COAST AND NUNIVAK ISLAND...
* WHAT...Blowing snow expected. Total snow accumulations of up to
3 inches. Northeast winds gusting as high as 30 mph. Visibility
as low as one half mile.
* WHERE...Kuskokwim Delta coast and Nunivak Island.
* WHEN...From noon Sunday to 4 AM AKST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Expect difficult travel conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The strongest winds and most likely low
visibility conditions will occur for Mekoryuk and Toksook Bay
midday Sunday into Sunday night. Winds are expected to be weaker
further south, which may lead to more intermittent periods of
reduced visibility. There is some uncertainty with how long
snowfall will persist in the region and whether it will taper
off Sunday evening or linger into the day on Monday. This may
lead to either a shorter or more prolonged period of blowing
snow, especially along the Kuskokwim Delta coast, before
visibility improves.</description>
