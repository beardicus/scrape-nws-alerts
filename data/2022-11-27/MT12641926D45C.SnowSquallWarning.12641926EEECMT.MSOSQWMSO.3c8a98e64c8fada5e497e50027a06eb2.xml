<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 615 PM MST FOR
SOUTHERN SILVER BOW COUNTY...
At 546 PM MST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from 10 miles east of Butte to 13 miles west of Divide,
moving southeast at 15 mph.
HAZARD...Flash freeze on roads. Intense bursts of heavy snow and
gusty winds leading to blowing snow and rapidly falling
visibility. Wind gusts greater than 35 mph.
SOURCE...Radar and trained spotter.
IMPACT...Travel will become difficult and potentially dangerous
within minutes.
This includes Interstate 90 between mile markers 228 and 231.
Locations impacted include...
Butte, Divide, Janney and Newcomb.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads,
bridges, and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and
be prepared for a sudden loss of traction.
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.</description>
