<headline>Flood Advisory issued June 21 at 2:15PM EDT until June 24 at 11:45PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Nuisance flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
expected.  The Little River is causing flooding at Little River
Park in Laurens.
* WHERE...Central and eastern Laurens County, South Carolina
* WHEN...Until 700 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks,
greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and
parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.
A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 208 PM EDT, Area soils are saturated from heavy rainfall
on Tuesday and streamflows are elevated from excessive runoff
across Laurens County.  Since early this morning, numerous
rounds of showers have been moving through Laurens County,
producing another 0.50-2 inches of rain.  This is in addition
to the 2-5 inches of rainfall that fell across Laurens County
last night.
Embedded areas of heavy rain are developing as a more
unstable air mass enters the region.  These heavier showers
will be very efficient rainfall producers and some areas may
receive an additional 1-2 inches in a short period of time as
they train over portions of Laurens County.  This may cause
new rises on area streams and new areas of nuisance to Minor
flooding may develop through the afternoon hours.
The Little River in Laurens is currently flooding portions of
Little River Park.  The USGS streamgauge at Little River Park
is currently at 7.17 feet and rising steadily.  The Little
River will continue to rise slowly during the afternoon and
may approach 9 feet again later this afternoon.  This will
produce Minor flooding at Little River Park similar to last
night.  More significant flooding is possible if more
widespread heavy rain develops.
- Several rounds of showers and thunderstorms are expected to
develop through the day and additional activity is expected
on Thursday.  These showers and storms will be very efficient
at producing heavy rainfall.  Soils are saturated and streams
are swollen.  Therefore, additional heavy rain will quickly
create new areas of flooding and cause previous areas of
flooding to redevelop. Caution is advised near any stream or
other vulnerable area.  Seek higher ground immediately when
heavy rain develops.  Flash Flood Warnings may be issued
tonight into tomorrow morning.  Please have a plan in place
should flash flooding develop and do not hesitate to act.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Laurens, Clinton, Fountain Inn, Joanna, Gray Court, Cross
Hill, Waterloo, Mountville, Ora, Hickory Tavern, Kinards and
Princeton.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Obey all barricades, even if no water is over the roadway.
Barricaded roads may have been compromised by earlier high flows and
flooding and may not be safe for travel.</instruction>
