<headline>Flood Advisory issued June 21 at 2:43PM EDT until June 26 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 830 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Nuisance flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
expected.  High flows are ongoing along Wilson Creek with isolated
flooding possible.
* WHERE...Central and western Greenwood County.
* WHEN...Until 830 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks,
greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and
parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.
A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 242 PM EDT, Area soils are saturated from heavy rainfall
on Tuesday and streamflows are elevated from excessive runoff
across Greenwood County.  Since early this morning, numerous
rounds of showers have been moving through Greenwood County,
producing another 0.50-2 inches of rain.  This is in addition
to the 2-5 inches of rainfall that fell across the county
last night.
Periods of heavy rain are developing as a more unstable air
mass enters the region.  These heavier showers will be very
efficient rainfall producers and some areas may receive an
additional 1-2 inches in a short period of time as they train
over portions of Greenwood County.  This may cause new rises
on area streams and new areas of nuisance to Minor flooding
may develop through the afternoon hours.
- Several rounds of showers and thunderstorms are expected to
develop through the day and additional activity is expected
on Thursday.  These showers and storms will be very efficient
at producing heavy rainfall.  Soils are saturated and streams
are swollen.  Therefore, additional heavy rain will quickly
create new areas of flooding and cause previous areas of
flooding to redevelop. Caution is advised near any stream or
other vulnerable area.  Seek higher ground immediately when
heavy rain develops.  Flash Flood Warnings may be issued
tonight into tomorrow morning.  Please have a plan in place
should flash flooding develop and do not hesitate to act.
- Some locations that may experience flooding
include...Greenwood, Ninety Six, Cokesbury, Troy, Ninety Six
Historic Site, Greenwood State Park, Promised Land, Bradley,
Coronaca, Epworth, Kirksey, Callison and Dyson.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Obey all barricades, even if no water is over the roadway.
Barricaded roads may have been compromised by earlier high flows and
flooding and may not be safe for travel.</instruction>
