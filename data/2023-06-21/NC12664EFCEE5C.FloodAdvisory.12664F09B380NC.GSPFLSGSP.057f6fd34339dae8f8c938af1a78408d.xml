<headline>Flood Advisory issued June 21 at 12:31PM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
within the N Second Creek watershed from Mount Ulla to Woodleaf.
* WHERE...Portions of western Rowan County, North Carolina.
* WHEN...Until 800 PM EDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks,
boat-access areas, golf courses, low-water crossings, and
low-lying roadways.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1222 PM EDT, High flows continue on N Second Creek and
will continue through the day today following several rounds
of heavy rainfall since Monday night.  Areas of the upper
watershed have received 4-7 inches of rainfall since Monday.
The following streamgauge is above Action/Advisory Stage,
resulting in nuisance flooding along North Second Creek...
ID: BRBN7
NAME: above Statesville Blvd (US 70), 4 mi S of Woodleaf
CURRENT STAGE: 12.61 feet
TREND: Rising Slowly
ACTION/ADVISORY STAGE: 12.00 feet
MINOR FLOOD STAGE: 14.00 feet
ESTIMATED FORECAST: N Second Creek will continue to rise
slowly through this afternoon before cresting below 13 feet
later today.  However, additional heavy rainfall may cause N
Second Creek to start rising again and more significant
flooding cannot be ruled out, especially on Thursday.
IMPACTS: At 12 feet, N Second Creek is out of its banks up
and downstream of the gauge site on US 70, flooding adjacent
farmland and other low-lying areas. In fast-response
situations, upstream tributaries will likely already be
flooding several low-water crossings.  Impacted crossings
upstream may include at White Rd, Lyerly Rd, Upright Rd,
Graham Rd, Hall Rd, Childers Rd, and Bear Poplar Rd.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Mooresville, Mount Ulla, and Woodleaf.</description>
