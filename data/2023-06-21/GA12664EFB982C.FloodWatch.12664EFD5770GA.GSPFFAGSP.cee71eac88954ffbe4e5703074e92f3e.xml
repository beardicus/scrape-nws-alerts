<headline>Flood Watch issued June 21 at 3:55AM EDT until June 21 at 3:00PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of northeast Georgia and upstate South Carolina,
including the following counties, in northeast Georgia, Elbert. In
upstate South Carolina, Abbeville, Greenwood and Laurens.
* WHEN...Through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A low pressure system remains near the southern Appalachians
today, keeping a plume of deep moisture in place over the
region. Numerous rounds of showers will continue to move over
the area today, and likely continue tonight into Thursday,
with periods of heavy rainfall expected. An additional 2 to 3
inches of rain will be possible over the Piedmont of Upstate
South Carolina and northeast Georgia through Thursday, much
of this falling on areas that have already received several
inches of rain over the past 48 hours. This will likely cause
new flash flooding to develop.

<instruction>A Flood Watch for flash flooding means there is a potential for
rapid onset flooding based on current forecasts. Flash flooding is a
very dangerous situation and may impact areas that do not typically
flood. Please monitor the latest forecasts and be prepared to take
action quickly should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.
Low-lying areas adjacent to streams, including campgrounds, are
especially vulnerable to flooding. If you live or are vacationing
next to a stream, please have a plan in place to seek higher ground
once heavy rainfall develops. Flash floods can occur quickly and
overwhelm adjacent low-lying areas with little warning. Once the
stream starts to rise, you may only have minutes to evacuate. Flash
floods can cause catastrophic damage and be powerful enough to sweep
away campers, vehicles, and mobile homes. Consider temporarily
relocating away from streams until the heavy rainfall threat passes.</instruction>
