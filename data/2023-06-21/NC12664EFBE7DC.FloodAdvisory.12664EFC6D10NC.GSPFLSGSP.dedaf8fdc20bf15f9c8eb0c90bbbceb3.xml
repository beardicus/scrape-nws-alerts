<headline>Flood Advisory issued June 21 at 5:59AM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM EDT THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...A portion of piedmont North Carolina, including the
following county, Cabarrus.
* WHEN...Until 900 AM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, greenways,
parks, boat-access areas, golf courses, low-water crossings, and
low-lying roadways.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 556 AM EDT, Irish Buffalo Creek and Rocky River remain
elevated following earlier torrential rainfall, which
produced 2-4 inches of rainfall in 2-3 hours across northern
Cabarrus County and southern Rowan County.  Storm-total
rainfall since Monday has reached 4-6 inches with isolated
totals approaching 7 inches in this area.  This has caused
Irish Buffalo Creek and Rocky River to exceed Action/Advisory
Stage, causing nuisance to minor flooding of adjacent low-
lying areas.
The streamgauge near Irish Buffalo Creek near Georgeville
remains in Action Stage at a stage of 14.65ft.  It has
crested and is steadily falling, and should continue to fall
through this morning.
- Some locations that may continue to experience flooding
include...
Kannapolis, Downtown Concord, West Concord, Harrisburg, and
Enochville.
