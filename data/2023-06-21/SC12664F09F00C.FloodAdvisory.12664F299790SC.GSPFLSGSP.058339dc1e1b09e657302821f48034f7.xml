<headline>Flood Advisory issued June 21 at 9:55PM EDT until June 24 at 5:00AM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 945 AM EDT THURSDAY...
...REPLACES FLOOD WARNING...
* WHAT...Nuisance flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
expected.  The Little River is causing flooding at Little River
Park in Laurens.
* WHERE...A portion of upstate South Carolina, including the
following county, Laurens.
* WHEN...Until 945 AM EDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks,
greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, secondary roadways,
underpasses, and parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over
roadways is possible.  A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may
be impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 942 PM EDT, Streams across Laurens County remain elevated
due to multiple rounds of heavy rain which began Wednesday
evening.  Much of Laurens County received 3-6 inches of rain
over the past 24 hours, with Doppler radar estimating 6-8
inches of rain for isolated locations between Gray Court and
Waterloo.  The resultant floodwave is starting to leave the
headwater locations, including the Little River in Laurens,
and work downstream.  High flows has caused flooding of
adjacent low-lying areas across the county, including some
low-lying roadways.  It will take several more hours for
streams to crest and recede back below bankfull.  Therefore,
the Flood Advisory will be issued to replace the previous
Flood Warning for residual nuisance flooding overnight.
- The following streamgauge is above Action/Advisory Stage,
resulting in nuisance flooding along Little River...
ID: LRLS1
NAME: at Gordon St, in Laurens
CURRENT STAGE: 9.25 feet
CREST: 9.39 feet on June 21 at 7:00 PM
TREND: Falling Steadily
ESTIMATED FORECAST: The Little River will gradually recede
tonight and fall below bankfull later overnight or early
tomorrow morning.
IMPACTS: The Little River is causing nuisance flooding of
Little River Park, impacting the Little River Greenway and
adjacent low-lying park property.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Laurens, Clinton, Joanna, Gray Court, Cross Hill, Waterloo,
Mountville, Ora, Enoree and Kinards.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.
Obey all barricades, even if no water is over the roadway.
Barricaded roads may have been compromised by earlier high flows and
flooding and may not be safe for travel.</instruction>
