<headline>Flood Watch issued June 21 at 11:48AM EDT  by NWS Columbia</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of east central Georgia and central South
Carolina, including the following areas, in east central Georgia,
Burke, Columbia, Lincoln, McDuffie and Richmond. In central South
Carolina, Aiken, Bamberg, Barnwell, Calhoun, Central Orangeburg,
Edgefield, Lexington, McCormick, Newberry, Northwestern
Orangeburg, Richland and Saluda.
* WHEN...Through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A deep area of low pressure over Georgia today will move very
little over the next 24 to 36 hours. This will keep a deep
plume of moisture in place across the region. In addition, a
nearly stationary frontal boundary near the area will
potentially enhance shower and thunderstorm activity this
afternoon and tonight. Much of the region has already
received 2 to 4 inches of rainfall with some locally higher
amounts over the past 48 hours. With soils already saturated
along with the threat for additional heavy rainfall the watch
will continue. Additional rainfall amounts from 1 to 3 inches
will be possible in the Central Savannah River Area into the
southern Midlands and Piedmont of South Carolina.
