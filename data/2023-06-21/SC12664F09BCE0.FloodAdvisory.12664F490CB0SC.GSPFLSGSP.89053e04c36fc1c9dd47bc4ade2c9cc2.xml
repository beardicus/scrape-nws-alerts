<headline>Flood Advisory issued June 21 at 8:24PM EDT until June 26 at 11:16AM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 AM EDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Nuisance flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
expected.  High flows are ongoing along Wilson Creek with isolated
lowland flooding possible.
* WHERE...Greenwood County, South Carolina
* WHEN...Until 200 AM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks,
greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, secondary roadways,
underpasses, and parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over
roadways is possible.  A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may
become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 807 PM EDT, A line of showers and storms is currently
moving through Greenwood County and is producing a brief
period of moderate to heavy rainfall, especially across the
eastern third of the county.  This is producing a quick
0.50-1.50 inches of rainfall on top of 2-5&quot; of rain which has
fallen since Wednesday evening.  These heavier showers and
storms will move north of the county by 10 PM and only light
rain is expected thereafter.  However, continued high stream
levels will persist into the late evening hours and it will
take a while longer for areas of lowland flooding to improve
across the county.  Therefore the Flood Advisory will
continue to allow streams to recede below critical levels.
- Additional rounds of showers and thunderstorms are expected
to develop on Thursday.  These showers and storms will be
very efficient at producing heavy rainfall.  Soils are
saturated and streams are swollen.  Therefore, additional
heavy rain may quickly create new areas of flooding and cause
previous areas of flooding to redevelop.  As a result, Flash
Flood Warnings may be issued during the day on Thursday.
Caution is advised near any stream or other vulnerable area.
Seek higher ground immediately if heavy rain develops.
Please have a plan in place should flash flooding develop and
do not hesitate to act.
- Some locations that may experience flooding
include...Greenwood, Ninety Six, Cokesbury, Troy, Ninety Six
Historic Site, Greenwood State Park, Promised Land, Bradley,
Coronaca, Epworth, Kirksey, Callison and Dyson.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Obey all barricades, even if no water is over the roadway.
Barricaded roads may have been compromised by earlier high flows and
flooding and may not be safe for travel.</instruction>
