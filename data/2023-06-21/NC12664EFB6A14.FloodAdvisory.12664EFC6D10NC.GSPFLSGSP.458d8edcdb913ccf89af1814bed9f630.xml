<headline>Flood Advisory issued June 21 at 2:37AM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 830 AM EDT THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Small stream flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
expected.
* WHERE...A portion of western North Carolina in Henderson County.
* WHEN...Until 830 AM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
Some low-water crossings may become impassable, and locations
along small streams will become inundated.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 233 AM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated heavy rain due to thunderstorms. This is causing
small stream flooding. Between 1 and 2 inches of rain have
fallen.
- At 230 AM EDT, stream gauges along Mud Creek were reporting
rapid rises in river stage, with the headwaters in particular
rapidly approaching action stage.  Locations along Mud Creek
are therefore expected to exceed bankfull conditions
imminently.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Hendersonville, Flat Rock, Mountain Home, Laurel Park, Valley
Hill, East Flat Rock, Dana and Crab Creek.
