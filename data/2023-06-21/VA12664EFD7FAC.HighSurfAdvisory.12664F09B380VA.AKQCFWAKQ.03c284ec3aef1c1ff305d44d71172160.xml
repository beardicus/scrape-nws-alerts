<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY
EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 8
to 10 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards Statement,
rough surf conditions and a high risk of rip currents expected.
* WHERE...Northampton County.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, through Thursday
evening. For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT this
evening.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
