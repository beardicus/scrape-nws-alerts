<headline>Flood Watch issued June 21 at 11:02PM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of piedmont North Carolina and western North
Carolina, including the following areas, in piedmont North
Carolina, Alexander. In western North Carolina, Avery, Buncombe,
Burke Mountains, Caldwell Mountains, Eastern McDowell, Eastern
Polk, Greater Burke, Greater Caldwell, Greater Rutherford,
Henderson, McDowell Mountains, Mitchell, Polk Mountains,
Rutherford Mountains and Yancey.
* WHEN...Through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A low pressure system remains near the southern Appalachians,
keeping a plume of deep moisture in place over the region.
Numerous rounds of showers will continue to move over the
area overnight and into Thursday, with periods of heavy
rainfall possible. An additional 1 to 2 inches of rain will
be possible over the area, with the highest amounts along and
just east of the northern Blue Ridge mountains. This rain
will fall on areas that have already received several inches
of rain over the past couple of days. This may cause new
flash flooding to develop. As such, the risk of landslides
will be heightened.

<instruction>A Flood Watch for flash flooding means there is a potential for
rapid onset flooding based on current forecasts. Flash flooding is a
very dangerous situation and may impact areas that do not typically
flood. Please monitor the latest forecasts and be prepared to take
action quickly should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.
Rainfall of more than five inches in similar storms has been
associated with an increased risk of landslides and rockslides. If
you live on a mountainside or in a cove at the base of a mountain,
especially near a stream, be ready to leave in advance of the storm
or as quickly as possible should rising water, moving earth, or
rocks threaten. Consider postponing travel along mountain roads
during periods of heavy rainfall.
Low-lying areas adjacent to streams, including campgrounds, are
especially vulnerable to flooding. If you live or are vacationing
next to a stream, please have a plan in place to seek higher ground
once heavy rainfall develops. Flash floods can occur quickly and
overwhelm adjacent low-lying areas with little warning. Once the
stream starts to rise, you may only have minutes to evacuate. Flash
floods can cause catastrophic damage and be powerful enough to sweep
away campers, vehicles, and mobile homes. Consider temporarily
relocating away from streams until the heavy rainfall threat passes.</instruction>
