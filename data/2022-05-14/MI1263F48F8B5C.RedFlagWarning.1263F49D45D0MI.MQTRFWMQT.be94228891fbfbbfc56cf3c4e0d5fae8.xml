strong winds, low relative humidity, and warm temperatures and
exceptionally dry fuels will create dangerous wildland fire
conditions. Campfires, outdoor grills, smoking materials, chain
saws, and all-terrain vehicles all have the potential to throw a
spark and ignite a dangerous and destructive fire.

field of this Red Flag Warning.</instruction>
