<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT...
The following message is transmitted at the request of the New Mexico
Departments of Health and Environment.
* WHAT...Hot, dry and unstable conditions with light winds will
persist across the area. Light transport winds will continue into
Sunday with smoke from large wildfires continuing to blow toward the
east or east-southeast until around sunset. Thereafter, smoke
transport will be increasingly dominated by down-drainage or down
valley winds tonight into Sunday morning. Limited, if not poor,
smoke dispersion is expected overnight into early Sunday before
daytime mixing is expected. In addition to smoke impacts, above
average temperatures will continue through Sunday. New Mexicans may
also need to take steps to avoid heat-related illnesses.
* WHERE...Locations most likely to experience the greatest impacts
from smoke include San Miguel and Mora counties. Smoke could affect
areas along and near the I-25 corridor from San Jose to Las Vegas
extending north toward Springer.
* WHEN...Remainder of this afternoon through at least Noon MDT
Sunday, May 15th.
* IMPACTS...Those with conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and heart
disease will be especially vulnerable to impacts from poor air
quality, as will adults over age 65, young children, and pregnant
women if smoke concentrations become unhealthy.
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method available
at https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/IndoorQuality.html and
https://cv.nmhealth.org
New Mexicans will also need to take steps to keep their homes cool to
avoid heat-related illnesses. NMDOH offers tips here:
