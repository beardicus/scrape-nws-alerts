<description>...AIR QUALITY HEALTH ADVISORY FOR WILDFIRE SMOKE FROM 900 AM
SATURDAY UNTIL 900 AM SUNDAY...
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has
issued the following...
WHAT...Air Quality Health Advisory for Wildfire Smoke.
WHERE...Teller County. Locations include, but are not limited to,
Cripple Creek, Victor, Florissant, Divide, and Woodland Park.
WHEN...900 AM Saturday May 14 to 900 AM Sunday May 15
IMPACTS...Smoke from the High Park wildfire will affect the
advisory area through Saturday and into Sunday morning. Winds will
mainly come from the south or southwest on Saturday, shifting to
come from the northwest Saturday evening. Winds may be breezy to
strong at times and may increase fire behavior and smoke
production. The greatest impacts from smoke are expected in
downwind areas in the immediate vicinity of the fire, and during
overnight hours along the Fourmile Creek drainage in the area of
Wrights Reservoir.
HEALTH INFORMATION...Public Health Recommendations: If smoke is
thick or becomes thick in your neighborhood you may want to remain
indoors. This is especially true for those with heart disease,
respiratory illnesses, the very young, and the elderly. Consider
limiting outdoor activity when moderate to heavy smoke is present.
Consider relocating temporarily if smoke is present indoors and is
making you ill. If visibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in
your neighborhood, smoke has reached levels that are unhealthy.</description>
