<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT
TUESDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, 1 to 2 feet of
inundation above ground level expected in low- lying areas
near shorelines and tidal waterways. For the Beach Hazards
Statement, dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Northern Outer Banks, Ocracoke and Hatteras Island.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 4 PM Saturday to 8
PM EDT Tuesday. For the Beach Hazards Statement, through
Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Rip currents can sweep even
the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Strong king tide cycle in combination
with southerly winds will lead to increased water levels
lasting into early next week. Water levels will rise through
the upcoming high tide cycles, peaking Monday night and
Tuesday night before receding through the middle of the week.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
