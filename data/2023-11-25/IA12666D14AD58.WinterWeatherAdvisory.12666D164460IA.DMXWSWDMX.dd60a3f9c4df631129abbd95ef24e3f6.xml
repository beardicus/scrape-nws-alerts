<description>...First Measurable Snowfall of the Season For Portions of
Southern into Central Iowa...
.Snow will continue to move across the area through the night
impacting much of central and southern Iowa. Conditions may
become quite slick in some areas, especially as the initial snow
melts and refreezes onto roadways. This has resulted in numerous
accidents across central and southern Iowa late this afternoon and
into the evening. Light to moderate snow accumulations are
expected in portions of southern into central Iowa through Sunday
morning.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM CST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Snow. Additional snow accumulations of up to two inches.
* WHERE...Marshall and Tama Counties.
* WHEN...Until 8 AM CST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on very slippery road conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...This will be the first measurable
snowfall of the season in these areas. Be prepared for snow
covered roads and allow extra time to reach your destination.</description>
