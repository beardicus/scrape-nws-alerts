<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued November 25 at 7:11AM PST until November 25 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST THIS
MORNING...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, increased threat of sneaker
waves expected.
* WHERE...San Francisco County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 10 AM PST this
morning. For the Beach Hazards Statement, through Sunday
morning.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only isolated
road closures expected. For the Beach Hazards Statement; large,
unexpected waves can sweep across the beach without warning,
sweeping people into the sea from rocks, jetties, and beaches.
These sneaker waves can also move large objects such as logs,
crushing anyone caught underneath.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Sneaker wave threat will be highest for
west to northwest facing beaches. In addition to the sneaker
wave threat, high astronomical tides are also expected this
weekend, which can cause further runup along the beaches.
Additionally, tidal levels are running a half-foot above
predictions and therefore likely to produce minor coastal
flooding.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Remain out of the water to avoid hazardous swimming conditions.</instruction>
