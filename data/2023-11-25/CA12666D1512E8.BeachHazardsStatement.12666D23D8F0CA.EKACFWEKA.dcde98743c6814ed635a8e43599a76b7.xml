<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM TO 11 AM
PST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, High astronomical tides
will cause minor flooding in low lying areas around the Humboldt
Bay, particularly in King Salmon and Jackson Ranch Road in
Arcata Bottoms. For the Beach Hazards Statement, increased
threat of sneaker waves expected.
* WHERE...Northern Humboldt Coast County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 9 AM to 11 AM PST
Sunday. For the Beach Hazards Statement, through Sunday
evening.. .
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Large, unexpected waves can
sweep across the beach without warning, sweeping people into
the sea from rocks, jetties, and beaches. These sneaker waves
can also move large objects such as logs, crushing anyone
caught underneath.</description>
<instruction>A Coastal Flood Advisory indicates that onshore winds and tides
will combine to generate flooding of low areas along the shore.
Feet Above Ground is locally defined as feet above the Highest
Astronomical Tide or HAT.
Don`t be fooled by an ocean that looks calm. There can be
30 minutes of small waves before a sneaker wave strikes. Avoid
rocks and jetties. Avoid steep beaches. Stay much farther back
from the water and never turn your back on the ocean.</instruction>
