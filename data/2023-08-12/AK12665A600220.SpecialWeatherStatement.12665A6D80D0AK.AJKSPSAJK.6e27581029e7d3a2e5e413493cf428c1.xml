<description>...A Strong Storm Moves Through the Panhandle...
A gale force low with a significant source of moisture is
currently moving through the the Gulf of Alaska. So far around 1
to 1.5 inches of rain has fallen across the area with another 1
to 1.5 before the heaviest precipitation looks to shift away from
Juneau this evening. Small streams are expected to rapid rises
from the heavy rainfall amounts with some reaching bankfull. For
those along the Mendenhall River, the rainy and windy conditions
could increase the risk of trees falling into and around from the
already unstable river banks.
This front is also bringing windy conditions to Juneau area with
reports of gusts as high as 35 mph near the airport with less
winds towards the back of Mendenhall Valley. These sustained winds
of 15 to 25 mph with periods of high gusts to 25 to 35 mph is
expected to continue into the early evening before diminishing.</description>
