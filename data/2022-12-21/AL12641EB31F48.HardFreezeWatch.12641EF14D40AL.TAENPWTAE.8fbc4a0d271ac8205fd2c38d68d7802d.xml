<headline>Hard Freeze Watch issued December 21 at 2:50AM CST until December 25 at 10:00AM CST by NWS Tallahassee</headline>
<description>...HARD FREEZE WATCH IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY EVENING THROUGH SUNDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Sub-freezing temperatures as low as 17 possible.
* WHERE...Portions of southeast Alabama, Big Bend and Panhandle
Florida and south central and southwest Georgia.
* WHEN...From Friday evening through Sunday morning.
* IMPACTS...Frost and freeze conditions could kill crops, other
sensitive vegetation and possibly damage unprotected outdoor
plumbing.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Temperatures Saturday afternoon will
struggle to get above freezing in many spots. If areas do manage
to rise above freezing Saturday afternoon, it would only be for
a few hours before falling below freezing after sunset Saturday
evening. Another hard freeze is expected again Saturday night
into Sunday morning. This prolonged period of sub-freezing
temperatures may place additional stress on exposed pipes and
present danger to unprotected people and pets.</description>
<instruction>Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing</instruction>
