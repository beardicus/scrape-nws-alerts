<description>...Significant Winter Storm with Blizzard Conditions and Extreme
Cold over the Next Few Days...
Blizzard Warnings Now in Effect Thursday into Saturday!
A powerful winter storm is beginning over the region and will last
into Friday night. A significant event is expected, including
periods of combined blizzard conditions and extreme cold. Travel
could be dangerous to near impossible at times Thursday and
Friday. Extreme cold is expected as well with wind chills falling
to 20 to 40 below zero from late Thursday through the end of the
week.
Those with holiday travel planned this evening through Friday
night are strongly encouraged to pay close attention to forecast
updates and road conditions, and prepare accordingly if travel is
a must. Altering travel plans, if possible, is strongly
encouraged.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM CST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Snow and a brief period of light freezing mist will
continue into the evening today, then snow will continue through
early Thursday. Winds will also increase Thursday and into
Friday night when blizzard conditions are possible. Total snow
accumulations of 2 to 4 inches, with locally higher amounts
possible. Wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph or greater may occur late
Thursday through Friday. Extreme cold and wind chills of 20 to
40 below will be common.
* WHERE...Southwest Iowa.
* WHEN...Now through 6 AM CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery and snow covered roads. Areas of
blowing snow and possible blizzard conditions will
significantly reduce visibility. Gusty winds could bring down
tree branches. The dangerously cold wind chills as low as 40
below zero could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little
as 10 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...It needs to be emphasized that the
combination of blowing snow, possible blizzard conditions, and
extreme cold will be very hazardous and possibly life
threatening if stranded outside.</description>

your vehicle in case of an emergency.
