TONIGHT...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM THURSDAY TO 7 AM

* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding
expected. For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip
currents.
* WHERE...South Walton, Coastal Bay and Coastal Gulf Counties.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 1 PM Thursday to 7
AM EST Friday. For the High Rip Current Risk, until midnight

* IMPACTS...Water levels will rise to between 1.5 ft and 2.5 ft

areas along the beachfront. At these levels, flooding affects
areas near the Panama City Marina as well as beach access points
in Panama City Beach. In addition to the coastal flood risk,
there is a high risk of rip currents. Rip currents can sweep
even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.

time of high tide, which is Thursday Evening around 7 pm CT at
Panama City Beach. The threat for coastal flooding will end when
winds shift offshore by daybreak Friday.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
