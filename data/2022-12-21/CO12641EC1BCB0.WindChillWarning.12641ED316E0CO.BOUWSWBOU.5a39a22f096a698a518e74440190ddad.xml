<headline>Wind Chill Warning issued December 21 at 9:28PM MST until December 23 at 11:00AM MST by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>.A cold arctic airmass is now covering northeastern Colorado. Decent
wind speeds will cause dangerous wind chill readings. Light to
moderate snow is fall and will continue overnight.  The greatest
snowfall will be in the higher mountains.
...WIND CHILL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 AM MST FRIDAY...
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM MST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...For the Winter Storm Warning, heavy snow expected. Total
snow accumulations between 3 and 10 inches. Winds gusting as high
as 60 mph. For the Wind Chill Warning, dangerously cold wind
chills expected. Wind chills as low as 50 below zero.
* WHERE...Rabbit Ears Pass, and the Park Range and northern Gore
Range.
* WHEN...For the Wind Chill Warning, until 11 AM MST Friday. For the
Winter Storm Warning, until 6 AM MST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Exposed skin may become quickly frostbitten or frozen.
Wind chill values may fall to extremely dangerous levels. Plan on
slippery road conditions. Widespread blowing snow could
significantly reduce visibility. Gusty winds could bring down tree
branches. The dangerously cold wind chills could cause frostbite
on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.</description>
<instruction>The combination of wind and cold temperatures will create
dangerously low wind chill values. Avoid outside activities if
possible. When outside, make sure you wear appropriate clothing, a
hat, and gloves.
If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road conditions for
Colorado can be obtained by calling 5 1 1 or by going to
