<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued December 21 at 9:24PM CST until December 24 at 6:00AM CST by NWS QuadCities</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM CST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Snow and blowing snow expected. Total snow accumulations
of 2 to 5 inches. Northwest winds could gust as high as 50 mph
by Friday. Blizzard conditions will also be possible, along with
extremely cold wind chills. Wind chills as low as 30 to 40
below zero will be possible, especially starting Thursday
afternoon.
* WHERE...In Iowa, Keokuk, Washington and Jefferson Counties. In
Illinois, Jo Daviess County.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commutes. Gusty
winds could bring down tree branches, leading to power outages.
Dangerously cold wind chills as low as 40 below zero could
cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Impacts from the combined effects of the
wind and snow are expected. Thus, blizzard conditions will be
possible, even after the falling snow has stopped. This will be
a long duration event, so plan appropriately prior to the start.
Plan holiday travel around peak hours of the storm, either
before or after impacts. If confidence increases, the Winter
Storm Warning may eventually be upgraded to a Blizzard Warning.</description>
