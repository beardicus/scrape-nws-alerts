<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued December 21 at 4:06PM EST until December 24 at 10:00AM EST by NWS Cleveland</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM FRIDAY TO 10 AM EST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Multi-hazard winter storm with a combination of strong
winds, very cold temperatures, snow, and blowing snow expected.
Total snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches. Winds gusting as
high as 60 mph. Wind chills values could be as low as 20 below
zero.
* WHERE...In Ohio, Cuyahoga and Geauga counties. In
Pennsylvania, Crawford county.
* WHEN...From 1 AM Friday to 10 AM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Areas of blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions
could impact the Friday morning commute and any holiday travel.
Strong winds could cause tree damage. The cold wind chills as
low as 20 below zero could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as
little as 30 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A window of brief intense snowfall is
expected with a cold front Thursday night into Friday. This
front will bring a sharp temperature drop over a matter of a few
hours, where temperatures above freezing will drop to the
single digits by Friday afternoon. A flash freeze is possible
with this occurrence. Winds will increase across the area early
Friday, especially Friday night, and be the main hazard for the
area with blowing snow also potentially causing hazardous
travel. Strong winds could cause damage to trees, bring down
power lines, and blow around unsecured objects. From Friday
through Sunday, a period of almost 48 hours where temperatures
remain in the single digits is possible. This combined with the
strong winds would allow for a long period of wind chills well
below zero and increase exposure risk and infrastructure
concerns across the area.</description>
