<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued December 21 at 3:04PM CST until December 22 at 6:00PM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Powerful Midwest Storm to Bring Whiteout Conditions For
Some...
.Very powdery snow is starting to overtake the area this
afternoon. Snow amounts ranging from 2 to 4 inches closer to
Interstate 35 in Minnesota and Iowa, up to 5 to 8 inches in
central and southwest Wisconsin are expected through Thursday
morning. The snow itself will make for difficult travel.
As the snow moves out on Thursday, northwest winds will be on the
increase, especially later in the day. The strongest winds will
occur Thursday night through Friday night, with gusts of 40 to 50
mph. This will cause blizzard and whiteout conditions in blowing
and drifting snow, especially west of the Mississippi River.
Therefore, a Blizzard Warning has been issued for that area. Wind
chill values will be from minus 20 to minus 40 from Thursday into
the holiday weekend.
One of the dangers if anyone gets stranded, especially in rural
areas, it would be very dangerous to be outside or walk on foot.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM CST
THURSDAY...
...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM THURSDAY TO 6 AM
CST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Winter Storm Warning, heavy snow expected.
Total snow accumulations of 3 to 5 inches. Winds gusting as
high as 40 mph. For the Blizzard Warning, blizzard conditions
expected. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of north central and northeast Iowa and
southeast Minnesota.
* WHEN...For the Winter Storm Warning, from 3 PM this afternoon
to 6 PM CST Thursday. For the Blizzard Warning, from 6 PM
Thursday to 6 AM CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute. Gusty
winds could bring down tree branches. The dangerously cold
wind chills as low as 40 below zero could cause frostbite on
exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.</description>

your vehicle in case of an emergency.

travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded,
stay with your vehicle.
