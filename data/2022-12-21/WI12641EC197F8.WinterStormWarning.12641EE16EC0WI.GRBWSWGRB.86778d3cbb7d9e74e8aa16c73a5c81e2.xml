<description>...A PROLONGED PERIOD OF WINTRY WEATHER WILL RESULT IN TRAVEL
DISRUPTIONS LEADING INTO THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND...
.A slow moving storm system will bring a prolonged period of wintry
weather to the area the next several days. The initial phase of the
storm will consist of mainly snow, which will fall tonight through
Thursday. The second phase will consist of lighter snow, but very
windy conditions with significant blowing and drifting snow and near
blizzard conditions in open areas. Finally, very cold air will surge
into the area on the strong northwest winds, resulting in bitterly
cold wind chills.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM CST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow. Accumulations of 5 to 8 inches expected through
Thursday. Additional lake effect snow accumulations of 4 to 8
inches in northern Vilas County and 1 to 3 inches farther south,
can be expect Thursday night through Friday night. Winds gusting
as high as 45 mph will cause considerable blowing and drifting
snow Thursday night through Friday night.
* WHERE...Oneida and Vilas Counties.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Snow will result in slippery roads and hazardous travel
conditions at times through Thursday. Travel conditions will
become dangerous at times Thursday night through Friday night when
winds increase. The strong winds will result in widespread blowing
and drifting snow, and possibly near-zero visibility at times in
open areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The strong winds will drive much colder air
into the area. The Wind Chill Index is expected to be in the 15
below to 30 below zero range Thursday night through Saturday.</description>
<instruction>Hazardous travel conditions are expected through Thursday. Dangerous
travel conditions are expected Thursday night through Saturday as
winds increase. Consider avoiding travel during this period unless
absolutely necessary. If you must travel during this period, drive
with extreme caution. Consider taking a winter storm kit along with
you, including such items as tire chains, booster cables,
flashlight, shovel, blankets and extra clothing. Also take water, a
first aid kit, and anything else that would help you survive in case
you become stranded. Be sure your vehicle has sufficient fuel before
crossing open areas.</instruction>
