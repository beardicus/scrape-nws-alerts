...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM THIS MORNING
TO 6 PM CST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Winter Storm Warning, heavy snow expected.
Total snow accumulations of 9 to 15 inches, except 18 to 23
inches for northern Iron county. Winds gusting as high as 45
mph. For the Wind Chill Advisory, very cold wind chills
expected. Wind chills as low as 30 below zero.
* WHERE...Bayfield, Ashland and Iron Counties. This includes the

Reservation.
* WHEN...For the Winter Storm Warning, from 9 AM Wednesday to 6

* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Areas
of blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute. The cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed
skin in as little as 30 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Blowing snow may create whiteout
conditions at times, especially along the exposed stretches of
U.S. Highway 2 between Ashland and Hurley. Snow loading on
trees from the past storm in combination with the high winds
may cause tree damage resulting in power outages in cold
weather.</description>
