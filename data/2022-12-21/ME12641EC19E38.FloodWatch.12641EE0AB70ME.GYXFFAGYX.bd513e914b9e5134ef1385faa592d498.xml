<headline>Flood Watch issued December 21 at 10:50PM EST until December 24 at 2:00AM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>.A strong storm system will bring a warm up with heavy rains and
strong winds Friday and Friday night. Widespread flooding is
possible given the combination of rainfall and snowmelt. The rain
will fall on frozen ground which will increase runoff and could
produce flash flooding. The snowpack along the coastal plains will
be significantly reduced if not completely melted out. For interior
and mountain regions, the snowpack will hold but will be reduced and
result in some additional runoff. Cold temperatures on the backside
of the storm system could cause flooded areas to freeze in place.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY MORNING THROUGH
SATURDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flash, urban, and small stream flooding expected from
widespread heavy rain and snowmelt.
* WHERE...Portions of Maine, including the following areas,
Androscoggin, Central Interior Cumberland, Coastal Cumberland,
Coastal Waldo, Coastal York, Interior Cumberland Highlands,
Interior Waldo, Interior York, Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln, Sagadahoc,
Southern Franklin, Southern Oxford and Southern Somerset. Portions
of New Hampshire, including the following areas, Belknap,
Cheshire, Coastal Rockingham, Eastern Hillsborough, Interior
Rockingham, Merrimack, Northern Carroll, Northern Grafton,
Southern Carroll, Southern Grafton, Strafford, Sullivan and
Western And Central Hillsborough.
* WHEN...From Friday morning through Saturday morning. Heavy rain
will fall Friday through Friday Night supporting flooding. Any
river flooding will likely continue through the weekend.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A storm system is forecast to bring 1 to 3 inches of rainfall
with the potential for locally higher amounts to the watch
area. Warm temperatures and heavy rain will support rapid
snowmelt which will add around an inch of additional runoff.
Frozen ground and snow blocked drainage will exacerbate
flooding conditions. The total combined runoff will cause
rapid rises on small streams and creeks which could produce
locally significant flooding.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Travel in and out of the region could be significantly
disrupted due to flooding. Those living in areas prone to flooding
should be prepared to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
