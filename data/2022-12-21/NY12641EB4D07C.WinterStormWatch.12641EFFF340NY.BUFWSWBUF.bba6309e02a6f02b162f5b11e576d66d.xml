<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued December 21 at 2:59PM EST until December 26 at 7:00AM EST by NWS Buffalo</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY MORNING THROUGH
MONDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...A rapid switch from rain to snow with sharply falling
temperatures into the teens and single digits will result in a
flash freeze on Friday. From Friday afternoon through most of
the weekend, very strong winds, heavy lake effect snow and
significant blowing and drifting snow will be possible. The
worst conditions will be over western portions of Monroe county.
Winds could gust as high as 60 mph Friday into Friday night.
Localized blizzard conditions are possible.
* WHERE...Monroe county.
* WHEN...From Friday morning through Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...Travel for the holiday weekend, including Friday,
could be very difficult to impossible at times. Areas of
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility with
whiteouts and localized blizzard conditions possible. The most
persistent and worst conditions will be where lake effect snow
is most widespread, which is still uncertain at this time.
Winds this strong could cause tree damage and power outages.
Cold wind chills as low as 10 to 20 below zero this weekend
could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 30
minutes.</description>
