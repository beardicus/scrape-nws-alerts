<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EST
TONIGHT...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM THURSDAY TO 7 AM
EST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding
expected. For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip
currents.
* WHERE...Coastal Franklin County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 7 PM Thursday to 7
AM EST Friday. For the High Rip Current Risk, until midnight
EST tonight.
* IMPACTS...Water levels will rise to 1.5 to 2.5 feet mean higher
high water around the time of high tide. These water levels
will result in minor flooding in Apalachicola near the boat ramp
and also along Water Street. Minor overwash is possible at
Alligator Point Road. Along St George Island, there is a high
risk of rip currents. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Water levels will be highest around the
time of high tide, which is around 130 am ET Friday morning. The
threat for coastal flooding will end by daybreak Friday as winds
shift offshore.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
