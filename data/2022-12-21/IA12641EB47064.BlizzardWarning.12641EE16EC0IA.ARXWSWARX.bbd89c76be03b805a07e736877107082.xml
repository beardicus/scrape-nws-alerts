<headline>Blizzard Warning issued December 21 at 11:13AM CST until December 24 at 6:00AM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Prolonged Winter Storm To Bring Whiteout Conditions For
Some...
.Very powdery snow will begin to spread into the region later
today and overnight, accumulating 3 to 6 inches across the entire
area. The snow will taper off Thursday morning, with winds
increasing as the afternoon progresses. The strongest winds will
occur Thursday night through Friday night, with gusts of 40 to 50
mph. This will cause blizzard and whiteout conditions in blowing
and drifting snow, especially west of the Mississippi River.
Therefore, a Blizzard Warning has been issued for that area. Wind
chill values will be from minus 20 to minus 40 from Thursday into
the holiday weekend.
...WINTER STORM WARNING NOW IN EFFECT FROM 3 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO
6 PM CST THURSDAY...

* WHEN...For the Winter Storm Warning, from 3 PM this afternoon

chills as low as 40 below zero could cause frostbite on exposed
