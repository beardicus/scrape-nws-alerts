<description>...A SURGE OF ARCTIC AIR WILL BRING BITTERLY COLD TEMPERATURES AND
DANGEROUSLY LOW WIND CHILLS TO THE REGION LATE THIS WEEK THROUGH
CHRISTMAS WEEKEND...
An arctic front will sweep across southeast Mississippi,
southwest and south central Alabama, and the western Florida
panhandle late Thursday night into early Friday morning.
Dangerously cold temperatures are expected to settle into our
area following the passage of the front and persist through the
weekend, with some very cold wind chill values expected both
Friday night and Saturday night.
Low temperatures by early Friday morning are expected to have
dropped to 20 degrees or below for most areas along and northwest
of the I-65 corridor, where a HARD FREEZE WATCH is now in effect.
Elsewhere and down to the coast, values in the low 20s, to at or
below freezing are expected.
Additionally, on early Friday morning, strong gusty northwesterly
winds will bring some blistering wind chills, with areas along
and northwest of I-65 forecasted to have wind chill values in the
single digits, with possibly a few location northwest of I-65
dropping just below zero through Friday morning, and likely
staying below 20 degree wind chills for these areas through the
day. Elsewhere, expect wind chill values to be generally 12 to 20
degrees through Friday morning for areas southwest of I-65.
Friday Night Through Saturday Night (Christmas Eve Night):
A HARD FREEZE WATCH IS IN EFFECT FOR THE ENTIRE AREA DURING THIS
TIMEFRAME. Lows will drop well into the teens across inland areas
for both Christmas Eve morning and Christmas morning, with low to
mid 20s along the immediate coast. It is important to note that
prolonged periods of freezing temperatures are possible and
portions of inland southeast Mississippi, inland southwest
Alabama, and south central Alabama may be near or below freezing
for 48 to 60 hours.
Once again, expect some blustery northwesterly winds to bring
dangerously low wind chills in the single digits and teens across
our region Friday morning through Christmas morning, with some
areas near and north of the Highway 84 corridor dropping below
zero.
Widespread Wind Chill Advisories for this outbreak of arctic air
will become necessary across much of our region during this time
frame and will be issued as the event gets closer. Expect below
normal temperatures with another HARD FREEZE possible on Christmas
Night.
SAFETY TIPS: Residents across the area should continue to monitor
the forecast closely this week. Prepare now for bitterly cold
temperatures. Take steps to protect water pipes and ensure people,
animals, and sensitive vegetation will have ready access to
warmth late this week and this holiday weekend. Also, keep in mind
proper space heater safety.</description>
