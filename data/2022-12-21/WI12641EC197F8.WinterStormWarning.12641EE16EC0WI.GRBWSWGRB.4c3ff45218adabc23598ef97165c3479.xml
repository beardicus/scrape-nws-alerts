<description>...A PROLONGED PERIOD OF WINTRY WEATHER WILL RESULT IN TRAVEL
DISRUPTIONS LEADING INTO THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND...
.A slow moving storm system will bring a prolonged period of wintry
weather to the area the next several days. The initial phase of the
storm will consist of mainly snow, which will fall tonight through
Thursday. The second phase will consist of lighter snow, but very
windy conditions with significant blowing and drifting snow and near
blizzard conditions in open areas. Finally, very cold air will surge
into the area on the strong northwest winds, resulting in bitterly
cold wind chills.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM CST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Snow accumulations of 5 to 9 inches expected tonight into
Thursday. Widespread blowing and drifting snow and additional snow
accumulations of 2 to 4 inches expected Thursday afternoon into
Saturday morning. The heaviest accumulations are expected in the
lakeshore counties. Winds gusting as high as 45 to 50 mph,
resulting in near-blizzard conditions at times Thursday night
through Friday night.
* WHERE...Manitowoc, Brown, Door, and Kewaunee Counties.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Snow will result in slippery roads and hazardous travel
conditions tonight through Thursday. Travel conditions will become
dangerous at times Thursday night through Friday night when winds
increase. The strong winds will result in widespread blowing and
drifting snow, and possibly near-zero visibility at times in open
areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The strong winds will drive much colder air
into the area. The Wind Chill Index is expected to be in the 10
below to 25 below zero range from Thursday night through Friday
night.</description>
<instruction>Hazardous travel conditions are expected late tonight through
Thursday. Dangerous travel conditions are expected Thursday night
through Friday night. Consider avoiding travel during this period
unless absolutely necessary. If you must travel during this period,
drive with extreme caution. Consider taking a winter storm kit along
with you, including such items as tire chains, booster cables,
flashlight, shovel, blankets and extra clothing. Also take water, a
first aid kit, and anything else that would help you survive in case
you become stranded. Be sure your vehicle has sufficient fuel before
crossing open areas.</instruction>
