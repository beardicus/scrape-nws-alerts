<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE THURSDAY NIGHT
THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Multi-hazard winter storm with a combination of strong
winds, very cold temperatures, snow, and blowing snow
possible. Total snow accumulations in excess of 4 inches
possible, especially in areas closer to Lake Erie. Winds could
gust as high as 60 mph. Wind chill values could be as low as
25 below zero.
* WHERE...Portions of northeast Ohio and northwest Pennsylvania.
* WHEN...From late Thursday night through Sunday morning.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Areas of blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions
could severely impact the Friday morning commute and any
holiday travel. Strong winds could cause tree damage. The cold
wind chills as low as 25 below zero could cause frostbite on
exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Strong winds in excess of 45 mph are
possible ahead of the storm system on Thursday night in
Northwest Pennsylvania. A window of brief intense snowfall is
possible with a cold frontal passage on Friday morning. This
front will also bring a sharp temperature drop over a matter of
a few hours, where temperatures above freezing Thursday night
will drop to the single digits by Friday afternoon. A flash
freeze is possible with this occurrence. Winds will increase
across the area on Friday, especially Friday night, and be the
main hazard for the area with blowing snow also potentially
causing hazardous travel. Strong winds could cause damage to
trees, bring down power lines, and blow around unsecured
objects. Snow will attempt to fill back in across far Northeast
Ohio and Northwest Pennsylvania with some lake enhancement,
especially along the lake shore and snow will continue through
most of Saturday. From Friday afternoon through Sunday, a period
of almost 48 hours where temperatures remain in the single
digits is possible. This combined with the strong winds would
allow for a long period of wind chills well below zero and
increase exposure risk and infrastructure concerns across the
area.</description>
