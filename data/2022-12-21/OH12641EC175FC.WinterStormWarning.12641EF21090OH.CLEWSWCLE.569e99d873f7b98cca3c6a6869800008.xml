<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM FRIDAY TO
4 PM EST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Multi-hazard winter storm with a combination of strong
winds, very cold temperatures, heavy snow, and blowing snow
expected. Total snow accumulations of greater than 6 inches
with up to a foot possible along the lakeshore in Erie County.
Winds gusting as high as 60 mph. Wind chills values could be
as low as 20 below zero.
* WHERE...In Ohio, Lake, Ashtabula Inland and Ashtabula
Lakeshore counties. In Pennsylvania, Northern Erie and
Southern Erie counties.
* WHEN...From 1 AM Friday to 4 PM EST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could severely impact the Friday morning commute
and any holiday travel. Strong winds could cause tree damage.
The cold wind chills as low as 25 below zero could cause
frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Strong winds in excess of 45 mph are
possible ahead of the storm system on Thursday night in
Northwest Pennsylvania. A window of brief intense snowfall is
possible with a cold frontal passage early Friday morning.
This front will also bring a sharp temperature drop over a
matter of a few hours, where temperatures above freezing
Thursday night will drop to the single digits by Friday
afternoon. A flash freeze is possible with this occurrence.
Winds will increase across the area on Friday, especially
Friday night, and be the main hazard for the area with blowing
snow also potentially causing hazardous travel. Strong winds
could cause damage to trees, bring down power lines, and blow
around unsecured objects. Lake effect snow will continue into
this weekend with the highest amounts along the shoreline in
Ashtabula and Erie Counties. From Friday through Sunday, a
period of almost 48 hours where temperatures remain in the
single digits is possible. This combined with the strong winds
would allow for a long period of wind chills well below zero
and increase exposure risk and infrastructure concerns across
the area.</description>
