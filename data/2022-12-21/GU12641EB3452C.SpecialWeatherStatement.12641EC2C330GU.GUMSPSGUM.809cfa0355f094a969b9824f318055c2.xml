<description>...AN UNSETTLED PATTERN EXPECTED FOR THE MARIANAS THROUGH CHRISTMAS
WEEKEND...
A developing wet pattern is expected to affect the Marianas over the
next several days, including Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. A weak
circulation, Invest 94W, located near 5.7N 147.1E, is expected to
move northwestward, then north-northwestward. Meanwhile, a shear
line drifts south toward the CNMI. These two systems will interact to
bring increasing convection to the region for the end of the week
into next week, including Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Latest
model guidance varies greatly on expected rainfall, however, they do
agree that the region will see a wet and unsettled pattern into next
week. The current forecast calls for showers to peak across the
region on Friday, then slowly diminish through the weekend and early
next week. Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches, with locally heavier
amounts, are possible. This is not expected to pose a flooding threat
at this time, however, this could change depending on how the
systems develop over the next couple of days. If confidence in the
potential for flooding increases by Thursday, a Flash Flood Watch may
be needed. Another Special Weather Statement will only be issued if
expected conditions worsen over the next 24 hours.
Gusty winds will continue through tonight, then are expected to
decrease a bit for the remainder of the week. As Invest 94W
approaches the Marianas, gusty winds become a possibility again.
Folks in the Marianas should keep up-to-date with the latest
statements and advisories from the National Weather Service and your
local emergency management offices. Forecast products issued by the
National Weather Service are posted on the WFO Guam web page at
