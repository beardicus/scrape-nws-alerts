<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 21 at 1:44PM MST until December 23 at 5:00AM MST by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>...EXTREME COLD AND DANGEROUS WIND CHILLS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH
FRIDAY...
...TRAVEL IMPACTS DUE TO BLOWING SNOW THROUGH FRIDAY...
.Snowfall today with a quick moving system will exit the area by
early this evening. However, gusty winds will persist across much
of the area through early Friday, with the strongest winds
developing late tonight through Thursday evening. The combination
of wind and freshly fallen snowfall will result in blowing snow
and blizzard or near blizzard conditions at times across the
northwest into west central South Dakota plains. Areas of blowing
snow can be expected elsewhere on the plains, with reduced
visibilities at times, especially on Thursday.
Dangerously cold wind chills will continue over western South
Dakota and northeastern Wyoming through the week. The coldest
wind chills are expected tonight through Friday morning, with
values of 30 below to near 60 below zero in most areas through
Friday morning.

...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 AM MST
FRIDAY...
