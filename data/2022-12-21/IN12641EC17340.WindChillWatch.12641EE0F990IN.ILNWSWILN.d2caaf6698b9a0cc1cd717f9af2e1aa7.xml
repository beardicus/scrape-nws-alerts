<headline>Wind Chill Watch issued December 21 at 9:40PM EST until December 24 at 4:00AM EST by NWS Wilmington</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM THURSDAY TO
5 PM EST FRIDAY...
...WIND CHILL WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE THURSDAY NIGHT
THROUGH LATE FRIDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...For the Winter Storm Warning, heavy snow expected.
Total snow accumulations of 2 to 4 inches. Winds gusting as
high as 50 mph. For the Wind Chill Watch, dangerously cold
wind chills possible. Wind chills as low as 30 below zero.
* WHERE...Portions of East Central Indiana and West Central Ohio.
* WHEN...For the Winter Storm Warning, from 7 PM Thursday to 5
PM EST Friday. For the Wind Chill Watch, from late Thursday
night through late Friday night.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Patchy blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute. Gusty
winds could bring down tree branches. The dangerously cold
wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little
as 10 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Temperatures will drop sharply in the
matter of a few hours during Thursday night, rapidly falling
well below freezing, leading to the potential for a flash
freeze. This will cause travel conditions to rapidly
deteriorate.</description>
