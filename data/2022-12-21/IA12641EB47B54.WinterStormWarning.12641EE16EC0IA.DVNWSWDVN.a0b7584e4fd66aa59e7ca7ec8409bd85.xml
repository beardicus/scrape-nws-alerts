<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM THIS EVENING
TO 6 AM CST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Snow and blowing snow expected. Total snow accumulations
of 2 to 5 inches. Northwest winds could gust as high as 50 mph
by Friday. Blizzard conditions will also be possible, along with
extremely cold wind chills. Wind chills as low as 30 to 40
below zero will be possible, especially starting Thursday
afternoon.
* WHERE...Portions of northwest Illinois and east central,
northeast and southeast Iowa.
* WHEN...From 6 PM Wednesday to 6 AM CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on dangerous road conditions. Widespread
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commutes. Gusty winds could bring down tree branches, leading
to power outages. The dangerously cold wind chills as low as
40 below zero could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as
little as 10 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Impacts from the combined effects of the
wind and snow are expected. Thus, blizzard conditions will be
possible, even after the falling snow has stopped. This will be
a long duration event, so plan appropriately prior to the
start. Plan holiday travel around peak hours of the storm,
either before or after impacts. If confidence increases, the
Winter Storm Warning may eventually be upgraded to a blizzard
warning.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
