<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued December 21 at 11:13AM CST until December 24 at 6:00AM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Prolonged Winter Storm To Bring Whiteout Conditions For
Some...
.Very powdery snow will begin to spread into the region later
today and overnight, accumulating 3 to 6 inches across the entire
area. The snow will taper off Thursday morning, with winds
increasing as the afternoon progresses. The strongest winds will
occur Thursday night through Friday night, with gusts of 40 to 50
mph. This will cause blizzard and whiteout conditions in blowing
and drifting snow, especially west of the Mississippi River.
Therefore, a Blizzard Warning has been issued for that area. Wind
chill values will be from minus 20 to minus 40 from Thursday into
the holiday weekend.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 3 PM THIS
AFTERNOON TO 6 AM CST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 3 to 5
inches through Thursday. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph will
cause widespread blowing and drifting snow, with localized
whiteout conditions Thursday night through Friday night.
* WHERE...Taylor, Buffalo and Trempealeau Counties.
* WHEN...From 3 PM this afternoon to 6 AM CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute. The
cold wind chills as low as 35 below zero could cause frostbite
on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.</description>
