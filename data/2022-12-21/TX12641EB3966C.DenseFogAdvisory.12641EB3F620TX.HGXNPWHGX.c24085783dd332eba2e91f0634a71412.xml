<description>...DENSE FOG ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM CST THIS MORNING...
...HARD FREEZE WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...For the Dense Fog Advisory, visibility one quarter mile
or less in dense fog. For the Hard Freeze Watch, prolonged
subfreezing temperatures are expected. Temperatures will
remain below freezing for up to 36 to 46 hours with overnight
lows below 15 across these counties during that time period.
* WHERE...Trinity and Walker Counties.
* WHEN...For the Dense Fog Advisory, until 8 AM CST this
morning. For the Hard Freeze Watch, from Thursday afternoon
through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Frost and freeze conditions could kill crops, other
sensitive vegetation and possibly damage unprotected outdoor
plumbing. Hazardous driving conditions due to low visibility.</description>
<instruction>Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.
If driving, slow down, use your headlights, and leave plenty of
distance ahead of you.</instruction>
