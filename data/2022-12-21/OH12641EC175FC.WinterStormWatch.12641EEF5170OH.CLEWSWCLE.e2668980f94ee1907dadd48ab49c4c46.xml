<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued December 21 at 9:47PM EST until December 24 at 10:00PM EST by NWS Cleveland</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE THURSDAY NIGHT
THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Multi-hazard winter storm with a combination of strong
winds, very cold temperatures, snow, and blowing snow
possible. Total snow accumulations of 2 to 4 inches possible.
Winds could gust as high as 50 mph. Wind chill values could be
as low as 25 below zero.
* WHERE...Portions of northeast Ohio.
* WHEN...From late Thursday night through Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could severely impact the Friday morning commute
and any holiday travel. Gusty winds could bring down tree
branches. The cold wind chills as low as 25 below zero could
cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A window of brief intense snowfall is
possible with a cold frontal passage on Friday morning. This
front will also bring a sharp temperature drop over a matter
of a few hours, where temperatures above freezing Thursday
night will drop to the single digits by Friday afternoon. A
flash freeze is possible with this occurrence. Winds will
increase across the area on Friday, especially Friday night,
and be the main hazard for the area with blowing snow also
potentially causing hazardous travel. Strong winds could cause
damage to trees, bring down power lines, and blow around
unsecured objects. Snow will attempt to fill back in across
the area on Friday night into Saturday for some additional
minor snow accumulations. From Friday afternoon through
Sunday, a period of almost 48 hours where temperatures remain
in the single digits is possible. This combined with the
strong winds would allow for a long period of wind chills well
below zero and increase exposure risk and infrastructure
concerns across the area.</description>
