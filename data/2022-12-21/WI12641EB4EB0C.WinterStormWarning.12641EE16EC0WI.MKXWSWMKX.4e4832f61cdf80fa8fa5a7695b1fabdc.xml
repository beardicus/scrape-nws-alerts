SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Snow accumulations of 4 to 7 inches. Steady snow will

Thursday, dropping to 25 to 35 below zero for late Thursday
afternoon through Friday night.
* WHERE...Fond du Lac and Dodge Counties.

conditions at times. Commutes will likely be impacted Thursday
morning through Friday evening. Gusty winds could bring down
tree branches. The dangerously cold wind chills as low as 35
below zero could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as
10 minutes.</description>
