<instruction>Avoid outside activities if possible. When outside, make sure you
wear appropriate clothing, a hat, and gloves.
Wrap pipes with insulation and seal windows to avoid loss of heat
from your home. Keep a slow steady stream of water running from
indoor faucets, and open cabinet doors to allow warm air to
circulate around inside pipes.
Roads in the advisory area may become slick and hazardous due to
snow accumulation and a brief period of freezing rain or sleet,
especially on bridges and overpasses.
Slow down and use caution while traveling.
