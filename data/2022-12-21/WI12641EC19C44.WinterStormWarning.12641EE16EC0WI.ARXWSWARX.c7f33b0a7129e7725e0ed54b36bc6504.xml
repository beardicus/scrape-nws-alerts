<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued December 21 at 9:45PM CST until December 24 at 6:00AM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Powerful Midwest Storm to Bring Whiteout Conditions For Some...
.Very powdery snow continues to fall across the region with
snowcovered roads and reduced visibilities mostly between 1 and 2
miles, however at times visibilities have been reduced to one half
mile or less. Numerous crashes and slide-offs have been reported
during the evening hours. The snow will continue to push through
overnight in waves and we continue to look for snow amounts from 2
to 4 inches toward Interstate 35 in Minnesota and Iowa and up to 5
to 8 inches for central and southwest Wisconsin through Thursday
morning.
Northwest winds will be on the increase Thursday, especially
later in the day. The strongest winds will occur Thursday night
through Friday night, with gusts of 40 to 50 mph. This will cause
blizzard and whiteout conditions in blowing and drifting snow,
especially west of the Mississippi River. Therefore, a Blizzard
Warning has been issued for that area. Wind chill values will be
from minus 20 to minus 40 from Thursday into the holiday weekend.
One of the dangers if anyone gets stranded, especially in rural
areas, it would be very dangerous to be outside or walk on foot.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM CST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow. Additional snow accumulations of 2 to 4
inches. Total snow accumulations 3 to 6 inches. Winds gusting as
high as 45 mph will cause widespread blowing and drifting snow,
with localized whiteout conditions Thursday night through
Friday night.
* WHERE...Taylor, Buffalo and Trempealeau Counties.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute. Gusty winds
could bring down tree branches. The cold wind chills as low as
35 below zero could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little
as 30 minutes.</description>
