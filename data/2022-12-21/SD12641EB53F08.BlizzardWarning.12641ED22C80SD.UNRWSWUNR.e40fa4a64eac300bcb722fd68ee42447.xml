<headline>Blizzard Warning issued December 21 at 3:42PM MST until December 23 at 5:00AM MST by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>...EXTREME COLD AND DANGEROUS WIND CHILLS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH
FRIDAY...
...TRAVEL IMPACTS DUE TO BLOWING SNOW THROUGH FRIDAY...
.Snowfall today with a quick moving system will exit the area by
early this evening. However, gusty winds will persist across much
of the area through early Friday, with the strongest winds
developing late tonight through Thursday evening. The combination
of wind and freshly fallen snowfall will result in blowing snow
and blizzard or near blizzard conditions at times across the
northwest into west central South Dakota plains. Areas of blowing
snow can be expected elsewhere on the plains, with reduced
visibilities at times, especially on Thursday.
Dangerously cold wind chills will continue over western South
Dakota and northeastern Wyoming through the week. The coldest
wind chills are expected tonight through Friday morning, with
values of 30 below to near 60 below zero in most areas through
Friday morning.
...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 AM MST FRIDAY...
...WIND CHILL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM MST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Blizzard Warning, blizzard conditions expected at
times due to blowing snow. Winds gusting as high as 50 mph,
especially on Thursday. For the Wind Chill Warning, dangerously
cold wind chills. Wind chills as low as 55 below zero.
* WHERE...Harding County, Perkins County, Butte County, the
Northern Meade County Plains and Ziebach County. This includes
the Tribal Lands of the Cheyenne River Reservation.
* WHEN...For the Wind Chill Warning, until 5 PM MST Friday. For
the Blizzard Warning, until 5 AM MST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. Gusty winds could
bring down tree branches. The dangerously cold wind chills
could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 5
minutes.</description>
