<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 21 at 1:19PM PST until December 23 at 7:00AM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...AREAS OF FREEZING RAIN AND WINTRY MIX POSSIBLE THURSDAY
AFTERNOON INTO FRIDAY MORNING...
.Cold arctic air will funnel down from the Willamette Valley, into
the far northern area of Douglas County. This cold air will remain
in place while a warm front brings overrunning precipitation into
the area. This will bring the threat of freezing rain until the
cold air is scoured out by southerly winds expected late Thursday.
East of the Cascades, a more wintry mix is expected, but pockets
of cold air will maintain the possibility for freezing rain,
especially from the Chemult area northward.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM THURSDAY TO 7 AM
PST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Wintry mix and periods of freezing rain expected, which could
result a thin layer of ice.
* WHERE...Portions of the Klamath Basin as well as portions of
Lake County below 5000 feet. This includes Highways 97, 395, 31,
140, 62, 66 and 139. This does include the communities of
Klamath Falls, Chiloquin, Chemult, Bly, Lakeview, Dorris,
Macdoel, and Paisley.
* WHEN...From 7 PM Thursday to 7 AM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Ice will create slippery and hazardous road
conditions, which may impact the morning commute. This could
also create a slip hazard on walkways.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Confidence in the potential for freezing
rain is highest from Chemult northward, but isolated areas of
wintry mix and freezing rain are possible elsewhere in the
advisory area.
* View the hazard area in detail at
