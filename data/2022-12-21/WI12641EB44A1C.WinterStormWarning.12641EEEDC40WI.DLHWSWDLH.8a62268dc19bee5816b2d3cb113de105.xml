<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued December 21 at 10:15AM CST until December 24 at 6:00PM CST by NWS Duluth</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM CST
SATURDAY...
...WIND CHILL ADVISORY HAS EXPIRED...
* WHAT...Heavy snow. Additional snow accumulations of 6 to 12
inches, except 12 to 16 inches for northern Iron County. Winds
gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Bayfield, Ashland and Iron Counties. This includes the
Tribal Lands of the Red Cliff Band and the Bad River
Reservation.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Patchy
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute. The cold wind chills as low as 30 below zero could
cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Blowing snow may create whiteout
conditions at times, especially along the exposed stretches of
U.S. Highway 2 between Ashland and Hurley. Snow loading on
trees from the past storm in combination with the high winds
may cause tree damage resulting in power outages in cold
weather.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.
Road conditions can also be found at 511mn.org for Minnesota or
