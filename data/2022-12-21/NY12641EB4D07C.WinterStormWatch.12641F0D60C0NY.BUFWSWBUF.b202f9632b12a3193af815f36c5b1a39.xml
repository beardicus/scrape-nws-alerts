<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued December 21 at 2:59PM EST until December 26 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Buffalo</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH MONDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...A rapid switch from rain to snow with sharply falling
temperatures into the teens will result in a flash freeze
Friday afternoon. From Friday night through most of the
weekend, strong winds, heavy lake effect snow and significant
blowing and drifting snow will be possible. Winds could gust
as high as 65 mph Friday. Localized blizzard conditions will
be possible with gusts to 50 mph Friday night and Saturday.
* WHERE...Jefferson and Lewis counties.
* WHEN...From Friday afternoon through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...Travel for the holiday weekend could be very
difficult to impossible at times, especially for northern
parts of both counties. Areas of blowing snow could
significantly reduce visibility with whiteouts and localized
blizzard conditions possible. The most persistent and worst
conditions will be where lake effect snow is most widespread,
which is still uncertain at this time. Winds this strong could
cause tree damage and power outages.</description>
<instruction>Begin needed preparations at home or with your vehicle. Travel
may become difficult, so plan accordingly.</instruction>
