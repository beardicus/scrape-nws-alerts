<headline>Flood Warning issued December 21 at 8:03AM EST until further notice by NWS Melbourne</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in Florida...
St Johns River Near Astor affecting Volusia and Lake Counties.
.Tidal influence has led to a rise in levels along the Saint Johns
River at Astor overnight with levels holding steady around 2.6 ft
over the next day. Once the astronomical high tides subside later
this week, northerly winds behind an approaching front will keep
levels from returning to a steady decline, but that is expected to
resume into the weekend. Astor is forecast to drop below Minor Flood
Stage by the middle of next week.
For the St. Johns River...including Astor...Minor flooding is
forecast.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
The next statement will be issued this evening at 900 PM EST.
