<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM TO 7 PM EST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of up to two
inches. Winds gusting as high as 55 mph.
* WHERE...Henderson County.
* WHEN...From 1 AM to 7 PM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Patches of black ice
will develop on bridges and overpasses Saturday morning,
resulting in slippery spots. The cold wind chills as low as 10
below zero could result in hypothermia if precautions are not
taken.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Rain will change to snow across the
mountains of North Carolina early Saturday morning, beginning
on the highest peaks and ridgetops of the Smokies around
midnight and down to the valley floors by sunrise, as
temperatures fall quickly below freezing. Snow will taper off
to the Tennessee border by mid- morning, and should end
everywhere by sunset Saturday. Temperatures across the
mountains will remain below freezing through Saturday, so
black ice is possible. Winds will be strong enough to knock
down a few tree limbs and power lines Saturday. The cold
temperatures and strong winds will also result in bitterly
cold wind chills Saturday afternoon and Saturday night at high
elevations.</description>
