AND NORTHEASTERN LAKE COUNTIES...
At 1247 PM CST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from 14 miles southeast of Gunflint Lake, to Boundary
Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, to 10 miles southwest of Eagle
Mountain, to 11 miles south of Little Saganaga Lake, moving
southeast at 25 mph.
HAZARD...Extremely poor visibility in heavy snow and blowing snow.
Wind gusts up to 30 mph.
SOURCE...Satellite and webcams.
IMPACT...Dangerous life-threatening travel.
* This includes Minnesota Highway 61 between Hovland and Tofte and
the Gunflint Trail between Grand Marais and Gunflint Lake.
Locations impacted include...
Grand Marais, Gunflint Lake, Lutsen, Hovland, Eagle Mountain, Little
Saganaga Lake, Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness North of the
Gunflint Trail, southeastern Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness,
Bearskin Lake, Kekekabic Lake, Alice Lake, Phoebe Lake, North Lake,
Judge Magney State Park, White Pine Lake, Gabimichigami Lake, Brule
Lake, Judge C. R. Magney State Park, Cherokee Lake, and Thomas Lake.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Reduce your speed and turn on headlights! During snow squalls, the
visibility may suddenly drop to near zero in whiteout conditions.
There is no safe place on a highway when a snow squall hits.
Visibility and traction are immediately lost in whiteout conditions,
making it difficult or impossible to slow down and avoid stopped
vehicles. Delay travel or safely exit the highway before the snow
squall arrives.</description>
