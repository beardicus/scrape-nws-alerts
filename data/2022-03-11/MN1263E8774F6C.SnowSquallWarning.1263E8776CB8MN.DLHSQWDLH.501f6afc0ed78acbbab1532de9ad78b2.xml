<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 230 PM CST FOR COOK
AND NORTHEASTERN LAKE COUNTIES...
At 154 PM CST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from 6 miles north of Hovland, to 17 miles east of Eagle
Mountain, to near Grand Marais, to 7 miles northeast of Lutsen, to 15
miles south of Little Saganaga Lake, moving southeast at 25 mph.
HAZARD...Extremely poor visibility in heavy snow and blowing snow.
Wind gusts up to 30 mph.
SOURCE...Satellite and webcams.
IMPACT...Dangerous life-threatening travel.
* This includes Minnesota Highway 61 between Hovland and Tofte and
the Gunflint Trail between Grand Marais and Gunflint Lake.
Locations impacted include...
Grand Marais, Gunflint Lake, Grand Portage, Lutsen, Hovland, Eagle
Mountain, Little Saganaga Lake, Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness
North of the Gunflint Trail, southeastern Boundary Waters Canoe Area
Wilderness, Pine Lake, Tom Lake, Bearskin Lake, Grand Portage
Reservation, Kekekabic Lake, North Lake, Judge Magney State Park,
Watab Lake, White Pine Lake, Gabimichigami Lake, and Brule Lake.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Reduce your speed and turn on headlights! During snow squalls, the
visibility may suddenly drop to near zero in whiteout conditions.
There is no safe place on a highway when a snow squall hits.
Visibility and traction are immediately lost in whiteout conditions,
making it difficult or impossible to slow down and avoid stopped
vehicles. Delay travel or safely exit the highway before the snow
squall arrives.</description>
