<headline>Special Weather Statement issued March 11 at 4:08PM EST  by NWS Paducah</headline>
<description>...Snowfall expected to increase through the Friday evening rush
hour...
A band of light to moderate snowfall is expected to develop
across the southeast Missouri Delta region, including the Missouri
Bootheel during the late afternoon hours and quickly spread
northeast across extreme southern Illinois, west Kentucky and into
parts of southwest Indiana.
Some of the precipitation may begin as a mix of rain or sleet
along the leading edge, before changing all to snow.
Within an hour after the snowfall begins, expect the snow to
accumulate on grassy and elevated surfaces, such as bridges and
overpasses. Some untreated secondary roads may also see a coating
of snow. With temperatures expected to dip at or below freezing by
6 pm, road surfaces may become slick with the snow.
Snowfall rates of one quarter to one half inch of snow may occur
over a one to two hour period during the peak of the snowfall. One
to two inches of snow is not out of the question before the snow
finally ends.
Visibility in the snow will likely range between one and three
miles for travelers during the rush hour. In heavier bands of
snow, visibility may drop below one mile in a short period of
time. If you must travel, please use extreme caution.
The time period for greatest concern for travelers will be between
5 pm and 8 pm this evening. After that time, snowfall should begin
to diminish from northwest to southeast across the area.
Be watchful for wet surfaces overnight, as roads may remain slick
with below freezing temperatures across the area.
Temperatures will continue to drop through the night with lows in
the teens and wind chills in the single digits.</description>
