* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Rain will change to snow across the

and down to the valley floors by sunrise, as temperatures fall
quickly below freezing. Snow will taper off to the Tennessee
border by mid- morning, and should end everywhere by sunset
Saturday. Temperatures across the mountains will remain below
freezing through Saturday, so black ice is possible. Winds will
be strong enough to knock down a few tree limbs and power lines
Saturday. The cold temperatures and strong winds will also
result in bitterly cold wind chills Saturday afternoon and
Saturday night at high elevations.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Warning for heavy snow means severe winter weather
conditions are expected or occurring. Significant amounts of snow
are forecast that will make travel dangerous. Only travel in an
emergency. If you must travel, keep a flashlight, food, water,
and a warm blanket in your vehicle in case of an emergency.
A Winter Weather Advisory for snow means that periods of snow
will cause primarily travel difficulties. Be prepared for snow
covered roads and limited visibilities, and use caution while
driving.
A Wind Chill Advisory means that very cold air and strong winds
will combine to generate low wind chills. This will result in
frost bite and lead to hypothermia if precautions are not taken.
If you must venture outdoors, make sure you wear a hat and
gloves.
