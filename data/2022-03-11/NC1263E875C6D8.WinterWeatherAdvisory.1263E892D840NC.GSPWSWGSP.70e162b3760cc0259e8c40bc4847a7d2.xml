<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued March 11 at 4:50AM EST until March 12 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM TO 7 PM EST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of up to two
inches. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Buncombe, Northern Jackson and Macon Counties.
* WHEN...From 1 AM to 7 PM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The cold wind
chills as low as 5 below zero could result in hypothermia if
precautions are not taken.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Rain will change to snow across the
mountains of North Carolina early Saturday morning, beginning on
the highest peaks and ridgetops around midnight and down to the
valley floors by sunrise, as temperatures fall quickly below
freezing. Snow will taper off to the Tennessee border by mid-
morning, and should end everywhere by sunset Saturday.
Temperatures across the mountains will remain below freezing
through Saturday, so black ice is possible. Winds will be strong
enough to knock down a few tree limbs and power lines Saturday.
The cold temperatures and strong winds will also result in
bitterly cold wind chills Saturday afternoon and Saturday night
at high elevations.</description>
