<description>...Elevated Surf Tuesday Through Thursday...
...Snow and Blowing Snow With Low Visibility Tuesday Through
Wednesday...
West winds of 25 to 40 mph blowing over a very long fetch of open
water over the Arctic Ocean and Chukchi Sea will cause elevated
water levels and elevated surf along the Western Arctic Coast from
Tuesday through Thursday. Sea levels could rise several feet
above the high tide line. Wind driven waves will crash high up the
beach. These conditions will lead to siginifcant erosion and
possibly minor flooding along the Arctic Coast from Point Barrow
West from Tuesday through Thursday.
Snow showers will become widespread on Tuesday and continue
through Wednesday. Between 4 and 7 inches of snow is possible
through Wednesday. The snow will combine with winds of 25 to 40
mph to cause low visibility at times.</description>
