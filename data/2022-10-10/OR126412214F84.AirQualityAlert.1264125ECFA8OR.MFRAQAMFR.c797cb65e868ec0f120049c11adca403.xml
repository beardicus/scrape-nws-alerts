<headline>Air Quality Alert issued October 10 at 1:25PM PDT  by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...Oregon Department of Environmental Quality has issued an Air
Quality Advisory in effect until the end of Friday...
The Cedar Creek Fire combined with northerly winds will cause smoke
concentrations to increase. Air Quality is expected to reach
unhealthy levels at times within Northern Klamath and Douglas
Counties.
Smoke levels can change rapidly depending on the weather. Check
current conditions on the Oregon Smoke Information Blog
oregonsmoke.org, DEQ’s Air Quality Index, or by downloading the free
OregonAIR app on your smartphone.
- Smoke can irritate the eyes and lungs and worsen some medical conditions.
People most at risk include infants and young children, people
with heart or lung disease, older adults and pregnant people.
- Protect yourself and your family when smoke levels are high:
- Stay inside if possible. Keep windows and doors closed. If it’s too
hot, run air conditioning on recirculate or consider moving to a
cooler location. Avoid strenuous outdoor activity.
- Use a high efficiency particulate air(HEPA) filter in indoor
ventilation systems or portable air purifiers.
- Be aware of smoke in your area and avoid places with the highest
levels.
- If you have a breathing plan for a medication condition, be sure
to follow it and keep any needed medications refilled.
