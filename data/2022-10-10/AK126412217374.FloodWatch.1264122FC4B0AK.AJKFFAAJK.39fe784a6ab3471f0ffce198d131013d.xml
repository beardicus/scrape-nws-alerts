<headline>Flood Watch issued October 10 at 1:17PM AKDT  by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH LATE
FRIDAY NIGHT...
* WHEN...From Wednesday afternoon through late Friday night.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, other low-lying areas and flood-prone locations.
Isolated landslides are possible in areas of steep terrain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- An atmospheric river will move over the Gulf of Alaska and
into
the panhandle for the latter half of this week. This will
bring periods of moderate to heavy rain as the moisture band
moves
over panhandle. Rivers and streams will respond with rises
likely exceeding their banks.
This situation will continue to be monitored and updated as
more
information becomes available.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.
Stay tuned to further developments by listening to your local radio,
television, or NOAA Weather Radio for further information.</instruction>
