<headline>Flood Watch issued April 22 at 11:27AM CDT  by NWS Eastern ND and Grand Forks</headline>
<description>.Showers and thunderstorms are anticipated to continue through the
next 36 hours across most of the area. Heavy rainfall may combine
with antecedent frost depth, soil moisture, and ongoing snow melt to
create overland flooding. Flash flooding may also occur where the
heaviest rainfall rates persist for extended periods of time. This
will also cause additional rises in river levels as water drains
into creeks and rivers.

Clearwater, West Marshall and West Polk. In North Dakota, Barnes,
Benson, Cavalier, Eastern Walsh, Eddy, Grand Forks, Griggs,
Nelson, Pembina, Ramsey, Steele, Towner, Traill and Western Walsh.
