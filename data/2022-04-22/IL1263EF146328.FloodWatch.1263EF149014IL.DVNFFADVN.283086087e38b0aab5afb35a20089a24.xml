<headline>Flood Watch issued April 22 at 10:30AM CDT  by NWS QuadCities</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM CDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of northwest Illinois and Iowa, including the
following counties, in northwest Illinois, Carroll, Jo Daviess,
Rock Island and Whiteside. In Iowa, Benton, Buchanan, Cedar,
Clinton, Delaware, Dubuque, Iowa, Jackson, Johnson, Jones, Linn,
Muscatine and Scott.
* WHEN...Until 7 PM CDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Showers and thunderstorms are expected to move across the
area today. A very moist airmass will lead to the potential
for high rainfall rates and amounts of 1 to 3 inches in some
locations over a short period of time. This could lead to an
increased risk for flash flooding where the heaviest rain
occurs.
