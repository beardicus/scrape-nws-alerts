THIS WEEKEND...
.A robust spring storm will bring heavy snow accumulations and
very strong winds this weekend to portions of northeastern

Black Hills. Heavy snow of 10 to 18 inches is expected across
northeast Wyoming, along with northwest wind gusts over 60 mph.
Heavy snow and wind gusts to 70 mph are expected across northwest
South Dakota. This will result in white out conditions across
these areas and the northern Foothills. The northern Black Hills
will see significant snowfall of up to 24 inches, with locally
higher amounts possible, but winds will be weaker than across the
surrounding plains.

* WHEN...From 6 AM Saturday to 6 AM MDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. Very strong winds
