THIS WEEKEND...
.A robust spring storm will bring heavy snow accumulations and

Black Hills. Heavy snow of 10 to 18 inches is expected across
northeast Wyoming, along with northwest wind gusts over 65 mph.
Heavy snow and wind gusts to 75 mph are expected across northwest
South Dakota. This will result in white out conditions across
these areas and the northern Foothills. The northern Black Hills
will see significant snowfall of up to 20 inches, with locally
higher amounts possible, but winds will be weaker than across the
surrounding plains.
