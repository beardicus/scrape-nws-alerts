<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM EST THIS
EVENING...
...WIND CHILL WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY MORNING THROUGH
SATURDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Winter Storm Warning, heavy mixed precipitation
expected. Total snow accumulations up to 4 inches and ice
accumulations around two tenths of an inch. Winds gusting as high
as 40 mph. For the Wind Chill Watch, dangerously cold wind chills
possible. Wind chills as low as 45 below zero.
* WHERE...Eastern Tucker County.
* WHEN...For the Winter Storm Warning, until 6 PM EST this evening.
For the Wind Chill Watch, from Friday morning through Saturday
evening.
* IMPACTS...Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will
likely become slick and hazardous. Significant ice accumulation on
power lines and tree limbs may cause widespread and long-lasting
power outages. Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the Thursday morning and evening commutes.
Gusty winds could bring down tree branches. The dangerously cold
wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as
10 minutes. Wind chill values may fall to extremely dangerous
levels.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road conditions for
the state you are calling from can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.
Monitor the latest forecasts and warnings for updates on this
situation.
Persons are urged to stay indoors until conditions improve. If you
must go outside, dress in layers. Several layers of clothes will
keep you warmer than a single heavy coat. Cover exposed skin to
reduce your risk of frostbite or hypothermia. Gloves, a scarf, and a
hat will keep you from losing your body heat.
Wrap pipes with insulation and seal windows to avoid loss of heat
from your home. Keep a slow steady stream of water running from
indoor faucets, and open cabinet doors to allow warm air to
circulate around inside pipes.
Keep pets indoors as much as possible.</instruction>
