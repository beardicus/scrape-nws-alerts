<headline>Flood Watch issued December 22 at 3:32PM EST until December 24 at 4:00AM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>.A strong storm system is expected to spread rain northeast
overnight and become heavy at times by Friday morning. By Friday
afternoon, 1 to 3 inches of rain is expected with higher amounts
possible in the higher terrain. The heaviest rain will occur from
late morning through the early afternoon time frame, increasing the
risk for flash flooding if the heavy precipitation is able to remain
in one spot or pass over the same area in several batches. The
snowpack along the coastal plain will be significantly reduced if
not completely melted out. For interior and mountain regions, the
snowpack will hold but will be reduced and result in some additional
runoff. This rain in combination with some snow melt and already
high stream levels will cause rapid rises especially on small
streams and creeks. Minor river flooding is possible as well which
will continue even after the rain moves out. Cold temperatures on
the backside of the storm system could cause flooded areas to freeze
in place.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY MORNING THROUGH
SATURDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flash, urban, and small stream flooding expected from
widespread heavy rain and snowmelt.
* WHERE...Portions of Maine, including the following areas,
Androscoggin, Central Interior Cumberland, Coastal Cumberland,
Coastal Waldo, Coastal York, Interior Cumberland Highlands,
Interior Waldo, Interior York, Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln, Sagadahoc,
Southern Franklin, Southern Oxford and Southern Somerset. Portions
of New Hampshire, including the following areas, Belknap,
Cheshire, Coastal Rockingham, Eastern Hillsborough, Interior
Rockingham, Merrimack, Northern Carroll, Northern Grafton,
Southern Carroll, Southern Grafton, Strafford, Sullivan and
Western And Central Hillsborough.
* WHEN...From Friday morning through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Expect widespread overland flooding that will cause major
disruptions to travel.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A storm system is forecast to bring 1 to 3 inches of rainfall
with the potential for locally higher amounts in the watch
area.
- Warm temperatures and heavy rain will support rapid
snowmelt which will add around an inch of additional runoff.
- Frozen ground and snow blocked drainage will exacerbate
flooding conditions. The total combined runoff will cause
rapid rises on small streams and creeks which could produce
locally significant flooding.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Travel in and out of the region could be significantly
disrupted due to flooding. Those living in areas prone to flooding
should be prepared to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
