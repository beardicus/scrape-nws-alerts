<headline>Wind Chill Warning issued December 22 at 9:12PM EST until December 23 at 5:00PM EST by NWS Wilmington</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM EST FRIDAY...
...WIND CHILL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM TO 5 PM EST
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Winter Storm Warning, heavy snow continuing.
Additional snow accumulations of up to two inches. Winds
gusting as high as 45 mph. For the Wind Chill Warning,
dangerously cold wind chills expected. Wind chills as low as
35 below zero.
* WHERE...Portions of Southeast Indiana, Northern Kentucky and
South Central and Southwest Ohio.
* WHEN...For the Winter Storm Warning, until 5 PM EST Friday.
For the Wind Chill Warning, from 1 AM to 5 PM EST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Patchy blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute. Gusty
winds could bring down tree branches. The dangerously cold
wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little
as 10 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Temperatures will drop sharply in the
matter of a few hours during Thursday night, rapidly falling
well below freezing, leading to the potential for a flash
freeze. This will cause travel conditions to rapidly
deteriorate.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
Avoid outside activities if possible. When outside, make sure you
wear appropriate clothing, a hat, and gloves.
