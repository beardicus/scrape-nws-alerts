<description>...GUSTY NORTHERLY WINDS WITH AREAS OF BLOWING AND DRIFTING SNOW
POSSIBLE FRIDAY...
Strong northerly winds will develop by early Friday morning across
the Anchorage Bowl as another round of arctic air moves over
Southcentral Alaska. The gusty winds are expected to peak Friday
afternoon before slowly diminishing late Friday night into
Saturday. The strongest wind gusts are expected along the Glenn
Highway from Birchwood and Eagle River to north and west Anchorage.
The combination of gusty winds and transportable snow already on
the ground will result in areas of blowing and drifting snow.
Visibilities may be reduced in blowing snow. The combination of
wind and cold temperatures may also result in wind chill values
between 10 and 20 below zero through Saturday. Please use caution
when traveling.</description>
