<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 AM TO 2 PM EST
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Some areas may have moderate flooding around the time of
the Friday morning high tide with one to two feet of water in
possible. Pockets of major flooding are possible with up to
three feet of water in some areas. Flooding may be prolonged and
continue into the early afternoon hours. Large, battering waves
driven by storm force southeasterly winds will lead to
significant splash-over and beach erosion.
* WHERE...In Maine, Coastal York, Coastal Cumberland, Sagadahoc,
Lincoln, Knox and Coastal Waldo Counties. In New Hampshire,
Coastal Rockingham County.
* WHEN...From 7 AM to 2 PM EST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Numerous roads may be closed. Low lying property
including homes, businesses, and some critical infrastructure
may be inundated and damaged. Shoreline erosion will occur with
damage to dune systems.
* ADDITIONAL TIDAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Widespread flooding of
locations near the waterfront expected, including some damage
to vulnerable structures. Numerous road closures expected. A
few locations could become isolated due to the flooding of
roads. Vehicles parked in vulnerable areas near the waterfront
will likely become flooded. A few evacuations may be needed in
the most vulnerable areas. There is significant threat to
property. Many coastal communities will experience damage.
Numerous structures will flood. Flood waters will extend well
inland in riverine tidal areas.
* WAVE IMPACTS...Expect moderate to locally significant beach
erosion with considerable erosion of protected dune structures
due to large breaking waves. Splash-over may lead to ponding
of water behind dune structures and result in flooding of
roads and vulnerable structures. Small rocks associated with
splash-over may result in damage to passing vehicles or
pedestrians.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
