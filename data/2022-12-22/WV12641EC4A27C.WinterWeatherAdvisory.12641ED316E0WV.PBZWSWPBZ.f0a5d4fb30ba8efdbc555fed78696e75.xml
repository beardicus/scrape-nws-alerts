due to rising temperatures. All other hazards remain in effect for
Friday through the holiday weekend. For the Winter Weather
Advisory, flash freeze and snow expected. Total snow accumulations
up to two inches. Winds gusting as high as 65 mph may result in
visibility reductions in blowing snow. For the Wind Chill Warning,
life threatening wind chills expected. Wind chills as low as 40
below zero.
* WHERE...Eastern Tucker County.
* WHEN...For the Winter Weather Advisory, from 1 AM to 1 PM EST
Friday. For the Wind Chill Warning, from 6 AM Friday to Noon EST
Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions
could impact the Friday morning and evening commutes. Very strong
winds could cause extensive damage to trees and power lines. The
life threatening, cold wind chills could cause frostbite on
exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes. Roads, and especially
bridges and overpasses, will likely become slick and hazardous.</description>
<instruction>Avoid outside activities if possible. When outside, make sure you
wear appropriate clothing, a hat, and gloves.
Keep pets indoors as much as possible.
Be prepared for slippery roads. Slow down and use caution while
driving. If you are going outside, watch your first few steps taken
on stairs, sidewalks, and driveways. These surfaces could be icy and
slippery, increasing your risk of a fall and injury.</instruction>
