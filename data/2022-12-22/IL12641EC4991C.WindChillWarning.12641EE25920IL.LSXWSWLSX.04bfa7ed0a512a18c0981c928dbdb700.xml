<instruction>Avoid outside activities if possible. When outside, make sure you
wear appropriate clothing, a hat, and gloves.
The rapid accumulation of snow will make travel extremely difficult,
if not impossible. If travel is necessary, be sure to exercise
extreme caution. If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food
and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road
conditions can be obtained at www.gettingaroundillinois.com.
Persons should delay all travel if possible. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution and be prepared for sudden
changes in visibility. Leave plenty of room between you and the
motorist ahead of you, and allow extra time to reach your
destination. Avoid sudden braking or acceleration, and be especially
cautious on hills or when making turns. Make sure your car is
winterized and in good working order.</instruction>
