<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued December 22 at 3:10AM EST until December 23 at 7:00AM EST by NWS Tallahassee</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM EST THIS AFTERNOON
THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM THIS
AFTERNOON TO 7 AM EST FRIDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM TO 1 PM EST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding
expected. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 5
to 7 feet expected in the surf zone. For the High Rip Current
Risk, dangerous rip currents expected.
* WHERE...Coastal Bay and Coastal Gulf Counties.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 1 PM this
afternoon to 7 AM EST Friday. For the High Surf Advisory, from
1 AM to 1 PM EST Friday. For the High Rip Current Risk, from 1
PM EST this afternoon through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Water levels will rise to between 1.5 ft and 2.5 ft
mean higher high water, which will result in minor inundation of
areas along the beachfront. At these levels, flooding affects
areas near the Panama City Marina as well as beach access points
in Panama City Beach. In addition to the coastal flood risk,
there is a risk of high surf and rip currents. Dangerous
swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
