<headline>Rip Current Statement issued December 22 at 5:02AM AST until December 26 at 6:00AM AST by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE SUNDAY
NIGHT...
* WHAT...Strong rip currents expected due to breaking waves
between 6 and 10 feet.
* WHERE...Beaches from the northwest to northeast coast of
Puerto Rico including Culebra...St.Thomas, St John and St
Croix.
* WHEN...Through late Sunday night.
* IMPACTS...Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A long period northerly swell will arrive
by tonight and into tomorrow, Friday, and deteriorate marine
and coastal conditions through the weekend. The high risk of
rip currents may be extended to other beaches during the
weekend. A High Surf Advisory may also be required through the
weekend.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.</instruction>
