<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 22 at 8:36AM CST until December 22 at 9:00PM CST by NWS Little Rock</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM CST THIS
EVENING...
...WIND CHILL ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO NOON
CST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Dangerously cold wind chills possible. Wind chills
below zero are expected. For the Winter Weather Advisory, the
primary potential impact is for the potential of a fairly
widespread Flash Freeze. A Flash Freeze occurs when the ground
is wet, and the air temperature falls below freezing very
fast, resulting in a thin sheet of ice developing along all
previously wet surfaces. The ice is typically not very thick,
but even a very thin layer of ice is enough to wreck havoc on
the roadways.
* WHERE...Portions of central Arkansas.
* WHEN...From Thursday morning through Friday morning. The
timing will vary depending on the speed of the cold front. The
cold front will move from northwest Arkansas at 8 to 9 AM
towards Central Arkansas from noon through 2 PM, and through
eastern Arkansas from 3 to 5 PM. The flash freeze, if it
occurs, will occur approximately 30 to 45 minutes behind the
front.
* IMPACTS...Wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in
as little as 30 minutes. Rain showers are expected along and
out ahead of the cold front on Thursday. Immediately behind
the cold front, air temperatures will drop 20 to 25 degrees in
under an hour. Winds will shift from southwesterly to
northwesterly and increase dramatically. In the 30 to 45
minutes behind the front, if any roadways remain wet, they
will very likely freeze into a thin layer of ice, leaving
untreated roadways extremely difficult if not impossible to
travel safely.</description>
<instruction>Use caution while traveling outside. Wear appropriate clothing, a
hat, and gloves.
Know when the cold front is moving through your area, plan your
travel accordingly. Do NOT travel behind the cold front if you
don`t have to. Try to complete shopping before the front arrives
to ensure that you can get home safely.
If you are going to travel, pack a winter weather survival kit in
case you slide off the road or are otherwise stranded. Pack
multiple layers of clothing, pack a few layers of blankets. If
you have bottled water and ready to eat meals, pack those as
well.
Pack an extra power supply for your phone or other electronic
devices. If you have a road flare, have that in your vehicle in
case you are stranded after sunset so you can flag down help.</instruction>
