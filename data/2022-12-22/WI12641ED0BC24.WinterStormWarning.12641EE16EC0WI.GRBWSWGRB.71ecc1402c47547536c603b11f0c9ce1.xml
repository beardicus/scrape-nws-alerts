<description>...A MAJOR WINTER STORM WILL CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE AREA THROUGH THE
START OF THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND...
.An intense but slow moving storm system will bring a prolonged
period of wintry weather to the area through Friday night or
Saturday. Although the heaviest snow has ended in most areas,
additional snow is expected at times, especially in northern and
eastern Wisconsin. Heavy lake-effect snow is likely in Vilas County.
Northwest winds will increase significantly tonight, with gusts to
35 to 50 mph leading to widespread blowing and drifting snow tonight
through Friday night. Very cold air arriving on the gusty northwest
winds will drive wind chills to 15 below to 40 below zero.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM CST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Snow and blowing snow. Additional snow accumulations
between 1 and 4 inches, greatest in northern Oneida County. Strong
winds gusting to 35 to 45 mph tonight through Friday night,
resulting in widespread blowing and drifting snow.
* WHERE...Oneida County.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility in open areas. The
hazardous conditions could impact the Friday morning and evening
commutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The strong winds will drive much colder air
into the area. The Wind Chill Index is expected to be in the 20
below to 35 below zero range from tonight through Friday night.
Frostbite may occur in as little as 15 minutes.</description>
<instruction>Hazardous travel conditions are expected tonight through Friday
night. Consider avoiding travel during this period unless absolutely
necessary. If you must travel during this period, drive with extreme
caution. Consider taking a winter storm kit along with you,
including such items as tire chains, booster cables, flashlight,
shovel, blankets and extra clothing. Also take water, a first aid
kit, and anything else that would help you survive in case you
become stranded. Be sure your vehicle has sufficient fuel before
crossing open areas.</instruction>
