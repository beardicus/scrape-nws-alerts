<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued December 22 at 4:08PM EST until December 23 at 1:00PM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM TO 1 PM EST
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...One to two and a half feet, locally three feet of
inundation above ground level expected in vulnerable areas
near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...In Connecticut, Southern Fairfield, Southern New
Haven, Southern Middlesex and Southern New London Counties. In
New York, Southern Westchester County.
* WHEN...From 8 AM to 1 PM EST Friday.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Widespread moderate to localized major
flooding of vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline
is becoming likely, with 1 to 2 1/2 feet, locally 3 ft, of
inundation above ground level in low lying, vulnerable areas.
This would result in numerous road closures and cause
widespread flooding of low lying property including parking
lots, parks, lawns and homes/businesses with basements near
the waterfront. A few buildings and homes near the waterfront
could experience flooding. Vehicles parked in vulnerable areas
near the waterfront will likely become flooded. Flooding could
also extend inland from the waterfront along tidal rivers and
bays.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...3 to 5 ft breaking waves, particularly
facing Central and Eastern Long Island Sound, will result in
beach erosion and erosion of dune structures. Wave splashover of
dune structures and bulkheads is possible in spots, which would
cause flooding of roadways and vulnerable structures behind
protective structures and locally major inundation impacts.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The potential for major flooding (3 ft of
inundation above ground) on Friday morning will depend on gale
force southeast winds and resultant high wave action occurring
right through the time of high tide. If winds are weaker or
shift more to the south southwest, moderate flood levels (2 ft
of inundation) are more likely.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
