extreme caution. If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food
and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency. In Illinois, the
latest road conditions can be obtained at
www.gettingaroundillinois.com. In Missouri, the latest road
conditions can be obtained at traveler.modot.org/map or by calling
1-888-275-6636.
Persons should delay all travel if possible. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution and be prepared for sudden
changes in visibility. Leave plenty of room between you and the
motorist ahead of you, and allow extra time to reach your
destination. Avoid sudden braking or acceleration, and be especially
cautious on hills or when making turns. Make sure your car is
winterized and in good working order.
Avoid outside activities if possible. When outside, make sure you
wear appropriate clothing, a hat, and gloves.</instruction>
