<headline>Hard Freeze Warning issued December 22 at 10:16PM CST until December 25 at 10:00AM CST by NWS Jackson</headline>
<description>...HARD FREEZE WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM CST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Sub-freezing temperatures as low as 5 degrees
Fahrenheit in the north, mainly in the Highway 82 corridor, to
as low as near 15 degrees Fahrenheit in the south, mainly in
the Highway 98 to Highway 84 corridors, are expected.
* WHERE...Portions of southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana
and central, east central, north central, northeast,
northwest, south central, southeast, southwest and west
central Mississippi.
* WHEN...From midnight tonight to 10 AM CST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...A prolonged period of subfreezing temperatures may
cause pipes to burst and water main breaks to occur. In areas
of north-central Mississippi, damage to exposed pipes and
water main breaks are expected. Bitterly cold temperatures and
wind chills will result in hypothermia and become life-
threatening to those with prolonged exposure or without access
to adequate warmth.</description>
<instruction>Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
