<description>...A MAJOR WINTER STORM WILL CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE AREA THROUGH THE
START OF THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND...
.An intense but slow moving storm system will bring a prolonged
period of wintry weather to the area through Friday night or
Saturday. Although the heaviest snow has ended in most areas,
additional snow is expected at times, especially in northern and
eastern Wisconsin. Heavy lake-effect snow is likely in Vilas County.
Northwest winds will increase significantly tonight, with gusts to
35 to 50 mph leading to widespread blowing and drifting snow tonight
through Friday night. Very cold air arriving on the gusty northwest
winds will drive wind chills to 15 below to 40 below zero.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM CST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Snow and blowing snow. Additional snow accumulations of 10
to 16 inches over northwest Vilas County, and 4 to 10 inches
southeast through Saturday. Strong winds gusting to 35 to 45 mph
tonight through Friday night, resulting in widespread blowing and
drifting snow.
* WHERE...Vilas County.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be dangerous, especially Friday into
Saturday. Widespread blowing snow could significantly reduce
visibility. The hazardous conditions could impact the Friday
morning and evening commutes. Gusty winds could bring down tree
branches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The strong winds will drive much colder air
into the area. The Wind Chill Index is expected to be in the 20
below to 30 below zero range tonight through Friday night.
Frostbite could occur within 15 minutes.</description>
<instruction>Dangerous travel conditions are possible late tonight through
Saturday. Consider avoiding travel during this period unless
absolutely necessary. If you must travel during this period, drive
with extreme caution. Consider taking a winter storm kit along with
you, including such items as tire chains, booster cables,
flashlight, shovel, blankets and extra clothing. Also take water, a
first aid kit, and anything else that would help you survive in case
you become stranded. Be sure your vehicle has sufficient fuel before
crossing open areas.</instruction>
