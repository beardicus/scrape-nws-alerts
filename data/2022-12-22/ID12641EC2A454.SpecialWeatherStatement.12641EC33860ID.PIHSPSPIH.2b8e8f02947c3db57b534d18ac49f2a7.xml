<description>...WIND GUSTS UP TO 50 MPH AND AREAS OF BLOWING SNOW LEADING TO
VISIBILITY BELOW ONE MILE ALONG INTERSTATE 15 NORTH OF DUBOIS...
At 300 AM MST, downsloping northerly winds off the Continental
Divide are leading to areas of blowing and drifting snow along I-15
with strongest winds north of Dubois around Spencer. Wind gusts have
been observed as high as 50 mph which are reducing visibility below
one mile in some areas. Winds will remain elevated through the
morning hours subsiding throughout the day as conditions improve.
A Wind Chill Warning remains in effect for the affected area through
1200 PM MST today with wind chills as low as 55 below.
Locations impacted include...
Dubois, Spencer, Monida Pass and Humphrey.
Visibilities at times will be below one mile in this area of blowing
snow. If you are driving, slow down and be on alert for other
motorists. Low visibility shortens the amount of time you have to
react to situations.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time when traveling.</description>
