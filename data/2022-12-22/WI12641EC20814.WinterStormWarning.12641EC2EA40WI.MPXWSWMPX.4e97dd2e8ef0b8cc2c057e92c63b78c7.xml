<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued December 22 at 12:21AM CST until December 22 at 6:00AM CST by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...ACCUMULATING SNOW ENDING OVERNIGHT THEN A GROUND BLIZZARD AND
DANGEROUSLY COLD CONDITIONS THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...
...TRAVEL THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT COULD BE
IMPOSSIBLE AND LIFE-THREATENING...
.Winds will be relatively light through this evening. There
should be a break in severe winter conditions beginning in the
next few hours through early to mid Thursday. Then, strong
northwest winds gusting as high as 50 mph and dangerously cold air
will surge in Thursday afternoon through Friday night. Whiteout
conditions are expected during that time with travel becoming very
difficult or impossible. This event could be life-threatening if
you are stranded with wind chills in the 30 below to 45 below zero
range. Travel plans for late this week should be adjusted now. In
addition, heavy snow remaining on trees from the last storm and
strong winds arriving could result in tree damage and power
outages as temperatures drop below zero.
A Blizzard Warning goes into effect Thursday afternoon and
evening in areas west of the Mississippi River, with a Winter
Storm Warning east of the river through Friday night.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM CST EARLY
THIS MORNING...
...WINTER STORM WARNING FOR BLOWING SNOW AND REDUCED VISIBILITIES
TO GO IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM THIS EVENING TO 6 AM CST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the first Winter Storm Warning, light snow.
Additional snow accumulations of up to one inch. For the second
Winter Storm Warning, blowing snow expected. Winds gusting as
high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Pierce, Dunn, Pepin, Chippewa and Eau Claire Counties.
* WHEN...For the first Winter Storm Warning, until 6 AM CST
early this morning. For the second Winter Storm Warning, from
6 PM this evening to 6 AM CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute. The
dangerously cold wind chills as low as 35 below zero could cause
frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.</description>
