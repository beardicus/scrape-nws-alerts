<headline>Wind Chill Warning issued December 22 at 9:38PM EST until December 24 at 10:00AM EST by NWS Cleveland</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM FRIDAY TO
10 AM EST SATURDAY...
...WIND CHILL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM FRIDAY TO 10 AM
EST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Multi-hazard winter storm with a combination of strong
winds, very cold temperatures, snow, and blowing snow
expected. Total snow accumulations of 2 to 4 inches. Winds
gusting as high as 60 mph. Dangerously cold wind chills
expected. Wind chills as low as 30 below zero.
* WHERE...Portions of north central and northeast Ohio and
northwest Pennsylvania.
* WHEN...For the Winter Storm Warning, from 1 AM Friday to 10 AM
EST Saturday. For the Wind Chill Warning, from 4 AM Friday to
10 AM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility and potentially
cause hazardous travel. The hazardous conditions could impact
the morning and evening commute. Very strong winds could cause
extensive damage to trees, power lines, and blowing snow. The
cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as
little as 30 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A window of brief intense snowfall is
expected with a cold front between 1 AM and 5 AM Friday
morning. This front also brings a sharp temperature drop over
a matter of a couple hours, where temperatures above freezing
drop to the single digits through Friday morning. A flash
freeze is likely with this occurrence. Strongest winds and
greatest blowing snow potential will be Friday afternoon
through Friday night. From Friday through Sunday, a period of
almost 48 hours where temperatures remain in the single
digits. This combined with the strong winds would allow for a
long period of wind chills well below zero. Temperatures this
cold for an extended period of time will impact infrastructure
across the region with frozen pipes a concern.</description>
