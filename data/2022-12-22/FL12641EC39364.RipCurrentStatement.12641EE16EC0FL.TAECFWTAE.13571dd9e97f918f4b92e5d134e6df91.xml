<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 AM EST
FRIDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding
expected. For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip
currents expected.
* WHERE...South Walton County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 1 PM this
afternoon to 7 AM EST Friday. For the High Rip Current Risk,
from 1 PM EST this afternoon through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Water levels will rise to between 1.5 ft and 2.5 ft
mean higher high water, which will result in minor inundation
of areas along the beachfront. In addition to the coastal
flood risk, there is a high risk of rip currents. Rip currents
can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper
water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Water levels will be highest around the
time of high tide, which is this evening around 7 pm CT at
Panama City Beach. The threat for coastal flooding will end when
winds shift offshore by daybreak Friday.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
