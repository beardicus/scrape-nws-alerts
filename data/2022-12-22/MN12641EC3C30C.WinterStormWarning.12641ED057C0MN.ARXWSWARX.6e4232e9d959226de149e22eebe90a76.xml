<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued December 22 at 11:55AM CST until December 22 at 6:00PM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Dangerous Wind Chills and Whiteout Conditions Still Coming...
.Snow was pushing east of the area with new snow totaling about 3
to 5 inches. Northwest winds are on the increase across northeast
Iowa and southeast Minnesota, gusting to 30 mph already, causing
drifting snow and dangerous wind chills. Wind chill values in
southeast Minnesota are already 30 to 40 below zero.
Winds will increase even more tonight and remain very strong
through Friday night. The likelihood of 50 mph wind gusts has
increased in Wisconsin from Interstate 90 and north, prompting a
Blizzard Warning for Friday and Friday night. Whiteout conditions
and significant drifting are expected in areas, especially in
open, rural areas across parts of Wisconsin, southern Minnesota
and northeast Iowa. Gusts of 40 to 55 mph are expected depending
on your location.
With these dangerous wind chills, frostbite can occur in as
little as 10 minutes.
