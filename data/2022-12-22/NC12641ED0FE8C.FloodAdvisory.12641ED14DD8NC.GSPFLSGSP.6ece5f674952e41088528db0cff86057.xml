- At 1123 PM EST, gauge reports indicated minor flooding is
ongoing on North Second Creek with a stage of 12.7 feet. At
12 feet, North Second Creek is out of its banks up and
downstream of the gauge site on US 70, flooding adjacent
farmland and other low-lying areas. At 14 feet, North Second
Creek would flood adjacent farmland with several feet of
water, but the creek now appears unlikely to reach 14 feet.
