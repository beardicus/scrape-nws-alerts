<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM EST
FRIDAY...
...WIND CHILL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM TO 5 PM EST
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Wind Chill Warning, dangerously cold wind
chills expected. Wind chills as low as 30 below zero. For the
Winter Weather Advisory, snow continuing. Additional snow
accumulations of up to two inches. Winds gusting as high as 50
mph.

Central Ohio.
* WHEN...For the Wind Chill Warning, from 1 AM to 5 PM EST

* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Patchy blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute. Gusty
winds could bring down tree branches. The cold wind chills
could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 30
minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Temperatures will drop sharply in the
matter of a few hours during Thursday night, rapidly falling
well below freezing, leading to the potential for a flash
freeze. This will cause travel conditions to rapidly
deteriorate.</description>

wear appropriate clothing, a hat, and gloves.
Slow down and use caution while traveling.
