...WIND CHILL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM TO 5 PM EST
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Winter Storm Warning, combination of snow and

Southwest Ohio.
* WHEN...For the Winter Storm Warning, from 7 PM this evening to
5 PM EST Friday. For the Wind Chill Warning, from 1 AM to 5 PM

* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Patchy blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous

cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as
little as 30 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Temperatures will drop sharply in the
matter of a few hours during Thursday night, rapidly falling
well below freezing, leading to the potential for a flash
freeze. This will cause travel conditions to rapidly
deteriorate.</description>
