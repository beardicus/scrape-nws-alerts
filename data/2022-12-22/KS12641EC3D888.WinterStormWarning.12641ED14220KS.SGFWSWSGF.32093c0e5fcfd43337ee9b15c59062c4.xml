<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued December 22 at 12:10PM CST until December 23 at 12:00AM CST by NWS Springfield</headline>
<description>...WIND CHILL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST SATURDAY...
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT CST
TONIGHT...
* WHAT...For the Winter Storm Warning, moderate to heavy snow
expected. Total snow accumulations of one to three inches, up to
four inches locally. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph. For the Wind
Chill Warning, dangerously cold wind chills expected. Wind chills
as low as 35 below zero.
* WHERE...Portions of southeast Kansas. Portions of central, east
central, south central, southwest, and west central Missouri.
* WHEN...For the Wind Chill Warning, until Noon CST Saturday. For
the first Winter Storm Warning and second Winter Storm Warning,
until Midnight CST tonight.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the Thursday evening and Friday morning
commutes. The dangerously cold wind chills could cause frostbite
on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes. Visibilities may drop
below 1/4 mile due to falling and blowing snow. Whiteout
conditions are expected at times and will make travel treacherous
and potentially life-threatening.</description>
<instruction>Avoid outside activities if possible. When outside, make sure you
wear layered clothing, a hat, and gloves.
If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency. In Missouri, call
1-888-275-6636 for road conditions. In Kansas, call 5 1 1 for road
conditions.
Persons are urged to stay indoors until conditions improve. If you
must go outside, dress in layers. Several layers of clothes will
keep you warmer than a single heavy coat. Cover exposed skin to
reduce your risk of frostbite or hypothermia. Gloves, a scarf, and a
hat will keep you from losing your body heat.</instruction>
