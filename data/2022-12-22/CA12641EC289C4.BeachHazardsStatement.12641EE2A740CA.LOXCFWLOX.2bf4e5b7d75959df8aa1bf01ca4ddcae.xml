<description>...HIGHEST TIDES OF THE YEAR...OR KING TIDES...WILL CAUSE PERIODS
OF MINOR TIDAL OVERFLOWS AND INCREASED RIP CURRENT ACTIVITY EARLY
FRIDAY THROUGH MIDDAY SATURDAY...
.The highest astronomical tides of the year, or King Tides, will
affect areas beaches and coastlines the next several mornings
when high tide is forecast to occur. King tides have historically
resulted in the minor flooding of beach walkways and normal dry
beach areas and increased rip current activity. The period of
greatest threat of minor coastal flooding looks to be between
early Friday through midday Saturday.
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT
THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Dangerous rip currents and breaking waves due to
elevated surf of 3 to 6 feet expected. Abnormally high tides
around 7 feet are expected each morning between Friday and
Saturday. Minor tidal overflow is possible around the time of
morning high tide.
* WHERE...Santa Barbara County Southwestern Coast and Santa
Barbara County Southeastern Coast.
* WHEN...From late tonight through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Pooling of sea water is possible around high tide at
beach and harbor areas that is uncommon with normal tidal
ranges. Enhanced beach erosion is also possible. No
significant damage is expected. There is an increased risk of
ocean drowning due to increased rip current activity. Rip
currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Waves can
wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats
nearshore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Morning high tides of over 7 feet are
forecast for Friday and Saturday between 8 and 9 am local time.</description>
<instruction>Avoid flooded walkways and beaches. Remain out of the water due
to hazardous swimming conditions, or stay near occupied lifeguard
towers, if available. Rock jetties can be deadly in such
conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
