<description>...THREAT OF URBAN AND RIVER RIVER FLOODING STARTING FRIDAY NIGHT
THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK ACROSS WESTERN WASHINGTON...
An active weather pattern will bring a series of storm systems that
will bring moderate to heavy precipitation and a rapid warm-up late
in the week and especially over the weekend. While initial
precipitation may be as snow or freezing rain, a shift to a much
warmer air mass Friday night into Saturday will likely lead to rain
falling on existing snow. This could lead to some urban flooding
concerns as drainage systems may not be able to keep up with the
increased runoff from the rain and the melting snow. Additionally,
some rises on mainstem rivers may also result, but widespread river
flooding is not expected through Saturday night. One notable
exception would be possible minor flooding on the Skokomish in Mason
County by the end of the week.
Additional moderate to heavy rainfall early next week is expected as
a series of atmospheric rivers may take aim at the Pacific
Northwest. Each of these potentially intense systems are lined up to
impact the region every 24 hours or so. This could lead to
additional river flooding, especially with snow levels likely
remaining elevated with these warm and moist weather systems leading
to progressively higher flows through at least the first part of
next week. Confidence remains somewhat low in pinpointing any
particular basins for early next week due to the complex evolution
of the pattern and the uncertainty of the impact of snowmelt,
combined with heavy rain and warming.
The next update will be provided by 4:00 PM Friday, December 23.
Please monitor the latest river forecasts from the National Weather
Service for additional information.</description>
