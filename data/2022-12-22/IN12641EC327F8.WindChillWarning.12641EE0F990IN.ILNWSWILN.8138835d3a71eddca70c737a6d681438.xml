<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM THIS EVENING
TO 5 PM EST FRIDAY...
...WIND CHILL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM FRIDAY TO 4 AM
EST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Winter Storm Warning, combination of snow,
blowing snow, and wind expected. Total snow accumulations of 2
to 4 inches. Winds gusting as high as 50 mph. For the Wind Chill
Warning, dangerously cold wind chills expected. Wind chills as
low as 35 below zero.
* WHERE...Portions of East Central Indiana and West Central Ohio.
* WHEN...For the Winter Storm Warning, from 7 PM this evening to
5 PM EST Friday. For the Wind Chill Warning, from 1 AM Friday
to 4 AM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Patchy blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute. Gusty
winds could bring down tree branches. The dangerously cold
wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little
as 10 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Temperatures will drop sharply in the
matter of a few hours during Thursday night, rapidly falling
well below freezing, leading to the potential for a flash
freeze. This will cause travel conditions to rapidly
deteriorate.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
Avoid outside activities if possible. When outside, make sure you
wear appropriate clothing, a hat, and gloves.
