<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued December 22 at 4:08PM EST until December 23 at 1:00PM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 AM EST FRIDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM TO 1 PM EST
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, one to two and a half,
locally three feet of inundation above ground level expected in
vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline. For the
Coastal Flood Statement, up to 1/2 ft of inundation above ground
level expected in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and
shoreline.
* WHERE...Southwest Suffolk County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, from 3 AM to 1 PM EST
Friday. For the Coastal Flood Statement, until 3 AM EST Friday.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Minor flooding with this evening high
tide may not recede before the next high tide begins to come
in. Widespread moderate to localized major flooding of
vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline is becoming
likely, with 1 to 2 1/2 feet, locally 3 ft, of inundation above
ground level in low lying, vulnerable areas. This would result
in numerous road closures and cause widespread flooding of low
lying property including parking lots, parks, lawns and
homes/businesses with basements near the waterfront. A few
buildings and homes near the waterfront could experience
flooding. Vehicles parked in vulnerable areas near the
waterfront will likely become flooded. Flooding could also
extend inland from the waterfront along tidal rivers and bays.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...Along the ocean front, 10 to 15 ft breakers
(highest across eastern Long Island) will likely result in
widespread beach flooding and erosion during the times of high
tide. Areas of dune base erosion and localized overwashes are
likely as well.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Water levels will approach or touch minor
flood thresholds for this evening high tide. Water levels in
some spots may not fall below minor tonight before beginning to
increase lat tonight ahead of the Fri AM high tide. The
potential for major flooding (3 ft of inundation above ground)
on Friday morning will depend on gale force southeast winds
occurring right through the time of high tide. If winds are
weaker or shift more to the south southwest, moderate flood
levels (2 ft of inundation) are more likely.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
