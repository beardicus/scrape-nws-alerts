<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued December 22 at 4:08PM EST until December 23 at 11:00AM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 AM EST FRIDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 5 AM TO 11 AM EST
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, one to two and a half
feet, locally three feet of inundation above ground level
expected in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline.
For the Coastal Flood Statement, up to 1/2 ft of inundation
above ground level expected in vulnerable areas near the
waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...Southern Nassau County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, from 5 AM to 11 AM EST
Friday. For the Coastal Flood Statement, until 3 AM EST Friday.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Localized minor flooding with this
evening high tide. Widespread moderate to localized major
flooding of vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline
is becoming likely, with 1 to 2 1/2 feet, locally 3 ft, of
inundation above ground level in low lying, vulnerable areas.
This would result in numerous road closures and cause
widespread flooding of low lying property including parking
lots, parks, lawns and homes/businesses with basements near
the waterfront. A few buildings and homes near the waterfront
could experience flooding. Vehicles parked in vulnerable areas
near the waterfront will likely become flooded. Flooding could
also extend inland from the waterfront along tidal rivers and
bays.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...Along the ocean front, 6 to 10 ft breakers
along the Rockaways and 10 to 15 ft breakers along southern
Nassau County will likely result in widespread beach flooding
and erosion during the times of high tide. Areas of dune base
erosion and localized overwashes are likely as well.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The potential for major flooding (3 ft of
inundation above ground) on Friday morning will depend on gale
force southeast winds occurring right through the time of high
tide. If winds are weaker or shift more to the south southwest,
moderate flood levels (2 ft of inundation) are more likely.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
