<description>.A very cold airmass is in place over northeastern Colorado, and
breezy winds will continue to cause dangerous wind chill. Snowfall
is diminishing and should end by sunrise, but drifting and blowing
snow and snow covered, slick roads will impact the morning commute.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM MST THIS
MORNING...
...WIND CHILL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 AM MST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Snowfall diminishing, additional accumulations up to one
inch. Winds gusting as high as 60 mph. Dangerously cold wind
chills as low as 45 below zero.
* WHERE...Rocky Mountain National Park and the Medicine Bow Range,

Indian Peaks.
* WHEN...For the Winter Weather Advisory, until 9 AM MST this
morning. For the Wind Chill Warning, until 11 AM MST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the Thursday morning and evening commutes.
Gusty winds could bring down tree branches. The dangerously cold
wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as
10 minutes. Exposed skin may become quickly frostbitten or frozen.
Wind chill values may fall to extremely dangerous levels.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling. The latest road
conditions for Colorado can be obtained by calling 5 1 1 or by going
to www.cotrip.org.
The combination of wind and cold temperatures will create
dangerously low wind chill values. Avoid outside activities if
possible. When outside, make sure you wear appropriate clothing, a
