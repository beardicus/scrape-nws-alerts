<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM FRIDAY TO 7 AM EST
SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow and strong winds expected. Total snow
accumulations of 6 to 10 inches. Winds gusting as high as 60
mph. A rapid switch from rain to snow with sharply falling
temperatures into the teens and single digits will result in a
flash freeze on Friday. From Friday afternoon through most of
the weekend, very strong winds, lake effect snow, and blowing
snow will produce localized blizzard conditions.
* WHERE...Monroe county. Greatest snow accumulation across western
portions of the county.
* WHEN...From 10 AM Friday to 7 AM EST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Travel for the holiday weekend, including Friday, will
be very difficult to impossible at times. Areas of blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility with whiteouts and
localized blizzard conditions possible. Winds this strong could
cause tree damage and numerous power outages. Cold wind chills
as low as 10 to 20 below zero this weekend could cause frostbite
on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.</description>
<instruction>Widespread accumulating snow will create dangerous travel
conditions.
