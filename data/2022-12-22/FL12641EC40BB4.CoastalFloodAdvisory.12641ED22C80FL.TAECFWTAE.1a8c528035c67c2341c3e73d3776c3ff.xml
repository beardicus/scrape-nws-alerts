<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued December 22 at 2:41PM EST until December 23 at 7:00AM EST by NWS Tallahassee</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM THIS
EVENING TO 7 AM EST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding
expected. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of
5 to 7 feet expected in the surf zone. For the High Rip
Current Risk, dangerous rip currents expected.
* WHERE...Coastal Franklin County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 1 PM this
afternoon to 7 AM EST Friday. For the High Surf Advisory, from
1 AM to 1 PM EST Friday. For the High Rip Current Risk,
through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Water levels will rise to between 1.5 ft and 2.5 ft
mean higher high water, which will result in minor inundation
of areas along the beachfront. At these levels, flooding
affects areas near the Panama City Marina as well as beach
access points in Panama City Beach. The high surf will cause
minor beach erosion, especially around the time of high tide.
In addition to these other risks, there is a risk of high surf
and rip currents. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions
and localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the
best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
