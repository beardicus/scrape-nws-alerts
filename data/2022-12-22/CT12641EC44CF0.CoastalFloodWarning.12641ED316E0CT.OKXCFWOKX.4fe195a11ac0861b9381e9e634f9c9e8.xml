<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued December 22 at 4:08PM EST until December 23 at 1:00PM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM THIS EVENING TO
MIDNIGHT EST TONIGHT...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM TO 1 PM EST
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, one to two and a half
feet, locally three feet of inundation above ground level
expected in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline..
For the Coastal Flood Statement, up to 1/2 ft of inundation
above ground level expected in vulnerable areas near the
waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...Southern New Haven County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, from 8 AM to 1 PM EST
Friday. For the Coastal Flood Statement, from 9 PM this evening
to midnight EST tonight.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Localized minor flooding with this
evening high tide. Widespread moderate to localized major
flooding of vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline
is becoming likely, with 1 to 2 1/2 feet, locally 3 ft, of
inundation above ground level in low lying, vulnerable areas.
This would result in numerous road closures and cause widespread
flooding of low lying property including parking lots, parks,
lawns and homes/businesses with basements near the waterfront. A
few buildings and homes near the waterfront could experience
flooding. Vehicles parked in vulnerable areas near the
waterfront will likely become flooded. Flooding could also
extend inland from the waterfront along tidal rivers and bays.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...3 to 5 ft breaking waves, particularly
facing Central and Eastern Long Island Sound, will result in
beach erosion and erosion of dune structures. Wave splashover
of dune structures and bulkheads is possible in spots, which
would cause flooding of roadways and vulnerable structures
behind protective structures and locally major inundation
impacts.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The potential for major flooding (3 ft of
inundation above ground) on Friday morning will depend on gale
force southeast winds and resultant high wave action occurring
right through the time of high tide. If winds are weaker or
shift more to the south southwest, moderate flood levels (2 ft
of inundation) are more likely.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
