<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM FRIDAY TO
4 PM EST SUNDAY...
...WIND CHILL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM FRIDAY TO 10 AM
EST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Multi-hazard winter storm with a combination of strong
winds, very cold temperatures, snow, and blowing snow
expected. Total snow accumulations of 6 to 15 inches. Highest
snowfall amounts likely in Erie County, Pennsylvania. Winds
gusting as high as 65 mph. Dangerously cold wind chills
expected. Wind chills as low as 30 below zero.
* WHERE...In Ohio, Lake, Ashtabula Inland and Ashtabula
Lakeshore counties. In Pennsylvania, Northern Erie and
Southern Erie counties.
* WHEN...For the Winter Storm Warning, from 1 AM Friday to 4 PM
EST Sunday. For the Wind Chill Warning, from 4 AM Friday to 10
AM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility and potentially cause
hazardous travel. The hazardous conditions could impact the
morning and evening commute. Very strong winds could cause
extensive damage to trees, power lines, and blowing snow. The
cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as
little as 30 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A window of brief intense snowfall is
expected with a cold front between 2 AM and 6 AM Friday morning.
This front also brings a sharp temperature drop over a matter of
a couple hours, where temperatures above freezing drop to the
single digits through Friday morning. A flash freeze is likely
with this occurrence. Strongest winds and greatest blowing snow
potential will be Friday afternoon through Friday night. From
Friday through Sunday, a period of almost 48 hours where
temperatures remain in the single digits. This combined with the
strong winds would allow for a long period of wind chills well
below zero. Temperatures this cold for an extended period of
time will impact infrastructure across the region with frozen
pipes a concern.</description>
