<instruction>A Blizzard Warning means severe winter weather conditions are
expected or occurring. Blowing snow with strong winds and poor
visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout conditions,
making travel very hazardous. If you must travel, have a winter
survival kit with you. If you get stranded, stay with your
vehicle.
