<headline>Special Weather Statement issued December 22 at 8:21AM EST  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>A very cold arctic airmass will invade the area following a strong
frontal passage Friday morning. Saturday will be the coldest day,
with well below normal cold air remaining in place through at
least Monday. Friday and Saturday morning behind the front will
also be very windy, with an unusually high risk from wind chill
impacts, including frost bite and hypothermia.
The cold weather will result in high demand for electricity across
the region. Power outages may result from the heavy electrical
load. Those who require electricity for heating or medical
equipment should consider backup heat or electrical sources.
Take steps now to protect your property and health from the
extreme cold. If you go outside, wear several layers of loose
fitting, lightweight, warm clothing rather than one layer of heavy
clothing. Mittens are warmer than gloves. Wear a hat and cover
your mouth with a scarf. If driving, keep your gas tank near full
to avoid ice in the tank and fuel lines. Check your antifreeze and
windshield washer fluid levels. Be sure to carry a fully charged
cell phone.
If you are home, consider allowing indoor plumbing fixtures to
drip to allow water to trickle through pipes and inhibit freezing.
Use caution with space heaters in order to avoid fire or injury.
If emergency generators will be used, they must be situated
outdoors in well-ventilated areas to prevent carbon monoxide
poisoning. Also, remember to check in on family, friends, and
elderly neighbors who might be susceptible to the cold. Do not
forget about your pets and livestock. Make sure they have a source
of water that will not freeze and a warm place to take shelter
from the wind and cold.
Do not attempt to walk on frozen ponds, lakes, or streams, as the
ice will not be thick enough to support the weight, even of a
child.
A cold wave is defined as average daily temperatures 12 degrees or
more below normal mid-January average daily temperatures for 48
hours or longer. Normal mid-January average daily temperatures
are, for Asheville 37, Charlotte 41, and GSP 42. By definition it
follows that a cold wave is when the average daily temperature for
Asheville is 25, Charlotte is 29, and GSP is 30; or less.</description>
