<headline>Lakeshore Flood Warning issued December 22 at 11:38AM EST until December 24 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Buffalo</headline>
<description>...LAKESHORE FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 AM FRIDAY TO
7 PM EST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Significant lakeshore flooding expected. The lake level
at Buffalo may exceed 12 feet above low water datum which would
be more than 4 feet above flood stage.
* WHERE...Niagara, Erie, and Chautauqua counties.
* WHEN...From 7 AM Friday to 7 PM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...The very rapid rise in water levels will result in
SIGNIFICANT and possibly extensive lakeshore flooding and damage
along the Lake Erie and Upper Niagara River shores. Along the
Lake Erie shore, flooding is likely along Route 5 in Hamburg,
Buffalo Harbor, Canalside, Buffalo Riverworks, Dunkirk Harbor,
the Hoover Beach and Woodlawn areas in Hamburg, Old First ward
in South Buffalo, and other flood prone locations. Along the
Upper Niagara River, flooding is likely to affect Grand Island,
Cayuga Island, and beneath the North Grand Island bridge at the
Lasalle Expressway ramps. Very high wave action will also result
in significant shoreline erosion.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Temperatures in the teens and single
digits will result in freezing spray along the lakeshore, and
water from lakeshore flooding may freeze after the water levels
subside.</description>
<instruction>A Lakeshore Flood Warning means lakeshore flooding is occurring,
is imminent, or is expected to occur. For your safety, stay off
breakwaters, piers, rock outcroppings and beaches! Waves are
often larger than they appear and can easily wash you away.
Expect significant beach erosion and debris, local road closures
and extremely dangerous boating conditions.</instruction>
