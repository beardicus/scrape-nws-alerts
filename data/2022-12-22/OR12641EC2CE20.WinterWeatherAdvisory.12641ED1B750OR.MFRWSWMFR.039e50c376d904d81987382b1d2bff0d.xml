<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 22 at 3:28AM PST until December 23 at 1:00AM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...AREAS OF FREEZING RAIN AND WINTRY MIX POSSIBLE THURSDAY
AFTERNOON INTO FRIDAY MORNING...
.Cold arctic air could funnel down from the Willamette Valley,
into the far northern area of Douglas County. This cold air would
be in place while a warm front brings overrunning precipitation
into the area. This will bring the threat of freezing rain until
the cold air is scoured out by southerly winds expected late
Thursday. East of the Cascades, a more wintry mix is expected, but
pockets of cold air will maintain the possibility for freezing
rain, especially from the Chemult area northward.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM THIS
AFTERNOON TO 1 AM PST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Freezing rain could result a thin layer of ice.
* WHERE...Northwestern portions of Douglas County, including the
communities of Drain, Elkton, Curtain and Scottsburg. This
also includes portions of Highway 38 and I-5 from Rice Hill
northward.
* WHEN...From 1 PM Thursday to 1 AM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Ice will create slippery and hazardous road
conditions, which may impact the morning commute. This could
also create a slip hazard on walkways.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Ice accumulation is expected to be
minimal, but there is some uncertainty regarding exact amounts
because it largely will depend on how fast the cold air scours
out.
* View the hazard area in detail at
https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/map/?wfo=mfr</description>
<instruction>* Slow down and allow extra time to reach your destination.
* Carry tire chains and be prepared for snow covered roads and
limited visibilities.
* See https://www.tripcheck.com for latest road conditions.
* A Winter Weather Advisory for freezing rain means that periods
of slippery conditions will cause travel difficulties.</instruction>
