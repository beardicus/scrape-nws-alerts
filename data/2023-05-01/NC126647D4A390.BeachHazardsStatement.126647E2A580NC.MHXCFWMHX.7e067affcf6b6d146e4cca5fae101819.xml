<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued May 01 at 4:20AM EDT until May 01 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 AM EDT EARLY THIS
MORNING...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT SOUTH OF CAPE HATTERAS FROM
8 AM EDT THIS MORNING THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 5
to 8 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards Statement,
dangerous rip currents and strong longshore currents in the
surf zone.
* WHERE...South-facing beaches of Hatteras Island.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 5 AM EDT early this
morning. For the Beach Hazards Statement, from 8 AM EDT this
morning through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Strong longshore
currents will create dangerous swimming conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most likely time for strong rip
currents to occur is a couple hours either side of low tide,
which will occur around 11:00 AM Monday.</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
