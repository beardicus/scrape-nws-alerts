<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM EDT TUESDAY
THROUGH TUESDAY EVENING FOR SHACKLEFORD BANKS...
* WHAT...Dangerous rip currents and large breaking waves expected
in the surf zone for Core Banks and Shackleford Banks. For the
Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents and strong
longshore currents in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Core Banks and Shackleford beaches.
* WHEN...From 8 AM EDT Tuesday through Tuesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw
a swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom causing neck
and back injuries.</description>
<instruction>Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
