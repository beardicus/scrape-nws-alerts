<description>...Warm Temperatures this Week Increase Snow Melt and the Potential
for Flooding...
Warm temperatures are expected through Wednesday, which will
continue to melt low elevation and foothill snow across far western
Wyoming. High temperatures in the valleys will range from 55 to 65
each afternoon with a few readings into the 70s.
These warm temperatures could result in significant melting of low
elevation snow given the deep snowpack that still exists in the
valleys. As of Monday, May 1, many locations still had a snow depth
of 10 to 18 inches. Bedford and the Smoot area reported the greatest
snow depth of 22 and 34 inches, respectively. Rapid melting of this
snowpack could quickly raise the water levels in smaller tributary
creeks and streams in the Bear, Salt, and Snake River Basins of
Lincoln and Teton counties. Low-elevation snowpack in northwestern
Sublette County, such as around Daniel, could also melt
significantly with these warm temperatures, and feed local streams
and creeks in that basin as well.
Now would be the time to clear snow, ice, and debris from culverts
and other flow paths to allow runoff to flow away from buildings and
other vulnerable infrastructure. This could include moving deep snow
away from the foundations of buildings, relocating equipment to
higher ground, and moving livestock out of poorly drained or
low-lying areas.
Stay tuned for the latest river forecasts. Remember, if you
encounter a flooded roadway, turn around don`t drown. You never
know what road conditions are hidden under the water.</description>
