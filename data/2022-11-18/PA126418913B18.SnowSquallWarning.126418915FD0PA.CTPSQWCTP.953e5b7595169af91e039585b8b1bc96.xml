<headline>Snow Squall Warning issued November 18 at 3:06PM EST until November 18 at 4:00PM EST by NWS State College</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in State College PA has issued a
* Snow Squall Warning for...
Southeastern Cameron County in north central Pennsylvania...
Centre County in central Pennsylvania...
Central Clearfield County in central Pennsylvania...
Southwestern Clinton County in north central Pennsylvania...
* Until 400 PM EST.
* At 305 PM EST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from near Stevenson Dam to near Karthaus to Lecontes
Mills to Hyde to near Jeffries to Prince Gallitzin State Park,
moving east at 30 mph.
HAZARD...Flash freeze on roads. Intense bursts of heavy snow.
Gusty winds leading to blowing snow and rapidly falling

SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Dangerous and life-threatening travel conditions are
expected to develop rapidly in the warning area.
For those driving on Interstate 80, this includes areas between the
Penfield and Bellefonte exits, specifically from mile markers 115 to
160.
This includes Interstate 99 between mile markers 56 and 78, and near
mile marker 85.
Locations impacted include...
State College, Clearfield, Bellefonte, Park Forest Village, Keating,
Philipsburg, Woodland, Curwensville, Stormstown, Lemont, Houserville
and Pine Grove Mills.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads,
bridges, and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and
be prepared for a sudden loss of traction.
Slow Down! Rapid changes in visibility and road conditions are
expected with this dangerous snow squall. Be alert for sudden
whiteout conditions.
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.
Serious injuries and deaths may result from people exiting their
vehicles during a snow squall. Drivers may not be able to see you or
stop! If you have been involved in an accident or pulled to the side
of the roadway, quickly exit your vehicle and move as far away from
the roadway as possible ONLY when it is safe to do so. Do not stand
along or near the roadway, since approaching vehicles may be unable
to maintain control.</description>
