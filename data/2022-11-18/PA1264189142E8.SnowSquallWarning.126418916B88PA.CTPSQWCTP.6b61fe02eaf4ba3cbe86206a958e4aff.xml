<headline>Snow Squall Warning issued November 18 at 3:26PM EST until November 18 at 4:30PM EST by NWS State College</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in State College PA has issued a
* Snow Squall Warning for...
Northern Bedford County in south central Pennsylvania...
Blair County in central Pennsylvania...
Central Cambria County in central Pennsylvania...
Northern Huntingdon County in central Pennsylvania...
Somerset County in south central Pennsylvania...
* Until 430 PM EST.
* At 326 PM EST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from Blandburg to Gallitzin to Johnstown to Seven Springs
to Uniontown, moving east at 35 mph.
HAZARD...Flash freeze on roads. Intense bursts of heavy snow.
Gusty winds leading to blowing snow and rapidly falling
visibility. Wind gusts greater than 35 mph.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Dangerous and life-threatening travel conditions are
expected to develop rapidly in the warning area.
This includes the following Interstates...
The Pennsylvania Turnpike from mile markers 101 to 148.
Interstate 99 from mile markers 0 to 55.
Locations impacted include...
Altoona, Johnstown, Huntingdon, Somerset, Hollidaysburg, Tyrone,
Westmont, Windber, Bedford, Belmont, Portage and Roaring Spring.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads,
bridges, and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and
be prepared for a sudden loss of traction.
Slow Down! Rapid changes in visibility and road conditions are
expected with this dangerous snow squall. Be alert for sudden
whiteout conditions.
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.
Serious injuries and deaths may result from people exiting their
vehicles during a snow squall. Drivers may not be able to see you or
stop! If you have been involved in an accident or pulled to the side
of the roadway, quickly exit your vehicle and move as far away from
the roadway as possible ONLY when it is safe to do so. Do not stand
along or near the roadway, since approaching vehicles may be unable
to maintain control.</description>
