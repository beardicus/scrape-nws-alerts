Central Clearfield County in central Pennsylvania...
* Until 245 PM EST.
* At 158 PM EST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from S.B. Elliot State Park to near Rockton to
Punxsutawney to 11 miles southeast of New Bethlehem to 11 miles
northwest of Indiana, moving east at 20 mph.
HAZARD...Intense bursts of heavy snow. Gusty winds leading to
blowing snow and rapidly falling visibility. Wind gusts
up to 35 mph.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Travel will become difficult and potentially dangerous
within minutes.
For those driving on Interstate 80, this includes areas between the
Dubois Route 255 and Snow Shoe exits, specifically from mile markers
110 to 133.
Locations impacted include...

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Reduce speed and turn on headlights! During snow squalls, the
visibility may suddenly drop to near zero in whiteout conditions.
There is no safe place on a highway when a snow squall hits.
Visibility and traction are immediately lost in whiteout conditions,
making it difficult or impossible to slow down and avoid stopped
vehicles. Delay travel or safely exit the highway before the snow
squall arrives.</description>
