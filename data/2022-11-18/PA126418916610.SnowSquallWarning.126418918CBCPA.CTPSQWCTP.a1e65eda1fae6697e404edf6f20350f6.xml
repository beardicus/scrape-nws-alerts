<description>The National Weather Service in State College PA has issued a
* Snow Squall Warning for...
Central Huntingdon County in central Pennsylvania...
Juniata County in central Pennsylvania...
Mifflin County in central Pennsylvania...
Snyder County in central Pennsylvania...
* Until 515 PM EST.
* At 416 PM EST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from Whipple Dam State Park to Huntingdon to near
Williamsburg to Blue Knob State Park, moving east at 45 mph.
HAZARD...Flash freeze on roads. Intense bursts of heavy snow.
Gusty winds leading to blowing snow and rapidly falling
visibility. Wind gusts up to 35 mph.

within minutes.

Lewistown, Huntingdon, Selinsgrove, Mount Union, Burnham, Belleville,
Shamokin Dam, Milroy, Highland Park, Hummels Wharf, Middleburg and
Honey Grove.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads,
bridges, and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and
be prepared for a sudden loss of traction.
Slow Down! Rapid changes in visibility and road conditions are
expected with this dangerous snow squall. Be alert for sudden
whiteout conditions.
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.
Serious injuries and deaths may result from people exiting their
vehicles during a snow squall. Drivers may not be able to see you or
stop! If you have been involved in an accident or pulled to the side
of the roadway, quickly exit your vehicle and move as far away from
the roadway as possible ONLY when it is safe to do so. Do not stand
along or near the roadway, since approaching vehicles may be unable
to maintain control.</description>
