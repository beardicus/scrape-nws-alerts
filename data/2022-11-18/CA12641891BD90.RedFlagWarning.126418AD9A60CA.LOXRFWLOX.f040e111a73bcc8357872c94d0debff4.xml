<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM SATURDAY TO 10 AM SUNDAY
FOR THE MOUNTAINS OF LOS ANGELES AND VENTURA COUNTIES, SANTA
CLARITA VALLEY, SAN FERNANDO VALLEY, AND VENTURA VALLEYS DUE TO
GUSTY SANTA ANA WINDS AND LOW HUMIDITIES...
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM SATURDAY TO 10 PM
SATURDAY FOR THE VENTURA COUNTY COAST AND MALIBU DUE TO GUSTY
SANTA ANA WINDS AND LOW HUMIDITIES...
.Another moderate to locally strong Santa Ana wind event is
expected for tonight through early Sunday. Winds will quickly
ramp up this evening, then peak overnight into early Saturday
afternoon. Gradients and upper-level support are forecast to be
slightly weaker than the past event. As a result, peak winds will
likely be weaker with coasts and valleys of Los Angeles and
Ventura counties gusting 35 to 50 mph (with local gusts to 60 mph
in the foothills) and mountains gusting 40 to 60 mph (with local
gusts to 70 mph for favored peaks and canyons). Humidity levels
will initially start out above critical levels at the onset of
stronger winds this evening, but will lower by early Saturday
morning in the 12 to 20 percent range. Winds will slowly diminish
by Saturday night and Sunday morning, but will remain gusty in the
mountains and wind prone valleys of Los Angeles and Ventura
counties during this time, with gusts in the 30 to 45 mph range.
Humidity levels will likely be even lower Saturday night into
Sunday across the mountains and wind prone valleys of Los Angeles
and Ventura counties, with 8 to 15 percent readings becoming
common, resulting in critical red flag conditions likely
continuing into Sunday morning for these areas. There is increased
confidence that there will be widespread 6+ hours of critical
fire weather conditions for wind prone areas of Los Angeles and
Ventura counties with this event, resulting in the Red Flag
Warning issuance.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM TO 10 PM PST
SATURDAY FOR GUSTY NORTHEAST WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR
VENTURA COUNTY COAST AND MALIBU ...
* Winds...Northeast winds 20 to 30 mph with gusts peaking 35 to 50
mph. Strongest winds late tonight through early Saturday
afternoon.
* Relative Humidity...Humidity levels lowering to 12 to 20
percent by early Saturday morning, potentially falling to as
low as 8 to 12 percent by early afternoon.
* Impacts...If fire ignition occurs there could be rapid spread
of wildfire that would lead to a threat to life and property.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are expected shortly. Use extreme caution with anything that can
spark a wildfire. Residents near wildland interfaces should be
prepared to evacuate if a wildfire breaks out. See
readyforwildfire.org and wildfirerisk.org for information.</instruction>
