<description>...A LAKE EFFECT SNOW BAND WILL AFFECT PARTS OF JEFFERSON AND LEWIS
COUNTIES...
HAZARDS...A lake effect snow band which can rapidly reduce visibility
to less than a quarter of a mile. This lake effect snow band is
producing extremely heavy snow at the rate of 2 to 3 inches or
more per hour.
LOCATION AND MOVEMENT...At 211 PM EST, a lake effect snow band was
across portions of Jefferson and Lewis counties. The northern edge
of the band was from Chaumont to Philadelphia with the southern edge
from Adams to Croghan. The lake effect snow band will remain nearly
stationary through 4 pm.
LOCATIONS IMPACTED INCLUDE...
Watertown, Fort Drum, Stony Point, Carthage, West Carthage, Clayton,
Adams, Dexter, Glen Park, Herrings, Adams Center, Cedar Point State
Park, Southwick Beach State Park, Henderson Harbor, Barnes Corners,
Redwood, Denmark, Sackets Harbor, Henderson and Black River.
This includes Interstate 81 between exits 40 and 49.
SAFETY INFO...
Use extra caution if you must travel into or through this lake effect
snow band. Rapid changes in visibility and potentially slick roads
may lead to accidents.
The snow will accumulate so rapidly that it will be extremely
difficult for the road crews to keep the roads clear.
