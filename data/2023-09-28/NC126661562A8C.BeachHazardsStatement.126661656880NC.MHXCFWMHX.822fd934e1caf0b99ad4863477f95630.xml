<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued September 28 at 8:11PM EDT until September 29 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM 7 AM EDT FRIDAY THROUGH
FRIDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to one to two feet of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways. For the Beach Hazards Statement,
dangerous rip currents and large breaking waves expected in the
surf zone.
* WHERE...Northern Outer Banks and Hatteras Island.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 10 PM EDT this
evening. For the Beach Hazards Statement, from 7 AM EDT Friday
through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...Up to 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in a low threat of property damage. Some roads and
low lying property including parking lots, parks, lawns, and
homes adjacent to the waterfront will experience shallow
flooding. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw a
swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom causing neck and
back injuries.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most likely time for strong rip
currents to occur is a couple hours either side of low tide,
which will occur around 2 pm tomorrow afternoon.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
