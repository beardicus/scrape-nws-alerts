<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued September 28 at 12:29AM EDT until September 28 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Wakefield</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EDT
TONIGHT...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS
EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IS CANCELLED...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, up to two feet of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways. For the Beach Hazards Statement, a high
risk of rip currents.
* WHERE...Northampton County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, until midnight EDT
tonight. For the Beach Hazards Statement, through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Widespread flooding of vulnerable areas will result
in an elevated threat of property damage to homes and
businesses near the waterfront and shoreline. Water will be 1
to 2 feet above ground level in some areas resulting in a
sufficient depth to close numerous roads and threaten homes
and businesses. Flooding will extend inland from the
waterfront along tidal rivers and bays resulting in some road
closures and flooding of vehicles. Large breaking waves of 7
to 8 ft will result in dangerous surf conditions. Do not enter
or approach the water due to the risk of being swept away.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
