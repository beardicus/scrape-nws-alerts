        <headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued October 30 at 4:30AM EDT until October 31 at 5:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City NC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents
and large breaking waves in the surf zone. For the High Surf
Advisory, large breaking waves of 5 to 8 feet in the surf zone.
For the Coastal Flood Advisory, 1 to 2 of inundation above
ground level expected in low- lying areas near shorelines and
tidal waterways.

* WHERE...Northern Outer Banks.

* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, through this evening.
For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 AM EDT this morning. For
the Coastal Flood Advisory, from midnight tonight to 5 PM EDT
Friday.

* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only isolated
road closures expected. Dangerous swimming and surfing
conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep
even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
Dangerous shore break can throw a swimmer or surfer head first
into the bottom causing neck and back injuries.
</description>
        <instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.

Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.

Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.

Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
