        <headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued October 30 at 5:11PM EDT until October 31 at 6:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City NC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to 1 foot of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways. For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous
rip currents. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves
of 5 to 8 feet expected in the surf zone.

* WHERE...Ocracoke Island.

* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 6 PM EDT Friday.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, until 8 PM EDT this evening.
For the High Surf Advisory, from 6 AM to 6 PM EDT Friday.

* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only isolated
road closures expected. Dangerous swimming and surfing
conditions and localized beach erosion.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Strong westerly winds of 20 to 25 mph will
bring the threat of coastal flooding of up to 1 foot above
ground level along soundside locations. In addition, long period
swell from Hurricane Melissa will bring large surf with
significant wave run up along the beaches which may also result
in additional ocean overwash along the north end of Ocracoke
Island.
</description>
        <instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.

Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.

Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
