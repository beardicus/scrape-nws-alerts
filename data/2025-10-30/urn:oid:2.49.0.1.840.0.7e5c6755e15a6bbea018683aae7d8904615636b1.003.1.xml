        <headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued October 30 at 4:30AM EDT until October 30 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City NC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents
and large breaking waves in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood
Warning, 2 to 3 ft of inundation above ground level in low-
lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways. For the High
Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 5 to 8 feet in the surf
zone.

* WHERE...Hatteras Island.

* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, through this evening.
For the Coastal Flood Warning, until 8 PM EDT this evening.
For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 AM EDT this morning.

* IMPACTS...Numerous roads may be closed. Low lying property
including homes, businesses, and some critical infrastructure
will be inundated. Some shoreline erosion will occur.
Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach
erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw
a swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom causing neck
and back injuries.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The next high tide is 3PM Thursday. In
addition to the ongoing coastal flood warning, there is a threat
for soundside coastal flooding overnight Thursday into Friday of
1 to 2 ft above ground level as strong westerly winds of 20 to
25 kts and gusts of 30 to near 35 kts impact the area. In
addition to this, swell from Hurricane Melissa may also begin
impacting oceanside portions of Ocracoke as well on Friday and
this may bring a threat of additional rounds of oceanside ocean
overwash to the area as well. Threat looks to be slightly lower
than previous days so a Coastal Flood warning may not be needed
and an advisory may replace the ongoing warning later today
once we get past this afternoons high tide cycle.

        <instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.

Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.

Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.

Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
