<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT TONIGHT TO
9 AM CST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions expected. Total snow accumulations
of up to one inch. Winds gusting as high as 55 mph.
* WHERE...In Minnesota, Clay and Wilkin Counties. In North
Dakota, Cass and Richland Counties.
* WHEN...From midnight tonight to 9 AM CST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions as temperatures fall
rapidly. Widespread blowing snow will significantly reduce
visibility. The hazardous conditions could impact the morning
commute. Cold wind chills as low as 25 below zero could cause
frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Strong north winds combined with falling
snow will lead to whiteout conditions during the overnight
period and into Friday morning. These conditions could last
into early Friday afternoon if snow showers persist.</description>
<instruction>Travel should be restricted to emergencies only. If you must
travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded,
stay with your vehicle.
