<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued February 10 at 8:19PM AKST until February 12 at 9:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM AKST SATURDAY
ALONG THE KUSKOKWIM DELTA COASTLINE...
* WHAT...Blowing snow occurring. Total snow accumulations of 5 to
9 inches with the heaviest accumulations near Kipnuk. Northeast
winds of 20 to 30 mph with gusts as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Along the Kuskokwim Delta Coastline.
* WHEN...Until 9 AM AKST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on difficult travel conditions. Areas of
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility to one-half
mile at times.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Recent observations and webcams around the
Kipnuk area shows one half mile visibility with falling snow and
winds sustained around 30 mph causing the snow to blow around.
This is expected to continue through around 6 to 7 PM this
evening as the first system pushes through the area. Conditions
are expected to slowly improve during the evening, though, with
wind continuing. Therefore, blowing snow will continue through
the evening and overnight hours but with visibilities mostly
above one mile. The next round of precipitation moves in between
8 to 10 am Friday morning and continues through around 9 AM
Saturday morning. Falling snow in combination with gusty winds
will lead to visibilities as low as one half during this time
frame. Bethel may also experience blowing snow but the worst
conditions (one half mile) will be confined to the Kuskokwim coast.</description>
