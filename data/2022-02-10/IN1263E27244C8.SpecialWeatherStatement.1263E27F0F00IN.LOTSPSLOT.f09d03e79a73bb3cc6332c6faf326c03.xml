<description>...Quick Burst of Wet Snow Late Tonight...
A two to three hour period of wet snow is expected tonight across
northern Illinois and far northwest Indiana. This will move from
west to east over the area between 10 PM and 3 AM. While only a
short duration snow, it is likely to fall at a heavier rate,
resulting in quick accumulation of around an inch north of I-80 to
possibly to near two inches near the Wisconsin state line. In
addition, winds will be gusting to at least 30 mph during the
snow, and even with the wet composition of the snow will sharply
reduce visibility.
The snow will lead to slush-covered roads and briefly hazardous
travel during the overnight period. While at least some snow will
melt by daybreak Friday as temperatures warm into the mid 30s,
areas of slush are likely to remain on untreated roadways through
the morning commute. Plan on allowing some extra travel time.</description>
