<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST THIS
MORNING...
* WHAT...An elevated risk for hazardous sneaker waves expected.
These are waves that have an unusually higher run up on
beaches when compared to other observed waves.
* WHERE...Beaches along the southern Oregon Coast, including the
beaches of Douglas, Coos and Curry Counties.
* WHEN...Until 10 AM PST this morning.
* IMPACTS...Even during calm conditions, sneaker waves can sweep
up the beach without warning and knock unsuspecting people
over and pull them out to sea. Shock and hypothermia can occur
quickly in the cold Pacific waters. In addition, logs and
other debris can be lifted and carried by the waves, crushing
or entrapping unsuspecting victims underneath.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The sneaker wave threat will continue
through this morning, especially during the incoming high tide,
which occurs between 615 and 700 am PST.
