swimmers and surfers into rip currents, piers, jetties, and
other hazardous areas. It may sweep swimmers off their feet,
making it difficult to return to shore.

flooding during periods of heavy rainfall, high winds, or
other factors.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.
Caution should be used when in or near the water. Check with
lifeguards before entering the ocean for possible hazards you may
be swept into.</instruction>
