<headline>Red Flag Warning issued September 09 at 8:39PM PDT until September 09 at 9:00PM PDT by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>.Gusty winds combined with low humidities will bring critical
conditions to portions of fire zones 619, 620 and 280 overnight
with gusty winds and poor overnight recoveries, especially near
and at the ridges. Meanwhile, low humidities and gusty east winds
will continue over and near the Southern Oregon Cascades,
Siskiyous, and most of the westside, including the coastal
mountains, into Saturday evening. Additionally, strong winds and
low humidities are likely Saturday afternoon into Saturday evening
in the Shasta Valley and the higher terrain in Fire zone 280,
including the Mill and Mountain Fires. Lastly, very unstable
conditions with High Haines Indices of 6 are expected everywhere
except at the coast Saturday afternoon, which could lead very
quick fire growth.
...RED FLAG WARNING WILL EXPIRE AT 9 PM PDT THIS EVENING FOR EAST
WIND WITH POOR OVERNIGHT RH RECOVERY...
Although conditions will remain very dry overnight with the east
winds, the winds have diminished below critical limits, and the
Red Flag Warning will be allowed to expire. Please continue to do
your part and avoid causing sparks.</description>
