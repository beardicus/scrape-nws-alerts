<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued September 09 at 8:32PM EDT until September 10 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to two feet of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways and minor ocean overwash. For the Beach
Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents and large breaking
waves in the surf zone.
* WHERE...East Carteret County, and Northern Outer Banks,
Ocracoke Island and Hatteras Island.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 11 PM EDT this
evening. For the Beach Hazards Statement, through Saturday
evening.
* IMPACTS...Up to 2 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in a low threat of property damage. Some roads and low
lying property including parking lots, parks, lawns, and homes
adjacent to the waterfront will experience shallow flooding.
Minor dune overwash could also inundate some ocean adjacent
roads and properties. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore
break can throw a swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom
causing neck and back injuries.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most likely time for strong rip
currents to occur is a couple hours either side of low tide,
which will occur around 2 PM Saturday.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
