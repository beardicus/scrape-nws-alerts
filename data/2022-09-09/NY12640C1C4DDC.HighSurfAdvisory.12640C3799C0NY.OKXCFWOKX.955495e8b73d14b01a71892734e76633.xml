to 6 feet in the surf zone. For the High Rip Current Risk,
dangerous rip currents.

For the High Rip Current Risk, through Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Life-threatening rip currents are

the beaches should stay out of the surf. Rip currents can

<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
