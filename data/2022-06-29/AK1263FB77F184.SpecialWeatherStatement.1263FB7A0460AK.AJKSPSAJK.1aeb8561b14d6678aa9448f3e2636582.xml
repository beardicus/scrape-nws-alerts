<description>...HIGH RIVER LEVELS FROM WARM TEMPERATURES...
Previous record heat has produced significant snowmelt in higher
terrain. This has caused high water levels and near bankfull
conditions in rivers and streams throughout Upper Lynn Canal. This
includes the Chilkat, the Klehini, and Taiya Rivers. No flooding is
expected, with levels slowly dropping through Friday from cooler
conditions.
There are indications that very warm temperatures will move back
into the region late this weekend into early next week. This will
again raise water levels from snow and ice melt to near bankfull.
Check for updates through the week into the weekend.
For Chilkat River at Klukwan:
At 4:00pm the stage was 127.00 feet.
Flood Stage is 128.0 feet.
Forecast: A crest around 127.0 feet is expected around 4:00pm
Wednesday.
Impacts:
At 127.0 feet: This is bankfull stage, but water can encroach the
Haines Highway, south of Klukwan.  Note that the Chilkat River is
highly braided, if and when it shifts channels, our present bankfull
and flood stages will be outdated. Old datum 21.00 ft.
...
For Taiya River near Skagway:
At 4:00pm the stage was 15.83 feet.
Flood Stage is 16.5 feet.
Forecast: A crest around 15.9 feet is expected around 10:00pm
Wednesday.
Impacts:
At 16.1 feet: Portions of the Chilkoot Trail begins to inundate with
water.</description>
