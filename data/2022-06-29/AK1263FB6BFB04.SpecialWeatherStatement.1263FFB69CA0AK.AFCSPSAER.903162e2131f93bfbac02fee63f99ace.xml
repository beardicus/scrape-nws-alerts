AIR QUALITY ADVISORY
VALID TIME: Tuesday June 28, 2022 8:00 AM to Friday July 1, 2022
2:00 PM, advisory will be issued until end of the event.
TIME/DATE OF THE NEXT REPORT: Friday July 1, 2022 2:00 PM, if needed.
ADVISORY: Smoke from the fires in Central Alaska is starting to
make its way over the Alaska Range and into South Central Alaska.
Northern Susitna and Copper River Valleys are the first to see
impacts to smoke. Later today, smoke from the Southwestern fires
will begin to move east over Lake Iliamna and into the Cook Inlet.
Smoke will flow up the inlet into the lower Susitna Valley. South
Central Alaska will see an increase in smoke thru Wednesday
evening, wind directions change for Thursday, but the region will
continue to have impacts to air quality and visibility for the
next few days. Air Quality will vary between GOOD and UNHEALTHY
depending on wind flow and proximity to the fires. In the image
below, highlighted yellow area, is the forecasted impacted area
associated with this advisory. See the table below for more
guidance on the Air Quality Categories and Cautionary Statements.
Be aware that areas immediately downwind of any fire will
experience HAZARDOUS levels of smoke. Generally, worse conditions
occur overnight and during the early morning hours, as the
atmosphere cools and brings smoke to the surface. During the day,
surface heating will mix smoke and carry it upwards, temporarily
improving air quality.
SMOKE AND PUBLIC IMPACT: This is an area forecast, and as such is
a general forecast for portions of Southwestern Interior Alaska.
Smoke intensity will vary depending on precise location and local
wind flow patterns. Smoke concentrations will be such that they
could impact public health at times. It is advised that travelers
check local weather as smoke conditions may vary considerably from
one locality to the next. The most recent weather observations
for the surrounding impacted areas may be found on the Federal
Aviation Administration Weather Cams homepage at
https://weathercams.faa.gov/.
In smoke impacted areas, DEC advises people with respiratory or
heart disease, the elderly and children should avoid prolonged
exertion; everyone else should limit prolonged exertion. The
following table contains the cautionary statements for the Air
Quality for Particle Pollution.
