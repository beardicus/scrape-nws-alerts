* WHERE...Inland Berkeley County.
* WHEN...For the Freeze Warning, until 10 AM EDT this morning.
For the Lake Wind Advisory, until 8 AM EDT this morning.

<instruction>Boaters on Lake Moultrie should use extra caution since strong
winds and rough waves can overturn small craft.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
