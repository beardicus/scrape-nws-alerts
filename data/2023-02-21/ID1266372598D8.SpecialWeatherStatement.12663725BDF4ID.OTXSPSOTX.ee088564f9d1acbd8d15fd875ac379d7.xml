<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WILL AFFECT SOUTHEASTERN BOUNDARY AND CENTRAL BONNER
COUNTIES...
At 950 AM PST, a snow squall was located near Bonners Ferry, moving
southwest at 15 mph.
Winds in excess of 30 mph are possible with this squall along with
low visibility less than a half mile.
Locations impacted include...
Bonners Ferry, Naples and Elmira.
This includes U.S. Highway 95 in Idaho between mile markers 486 and
510.
Use extra caution if you must travel into or through this dangerous
snow squall. Rapid changes in visibility and potentially slick roads
are likely to lead to accidents. Consider delaying travel until the
squall passes your location.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time when traveling.</description>
