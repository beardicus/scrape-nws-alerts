EXPECTED...
.Arctic air will continue to slide south across the area late
today and tonight. After snowfall across northern and western
parts of the area today, snow will spread across the rest of the
area tonight and especially on Wednesday. The combination of heavy
snow and breezy winds will lead to difficult to nearly impossible
travel conditions across northeastern Wyoming and much of South
Dakota through early Thursday. The bitterly cold air will produce
wind chills as low as 25 to 40 below zero across the area late
tonight through late week.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 AM MST
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow. Additional snow accumulations of 4 to 8
inches. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Harding County and Perkins County.
* WHEN...Until 11 AM MST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The dangerously cold
wind chills as low as 35 below zero could cause frostbite on
exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.</description>
