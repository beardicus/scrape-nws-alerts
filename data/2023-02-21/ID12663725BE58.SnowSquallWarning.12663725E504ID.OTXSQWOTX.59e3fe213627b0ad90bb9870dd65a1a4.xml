<description>The National Weather Service in Spokane has issued a
* Snow Squall Warning for...
South central Boundary County in the Panhandle of Idaho...
Central Bonner County in the Panhandle of Idaho...
* Until 1145 AM PST.
* At 1044 AM PST, a dangerous snow squall was located near the north
end of Priest Lake and near Elmira, moving southwest at 15 mph.
HAZARD...Extremely poor visibility in snow and blowing snow. Wind
gusts greater than 30 mph.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Dangerous travel.
* This includes the following highways...
U.S. Highway 95 in Idaho between mile markers 473 and 489.
U.S. Highway 2 in Idaho near mile marker 28.
Locations impacted include...
Sandpoint, Ponderay, Kootenai, East Hope, Nordman, Hope, Colburn,

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra

to accidents.
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads, bridges
and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and be
prepared for sudden loss of traction.</description>
