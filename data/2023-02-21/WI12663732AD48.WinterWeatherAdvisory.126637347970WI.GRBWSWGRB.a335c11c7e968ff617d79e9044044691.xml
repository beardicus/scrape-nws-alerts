<description>...SIGNIFICANT WINTER STORM EXPECTED TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY...
.An intense winter storm is expected tonight through Thursday. The
first part of the storm will bring snow accumulations of 2 to 5
inches to much of the forecast area tonight. The second, and more
impactful part of the storm will arrive during the afternoon or
early evening on Wednesday, and continue through Thursday. Heavy
snow, strong winds and considerable blowing and drifting snow will
create near blizzard conditions at times, particularly across rural
and open areas. Widespread hazardous conditions for land and air
travel will develop. The combination of snow and wind may lead to
tree and power line damage, and sporadic power outages.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM CST
WEDNESDAY...
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM WEDNESDAY TO 6
PM CST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...For the Winter Weather Advisory, snow. Snow accumulations
between 2 and 4 inches.  For the Winter Storm Warning, heavy snow
expected. Total snow accumulations between 10 and 13 inches. Winds
gusting as high as 40 mph, producing considerable blowing and
drifting snow.

Marinette County Counties.
* WHEN...For the Winter Weather Advisory, until 9 AM CST Wednesday.
For the Winter Storm Warning, from 6 PM Wednesday to 6 PM CST
Thursday.
* IMPACTS...The strong winds and weight of snow on tree limbs may
