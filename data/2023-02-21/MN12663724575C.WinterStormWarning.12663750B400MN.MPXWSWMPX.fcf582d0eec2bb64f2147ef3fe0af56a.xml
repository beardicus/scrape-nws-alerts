<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued February 21 at 3:27AM CST until February 23 at 6:00PM CST by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...HISTORIC WINTER STORM SHOULD LEAD TO IMPOSSIBLE TRAVEL BY
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND EARLY THURSDAY...
.Two primary rounds of snow are expected. The first will arrive
this afternoon, moving from west to east, and tapering off early
Wednesday. Accumulations of 3 to 7 inches are expected with round
one. Round two is more widespread, and will begin Wednesday
afternoon and continue into Thursday with an additional 10 to 20
inches expected. Total snow accumulations will range from 15 to 25
inches, with the best chance for the higher end totals across
east central Minnesota and west central Wisconsin. This is
expected to reach the top 5 heaviest snow storms.
The worst conditions will be Wednesday evening through Thursday,
and a Blizzard Warning was issued for several counties in western
and central Minnesota during this time frame. Heavy snow will
combine with northeast wind gusts of 35 mph across the region, to
near 50 mph in western and central Minnesota. This will lead to
significant blowing and drifting snow with whiteout conditions in
open areas. Some drifts may be several feet deep, making travel
nearly impossible.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO
6 PM CST WEDNESDAY...
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM WEDNESDAY TO
6 PM CST THURSDAY...

* WHEN...For the Winter Storm Warning, from 6 PM Wednesday to 6
PM CST Thursday. For the Winter Weather Advisory, from noon
Tuesday to 6 PM CST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible with
drifting snow and reduced visibility. Gusty winds could bring
down tree branches. The cold wind chills as low as 25 below zero
could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 30
minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Significant drifting will occur due to the
heavy snow totals and strong winds. Drifts may be several feet
deep.</description>
