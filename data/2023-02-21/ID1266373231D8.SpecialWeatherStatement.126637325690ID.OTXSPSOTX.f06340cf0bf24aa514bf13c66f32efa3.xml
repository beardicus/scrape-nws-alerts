<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WILL AFFECT NORTHWESTERN KOOTENAI COUNTY...
At 405 PM PST, a snow squall was located along a line extending from
near Hauser to Coeur d`Alene. Movement was south at 5 mph.
Locations impacted include...
Coeur d`Alene, Post Falls, Hayden, Rathdrum, Dalton Gardens, Hauser,
Hayden Lake, Fernan Lake Village, Huetter, State Line and Beauty
Creek Campground.
This includes the following highways...
Interstate 90 in Idaho between mile markers 1 and 22.
U.S. Highway 95 in Idaho between mile markers 424 and 440.
Visibilities will drop quickly to less than a half mile in this
squall.
Use extra caution if you must travel into or through this dangerous
snow squall. Rapid changes in visibility and potentially slick roads
are likely to lead to accidents. Consider delaying travel until the
squall passes your location.
A rapid drop in temperatures will lead to the rapid formation of
black ice on area roadways. Black ice is nearly impossible to see and
roadways may appear wet. Please use extreme caution, especially on
bridges, overpasses and around curves. Allow plenty of stopping
distance and avoid braking suddenly.</description>
