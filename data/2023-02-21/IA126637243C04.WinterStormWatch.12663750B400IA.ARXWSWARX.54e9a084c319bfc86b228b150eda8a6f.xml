<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued February 21 at 2:57AM CST until February 23 at 6:00PM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Multi-Faceted and Complex Winter Storm From this Evening
Through Thursday...
.The heaviest snow arrives in two waves, first focusing tonight
in a narrow west to east band mainly north of a Rochester,
Minnesota to Black River Falls, Wisconsin line where some
locations could see 5 to 8 inches of snow. Snow amounts decrease
very quickly south of this line and locations south of Interstate
90 may see little to no snow with this first band.
This band of snow weakens but lingers though the morning on
Wednesday. There may be a short break in the snow midday, but with
increasing northeasterly winds, blowing and drifting snow will
become an increasing problem.
The second and stronger wave of snow arrives from south to north
Wednesday afternoon across the entire area. By the time the storm
ends late Thursday, an additional 8 to 12 inches of snow is
expected northwest of an Austin, Minnesota to Necedah, Wisconsin
line. Some locales may see even high snow amounts. Snow amounts
decrease quickly to the south of this line, but the threat for
freezing rain increases. Ice amounts over a quarter of an inch are
possible along and south of the Highway 14 corridor between
Wednesday evening and Thursday morning with the risk of tree and
power line damage amplified by winds gusting to 30 to 40 mph.
This will be a HIGHLY impactful winter storm with travel severely
impacted at times. With some adjustments in the storm track
possible, along with uncertainties in where the heavier snow bands
and favored wintry mix areas lie along the southern border of the
storm track, expect continued refinements to the forecast over
the next 24 to 36 hours.
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation possible. Total snow
accumulations of 3 to 7 inches and ice accumulations of up to three
tenths of an inch possible. Winds could gust as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...The best potential for impactful ice amounts will be
along and south of the Highway 14 corridor, with snowfall
amounts rapidly increasing north of this line.
* WHEN...From Wednesday afternoon through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Power outages and tree damage are likely due to the
ice and wind. Travel could be nearly impossible. Areas of
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute.</description>
