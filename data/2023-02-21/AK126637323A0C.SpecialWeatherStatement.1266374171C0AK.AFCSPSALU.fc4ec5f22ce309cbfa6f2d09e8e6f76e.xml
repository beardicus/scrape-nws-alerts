<description>...WARMER TEMPERATURES AND RAIN FOR THE KUSKOKWIM DELTA AND
ELEVATED WATER LEVELS POSSIBLE ALONG THE KUSKOKWIM DELTA COAST...
The first of two progressively warmer systems will move across
Southwest Alaska from west to east today and tonight, bringing
gusty southerly winds, coastal rain and interior snow.
For the most part, temperatures aloft are conducive to snow, but
onshore flow will likely warm the surface into the mid to upper
30s for coastal areas and hover around freezing for interior
valleys. A break in precipitation overnight, as well as a
reduction in wind speed, may allow some interior valleys to fall
back below or remain below freezing. On Wednesday, a second
system with much warmer air above the surface will spread mostly
rain across the region. Expect colder temperatures to return from
west to east on Thursday.
The development of strong southerly winds through the Kuskokwim
Bay Wednesday morning will bring elevated water levels with the
potential for water pushing up through cracks in the sea ice and
flowing over top of the shorefast ice along the south and west
facing shorelines. The greatest chance for elevated water levels
is along the coastline from Kwigillingok east. Winds will diminish
and shift westerly by late Thursday morning.</description>
