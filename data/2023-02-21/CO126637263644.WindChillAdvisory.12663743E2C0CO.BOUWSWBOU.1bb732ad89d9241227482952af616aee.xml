<headline>Wind Chill Advisory issued February 21 at 2:53PM MST until February 23 at 9:00AM MST by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>...A WINTER STORM ARRIVES THIS AFTERNOON INTO WEDNESDAY IMPACTING
NORTHERN COLORADO...
.Snow will become widespread in the mountains overnight and will
spread from north to south along the I-25 corridor behind a cold
front early Wednesday morning. Travel will deteriorate in the I-25
corridor north of Denver before rush hour Wednesday morning, and
snowy or icy roads will likely develop in the Denver metro area
around sunrise. The most likely times for accumulating snow in the
Front Range cities will be around the morning and evening rush hours.
In the mountains, snow will become widespread overnight and will be
heavy at times in the Rabbit Ears and Cameron Pass areas. In the
I-70 corridor the snow will initially be light, but heavy snow
showers are likely Wednesday afternoon.
Temperatures will also drop sharply, from around freezing in the
early morning hours to the single digits in the afternoon. Be
prepared for below zero wind chills by the end of the day Wednesday.
The snow will end Wednesday evening, but it will remain cold into
Thursday.
