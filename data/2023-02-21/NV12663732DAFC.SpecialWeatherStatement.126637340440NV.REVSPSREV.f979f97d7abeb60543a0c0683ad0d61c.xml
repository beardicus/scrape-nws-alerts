<description>...MUCH COLDER WITH LINGERING SNOW AND ICY ROADS TONIGHT...
...ACTIVE WINTER PATTERN CONTINUES THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK...
* TONIGHT: Much colder weather will settle across the eastern
Sierra and western Nevada tonight. Recent snowfall combined with
freezing temperatures may result in icy conditions on any
untreated sidewalks, roadways, or other paved surfaces. This may
result in slick conditions and travel impacts for the Wednesday
morning commute. Check with Caltrans and NDOT for the latest
road conditions and give yourself extra time to reach your
destination or avoid travel if possible.
* COLD TEMPERATURES: High temperatures through Friday will
struggle to get out of the 30s in even the warmest valleys, with
teens and 20s in the mountains. Overnight lows will dip in the
teens and single digits, with below zero values in colder
Sierra valleys. Blustery winds will make it feel even colder,
with dangerous wind chills in exposed areas of the high Sierra
dipping as low as -30 degrees. Be sure to protect vulnerable
populations as well as pets.
* ADDITIONAL PERIODS OF SNOWFALL: A cold and unstable airmass will
be in place this week behind the cold front. This will allow for
hit and miss snow showers to develop Wednesday afternoon. While
accumulations will be on the light side, colder temperatures may
allow snow to stick more easily on roads which could create
travel impacts for motorists across the region. The next round
of snowfall will arrive on Thursday which will favor the Sierra
with most impacts expected along Sierra crest passes and
extending across western slopes. Be prepared for rapid changes
in visibility and road conditions. A third round of snow is
looking likely Friday into Saturday for the Sierra and western
Nevada, with the main focus in the Eastern Sierra from
Markleeville to Mammoth Lakes. This could provide the most
widespread impacts across the Sierra from the series of storms
this week. The active pattern continues into early next week
with a potential for another cold and wetter storm.</description>
