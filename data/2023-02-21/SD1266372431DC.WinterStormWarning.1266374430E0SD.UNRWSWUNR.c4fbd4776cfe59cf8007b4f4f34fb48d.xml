<description>...WIDESPREAD HEAVY SNOW AND DANGEROUSLY COLD TEMPERATURES
EXPECTED...
.Beginning this morning, the first of two rounds of snow is
expected to impact the area, primarily affecting far northwestern
South Dakota and higher elevations of the northern and central
Black Hills. More widespread heavy snow arrives tonight into
Wednesday, with heavy snow expected area-wide. The combination of
heavy snow and breezy winds will lead to dangerous or impossible
travel conditions across northeastern Wyoming and western South
Dakota through early Thursday. Dangerously cold Arctic air will
accompany the snow, with wind chills as low as 30 to 40 below zero
expected across the area Wednesday morning through at least
Thursday.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 AM MST
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow. Snow accumulations of 6 to 10 inches. Winds
gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Harding County and Perkins County.
* WHEN...Until 11 AM MST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The dangerously
cold wind chills as low as 35 below zero could cause frostbite
on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...After a period of snow this morning, a
break in snow is anticipated. Heavier snow will return
Wednesday morning. Blowing snow may cause hazardous travel
during the break in snowfall.</description>
