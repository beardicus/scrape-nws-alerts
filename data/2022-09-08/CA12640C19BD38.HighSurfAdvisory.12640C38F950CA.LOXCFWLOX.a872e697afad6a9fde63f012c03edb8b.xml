<headline>High Surf Advisory issued September 08 at 9:30PM PDT until September 11 at 2:00AM PDT by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 5 AM FRIDAY TO
2 AM PDT SUNDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 5 AM FRIDAY TO 2 AM
PDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding
expected. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of
5 to 9 feet with dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Catalina and Santa Barbara Islands.
* WHEN...From 5 AM Friday to 2 AM PDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely, around the time of
high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as
parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to
roads or structures is NOT expected. There is an increased
risk for ocean drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers and
surfers out to sea. Large breaking waves can cause injury,
wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats
near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Coastal Flooding will be most hazardous
during high tide. High tides of 7.0 to 7.5 feet are expected
Friday and Saturday around 9 PM, and 6.5 to 7.0 feet tide
Saturday around 10 AM.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
