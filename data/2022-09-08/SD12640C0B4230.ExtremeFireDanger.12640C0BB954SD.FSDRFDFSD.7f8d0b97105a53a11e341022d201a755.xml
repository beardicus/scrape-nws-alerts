<description>.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 427 AM CDT Thu Sep 8 2022
Expecting two rounds of near-critical and critical fire weather
conditions today for portions of the region west of I-29, with the
first round occurring out ahead of a cold front and the second on the
backside of the cold front. By the mid-morning hours critically low
relative humidity values will begin moving into portions of the
Missouri River Valley, with breezy southwesterly winds gusting up to
35 mph. Through the afternoon hours, a cold front will begin moving
into areas starting west of the James River Valley, which will act
to weaken surface winds until the front has finished passing
through. Behind the front, expect a rapid shift towards west and
then northerly winds. This will be the second round of concern as
dry air will also be present behind the cold front, with winds
gusting up to 35 mph.
Have upgraded portions of the watch to a full Red Flag Warning,
while also adding Bon Homme and Yankton counties, due to the hot,
dry, and breezy conditions expected. Did keep a couple counties in
the watch while also adding Hanson and Hutchinson counties for the
potential of Red Flag conditions, with the main concern being how
far eastward the dry air is able to get. While there will be a
couple periods where wind speeds will reach criteria, just not sure
if red flag conditions will be able to sustain themselves long
enough to warrant the upgrade at this time. With fuels west of I-29
certainly cured enough, the next shift will need to monitor new
model data and observations to see if a short-term upgrade is
warranted.
Debris burning is the number one cause of wildfires...so please be
careful with any use of fire.
...EXTREME FIRE DANGER...
The Grassland Fire Danger Index will reach the extreme category
this afternoon. Extreme weather conditions and very low
moisture content of grasses, and other dry organic material
on the ground, indicate that critical burning conditions exist.
All fires have the potential to become large and spread quickly,
becoming erratic with extreme behavioral characteristics.
No outdoor burning should take place.
OUTLOOK FOR FRIDAY AFTERNOON...The Grassland Fire Danger Index
will reach the moderate category.
The grassland fire danger product reflects fire danger for native
grasses. It is not intended for cured agricultural crops, nor
will it reflect conditions in road ditches which have been mowed.</description>
