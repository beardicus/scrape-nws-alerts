<headline>Rip Current Statement issued September 08 at 3:35AM EDT until September 09 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH FRIDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Southwest Suffolk and Southeast Suffolk Counties.
* WHEN...Through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...Life-threatening rip currents are likely for all
people entering the surf zone. Anyone visiting the beaches
should stay out of the surf. Rip currents can sweep even the
best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Dangerous rip currents are likely to continue
this weekend as energetic swells from distant Tropical Cyclone Earl
affect our shoreline.</description>
<instruction>If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
