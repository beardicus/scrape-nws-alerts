For the Beach Hazards Statement, through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...Up to 2 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in some areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in an elevated threat of property damage. Flooding
will extend inland from the waterfront threatening some homes
and businesses. Some road closures and flooding of vehicles will
be possible. High tide is around 730 PM Friday. Rip currents
can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper

currents to occur is a couple hours either side of low tide,
which is around 1 PM Friday.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
