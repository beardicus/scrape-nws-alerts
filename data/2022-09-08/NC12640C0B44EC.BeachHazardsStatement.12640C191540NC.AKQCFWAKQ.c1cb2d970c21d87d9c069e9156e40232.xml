<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO
10 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, up to one foot of
inundation above ground level expected in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways. For the Beach Hazards Statement,
a high risk of rip currents and rough nearshore surf.
* WHERE...Eastern Currituck County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, from 4 PM this afternoon
to 10 PM EDT this evening. For the Beach Hazards Statement,
through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Widespread flooding of vulnerable areas will result in
an elevated threat of property damage to homes and businesses
near the waterfront and shoreline. Water will be 1 to 2 feet
above ground level in some areas resulting in a sufficient depth
to close numerous roads and threaten homes and businesses.
Flooding will extend inland from the waterfront along tidal
rivers and bays resulting in some road closures and flooding of
vehicles. In addition, breaking waves of 5 to 6 ft will result
in rough surf conditions and a high risk of rip currents.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
