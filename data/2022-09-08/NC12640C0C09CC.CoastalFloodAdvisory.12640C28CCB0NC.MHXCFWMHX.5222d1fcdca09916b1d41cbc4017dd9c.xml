<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM EDT
FRIDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to 2 feet of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways. For the Beach Hazards
Statement, dangerous rip currents and large breaking waves
expected in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Northern Outer Banks and Hatteras Island.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 11 PM EDT Friday.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, from 8 AM EDT this morning
through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Up to 2 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in some areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in an elevated threat of property damage. Flooding
will extend inland from the waterfront threatening some homes
and businesses. Some road closures and flooding of vehicles
will be possible. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore
break can throw a swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom
causing neck and back injuries.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most likely time for strong rip
currents to occur is a couple hours either side of low tide,
which will occur around noon today.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
