<description>...Lingering Smoke Concerns through Sunday Morning, but a Change
to Cooler and Wetter Conditions Is Coming...
* Deeper southerly flow will push smoke from the Mosquito Fire
smoke northward later today. Conditions may deteriorate in the
Sierra Valley and from Truckee eastward to Highway 395 between
Stead and Doyle from late afternoon into this evening, with some
eastward spread across Pyramid Lake and into west central Nevada
overnight into Sunday morning. Elsewhere, improved air quality
conditions are expected through the rest of today, with fewer
smoke concerns from midday Sunday through Monday.
* An early season storm moves near the west coast this weekend,
bringing much cooler temperatures, and chances for rain and high
elevation snow Sunday through Wednesday. The west side of the
Sierra is favored for the highest liquid totals, with limited
precipitation chances into western Nevada until late Monday or
Tuesday. There are decent chances for wetting rainfall through
much of the Sierra near Tahoe and Alpine County, northeast
California, and far northwest Nevada over this four-day period.
* Higher passes such as Mt. Rose, Tioga, Sonora, and Ebbetts could
see light slushy snow accumulations, but overall travel impacts
will be minimal due to the recent warmth.
* It will be rather chilly Sunday through Wednesday with daytime
temperatures 15-20 degrees below average. Overnight lows could
drop into the 20s in colder Sierra valleys, so be prepared for
these chilly conditions if planning backcountry recreation
activities. Most western Nevada valleys should remain above
freezing, but some of the typical cooler spots could see
temperatures drop into the 30s by Monday or Tuesday morning,
which could affect cold-sensitive vegetation.</description>
