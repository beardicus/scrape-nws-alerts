<headline>Hydrologic Outlook issued September 17 at 2:14PM ChST  by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND STRONG GUSTS DUE TO NEARBY TROPICAL
DISTURBANCE POSSIBLE THROUGH TUESDAY...
This Hydrologic Outlook is for Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan in the
Mariana Islands.
A tropical disturbance is expected to develop within the eastern
sector of the monsoon trough just to the west of Agrihan by late
Sunday, with its convergence zone in the southeastern quadrant
supposed to strengthen as it drifts north into early next week.
Multiple deterministic and probabilistic models are in much better
agreement on the approximate location and wind swath of said
disturbance, along with higher rainfall trends projected through
midweek. The GFS and ECWMF also indicate favorable vertical
environmental profiles for heavy rainfall, with amounts between 2
and 4 inches with locally heavier amounts in excess of 4 to 6 inches
possible through Tuesday.
Localized flooding is possible in low-lying and poor drainage areas,
while flash flooding will be possible in areas of heaviest rainfall,
especially near steep terrain. Residents of the Marianas need to
closely monitor this developing situation as watched, advisories and
warnings could be issued later. If living near streams and rivers,
prepare to move items away from stream and river banks. Make sure
storm drains nearby are not clogged, especially in low-lying areas.
This outlook will be updated over the next few days with additional
information, or cancelled if the situation changes.</description>
