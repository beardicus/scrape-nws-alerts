SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
The outer bands of Tropical Storm Fiona continue to affect the local
islands, producing periods of moderate to heavy rainfall and strong,
gusty winds. At 8 AM AST (12 UTC), the center of the tropical storm was
located about 145 miles southeast of St. Croix. These periods of rain
will increase in frequency through the day as the system continues its
approach. The storm`s trajectory takes this system just south of the
islands today and tomorrow before moving northwest into the Mona
Passage.
The Tropical Storm Warning and Flash Flood Watch remain in effect for
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Hurricane Watch continues
for Puerto Rico and the local Caribbean waters and Mona Passage.
The main threat for this storm remains flooding rains. Rainfall
accumulations of 5 to 10 inches are expected across the islands, with
locally higher amounts. For southern and eastern Puerto Rico, amounts
locally of up to 16 inches are possible. The greatest risk is today
through Monday. This amount of rainfall will result in
life-threatening flash and urban flooding, as well as mudslides or
rockfalls and river flooding. Marine and coastal conditions are
deteriorating, and seas will build to around 15 feet through the
weekend. Maximum sustained winds to near 60 mph with higher gusts of 75
or more are expected for the islands.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts, especially across eastern and southern Puerto
Rico. Potential impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, arroyos, and
ditches may become dangerous rivers. In mountain areas,
destructive runoff may run quickly down valleys while
increasing susceptibility to rockslides and mudslides. Flood
control systems and barriers may become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.
Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with
underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.
Many road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having significant
impacts across the rest of the region.
* WIND:
Protect against dangerous wind having significant impacts across
Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Potential impacts include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
* SURGE:
Isolated storm surge flooding is possible mainly across southern
Puerto Rico. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts
across Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Potential impacts
include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
- If you are exceptionally vulnerable to wind or water hazards from
tropical systems, consider voluntary evacuation, especially if being
officially recommended. Relocate to a predetermined shelter or safe
destination.
- If evacuating away from the area or relocating to a nearby shelter,
leave early before weather conditions become hazardous.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to bring to completion all preparations to protect
life and property in accordance with your emergency plan.
If you are relocating to safe shelter, leave as early as possible. If
heading to a community shelter, become familiar with the shelter
rules before arrival, especially if you have special needs or own a
pet. Take essential items with you from your Emergency Supplies Kit.
Check the latest weather forecast before departing.
Failure to adequately shelter may result in serious injury or loss of
life. Always heed the advice of local officials and comply with any
orders that are issued. Remember, during the storm 9 1 1 Emergency
Services may not be able to immediately respond if conditions are
unsafe. This should be a big factor in your decision making.
Keep cell phones well charged and handy. Also, cell phone chargers
for automobiles can be helpful after the storm. Locate your chargers
and keep them with your cell phone.
If you are a visitor and still in the area, listen for the name of
the city or town in which you are staying within local news updates.
Be sure you know the name of the county or parish in which it
resides. Pay attention for instructions from local authorities.
Closely monitor NOAA Weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes to
the forecast.
