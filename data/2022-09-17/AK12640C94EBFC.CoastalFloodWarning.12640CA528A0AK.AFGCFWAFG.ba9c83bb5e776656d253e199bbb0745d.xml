<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM AKDT
SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Significant coastal flooding expected.
* WHERE...Southern Seward Peninsula Coast.
* WHEN...Until 10 AM AKDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Numerous roads may be closed. Low lying property
including homes, businesses, the airport, and other critical
infrastructure will be inundated. Some shoreline erosion will
occur.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...In Nome, water levels will be 8 to 11
feet above the normal high tide line. Areas near the mouth of
the Snake River and upstream, will also be inundated as water
backs up in the river due to the storm surge. The Belmont
Subdivision will be significantly impacted by flooding, as
will the Airport Terminal, and some areas of the runway may be
flooded. Streets on the west side of town may also be flooded.
The Nome/Council Road may be impassable as waves run well up
the beach. In Golovin, water levels will be 9 to 13 feet above
the normal high tide line. Golovin will see significant
inundation around the old runway and water may flood around
the fuel storage area and areas lower than the school. Highest
water levels are expected Saturday morning through Saturday
evening.</description>
