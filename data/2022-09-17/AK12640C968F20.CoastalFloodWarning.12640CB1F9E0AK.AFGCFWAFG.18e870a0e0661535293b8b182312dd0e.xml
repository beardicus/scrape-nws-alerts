<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued September 17 at 2:32PM AKDT until September 18 at 6:00PM AKDT by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AKDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Significant coastal flooding expected.
* WHERE...Eastern Norton Sound and Nulato Hills.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM AKDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Numerous roads may be closed. Low lying property
including homes, businesses, and some critical infrastructure
will be inundated. Some shoreline erosion will occur.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...From Shaktoolik to Stebbins, water levels
will be 8 to 12 feet above the normal high tide line. The
Shaktoolik Airport will be impacted. The high water may surround
some building in Shaktoolik. In Unalakleet, water will inundate
areas around the AC Store and Lodge. Flooding will also occur in
the north end of town and in low lying areas around the runway.
Roads and houses near the coast at Stebbins and St Michael will
be flooded. In Elim and Koyuk, water levels will be 12 to 18
feet above the normal high tide line. At Elim, the water and
sewer system may back up as high water and persistent southeast
winds push water up the creek and may contaminate the water
supply. At Koyuk, water will back up in the Koyuk River and
Creek with flooding around the store warehouse and other low
lying areas. Highest water levels are expected this afternoon,
gradually receding tonight and Sunday.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.</instruction>
