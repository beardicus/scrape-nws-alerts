degrees. Low temperatures on Friday and Saturday mornings as
warm as the upper 70s.

situation. Be prepared to drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-

vehicles under any circumstances. This is especially true during
warm or hot weather when car interiors can reach lethal
temperatures in a matter of minutes.</instruction>
