<headline>Flood Advisory issued June 07 at 2:31PM EDT  by NWS Miami</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 515 PM EDT THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of South Florida, including the following
counties, Broward and Palm Beach.
* WHEN...Until 515 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 228 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to slow
thunderstorms moving northeast from the western metro areas
of Broward County into the metro areas of Northeast Broward
County. Rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches are possible with
these thunderstorms as they move into the area during the
next couple of hours. This can cause some flooding issues
over the area due to the grounds being very saturated. If the
rainfall amounts increase more than forecast, then a Flash
Flood Warning may be needed for this area.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Fort Lauderdale, Pembroke Pines, Hollywood, Coral Springs,
Pompano Beach, Davie, Plantation, Sunrise, Boca Raton,
Deerfield Beach, Tamarac, Margate, Lighthouse Point,
Lauderdale-By-The-Sea, Lauderhill, Coconut Creek, Oakland
Park, North Lauderdale, Lauderdale Lakes and Dania Beach.
