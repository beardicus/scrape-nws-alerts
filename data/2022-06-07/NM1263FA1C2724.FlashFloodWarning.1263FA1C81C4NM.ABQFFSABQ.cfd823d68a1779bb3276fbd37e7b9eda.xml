<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued June 07 at 3:13PM MDT until June 07 at 5:45PM MDT by NWS Albuquerque</headline>
<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 545 PM MDT THIS
AFTERNOON FOR SOUTHWESTERN COLFAX AND NORTHERN MORA COUNTIES...
At 313 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms had ended
across the far eastern portion of the Cook`s Peak burn scar several
miles south of Rayado. However, potentially dangerous runoff from
earlier rainfall will persist for at least another hour or two.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar may result in significant
runoff and debris flow. The debris flow can consist of rock, mud,
vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,
highways, streets and underpasses as well as other poor
drainage and low-lying areas.
This includes the following streams and drainages...
Sweetwater Creek, Alona Creek, Ocate Creek and Banderitas Creek.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Runoff from rainfall will cause elevated water levels within
vulnerable drainages in and downstream of the Cook`s Peak fire burn
area.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
To report flooding, contact your local law enforcement agency and
your National Weather Service office when you can do so safely.</instruction>
