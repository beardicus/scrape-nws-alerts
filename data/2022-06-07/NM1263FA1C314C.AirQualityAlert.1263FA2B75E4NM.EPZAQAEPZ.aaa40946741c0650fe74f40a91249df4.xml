<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM MDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT... Localized areas of unhealthy air quality will continue for
areas mainly to the east and southeast of the Black fire in the
Gila National Forest, which continues to grow along its southern
periphery. Near surface smoke will be transported toward the east-
northeast this afternoon and into the evening. A decoupling of
winds tonight will allow residual smoke to settle into portions of
the Mimbres and lower Rio Grande valleys and drift toward the south
or southeast or down valley overnight into Wednesday morning.
Developing east and southeasterly winds will begin to push new and
residual smoke toward the west or northwest beginning midday or
early afternoon Wednesday. As a result, smoke transport will become
increasingly complex and changeable during the next 24 hours.
* WHERE... Near-surface impacts will be most significant and
widespread in far southeast Catron, northeast Grant, and much
western Sierra counties. This includes Kingston, Hillsboro, and the
I-25 corridor from near Elephant Butte and Truth or Consequences
to Caballo. Smoke may also expand as far south as Hatch and Radium
Springs. More details and latest air quality information can be
found at https://fire.airnow.gov
* WHEN... Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1pm MDT
Wednesday, June 8th.
The New Mexico Departments of Health and Environment has issued an
Air Quality Alert, until 1 PM MDT Wednesday.
An Air Quality Alert for Smoke has been issued.</description>
