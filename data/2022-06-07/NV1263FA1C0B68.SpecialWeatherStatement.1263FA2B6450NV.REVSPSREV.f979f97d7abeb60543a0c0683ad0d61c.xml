<description>...Heating Up This Week, Then Increasing Winds This Weekend...
* Summer`s first multi-day period of heat is projected Thursday
through Saturday. Highs well into the 90s in Western Nevada and
into the 80s for Sierra communities are expected, with potential
for some records on Friday. There is a chance of cities such as
Reno (15%) and Fallon (50%) of hitting 100 degrees on Friday.
Heat health impacts are possible, especially for vulnerable
populations and those outdoors for extended periods. Now is a
good time to ensure cooling systems are in good working order.
For more information, please see the Heat Advisory.
* Winds are expected to increase for the upcoming weekend, with
Sunday looking to be the windiest day. While not a major wind
event, widespread gusts on the order of 30-40 mph are possible
Saturday afternoon with gusts 40-50 mph Sunday. This would
cause rough water on lakes, tricky travel for high profile
vehicles, and increased turbulence for aviation. With dry air
expected, these winds could also cause increased concern for
rapid fire spread in vegetation that dries out due to the
upcoming heat.
* The hot temperatures will also result in minor rises on creeks
and streams in the Sierra from snowmelt. Slightly higher flows
of cold water could impact recreation and camping near streams,
however levels will be well short of any flood stages.</description>
