<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued April 09 at 4:08AM EDT until April 10 at 4:00AM EDT by NWS Melbourne</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE TONIGHT...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO
4 AM EDT TUESDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO 4 PM
EDT TUESDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding
expected. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves
building 6 to 9 feet expected in the surf zone tonight and
continuing through Monday night. For the Beach Hazards
Statement, a strong southward flowing longshore current and a
moderate risk of dangerous rip currents is expected.
* WHERE...Northern Brevard Barrier Islands and Southern Brevard
Barrier Islands Counties.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 4 PM this
afternoon to 4 AM EDT Tuesday. For the High Surf Advisory,
from 4 PM this afternoon to 4 PM EDT Tuesday. For the Beach
Hazards Statement, through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Some flooding of low-lying lots, parks and roadways
may occur near the shoreline. Only isolated road closures are
expected. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The high tide of most concern will occur
between 11 pm and 1130 pm tonight. The Brevard county coast is
vulnerable to wave runup in some areas given the loss of dunes
as a result of Hurricanes Ian and Nicole last autumn.</description>
<instruction>Onshore winds and above normal tides will combine to generate
flooding of low areas along the shore. Do not drive around
barricades or through water of unknown depth. Take the necessary
actions to protect flood-prone property.
High surf will affect the beaches in the advisory area, producing
localized beach erosion and dangerous swimming conditions.
Swimmers should remain out of the water due to large breaking
waves and dangerous surf conditions. Entering the surf is not
advised.</instruction>
