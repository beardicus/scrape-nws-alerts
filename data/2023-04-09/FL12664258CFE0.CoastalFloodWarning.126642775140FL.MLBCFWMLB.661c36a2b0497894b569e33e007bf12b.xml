4 AM EDT TUESDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO 4 PM
EDT TUESDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, significant coastal
flooding expected. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking
waves building 8 to 10 feet expected in the surf zone tonight
and continuing through Monday night. For the Beach Hazards
Statement, a strong southward flowing longshore current and a
moderate risk of dangerous rip currents is expected.
* WHERE...Coastal Volusia County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, from 4 PM this afternoon
to 4 AM EDT Tuesday. For the High Surf Advisory, from 4 PM
this afternoon to 4 PM EDT Tuesday. For the Beach Hazards

* IMPACTS...Coastal roads may be closed. Low lying property
including homes, businesses and some critical infrastructure
will be inundated. Significant shoreline erosion will occur.
Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach
erosion.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The high tide of most concern will occur
between 11 pm and 1130 pm tonight. The Volusia county coast is
especially vulnerable to wave runup given the loss of dunes and
sea walls as a result of Hurricanes Ian and Nicole last autumn.</description>
<instruction>Coastal flooding is expected with the next several high tide
cycles. Coastal residents in the warned area should be alert for
rising water, and take appropriate action to protect life and
property. If travel is required, do not drive around barricades or
through water of unknown depth.
High surf will affect the beaches in the advisory area, producing
localized beach erosion and dangerous swimming conditions.
Swimmers should remain out of the water due to large breaking
waves and dangerous surf conditions. Entering the surf is not
advised.</instruction>
