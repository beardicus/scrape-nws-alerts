<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued April 09 at 9:42PM EDT until April 10 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 AM EDT
MONDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, 1 to 2 feet of above
ground inundation. For the Beach Hazards Statement, strong
longshore currents in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Coastal Onslow County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 2 AM EDT Monday.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only isolated
road closures possible. Strong longshore currents will create
dangerous swimming conditions.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
