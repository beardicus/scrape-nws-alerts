* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, 1 to 2 feet of inundation
above ground level in low-lying areas adjacent to the beach. For
the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 6 to 9 feet in
the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip
currents and large breaking waves in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Hatteras Island.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 2 AM EDT Monday.
For the High Surf Advisory, until midnight EDT Monday night.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of beachfront lots near vulnerable dune
structures. Impacts to travel along NC 12 possible. Dangerous
swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw a swimmer or
surfer head first into the bottom causing neck and back
injuries.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
