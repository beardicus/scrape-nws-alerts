<description>...Critical Fire Weather Conditions Forecast For Tuesday; Near
Record Heat Also Possible...
.A very dry and warm air mass looks to develop across the High
Plains Tuesday. Due to the prolonged lack of precipitation and
multiple days of warm and gusty winds confidence is high enough
to at least warrant the issue of a Fire Weather Watch for
portions of the area. Temperatures will also be very warm for
this time of the year with highs currently forecast in the mid
80s resulting in some record highs for the area.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY MORNING
THROUGH TUESDAY EVENING FOR LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY AND GUSTY WINDS
FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONES 013, 027, 028, 041, 042, 253, AND 254...
* Affected Area...In Colorado, Fire Weather Zone 253 Kit Carson
and Fire Weather Zone 254 Cheyenne. In Kansas, Fire Weather
Zone 013 Sherman, Fire Weather Zone 027 Wallace, Fire Weather
Zone 028 Logan, Fire Weather Zone 041 Greeley and Fire Weather
Zone 042 Wichita.
* Winds...South 15 to 20 mph with gusts up to 30 mph.
* Relative Humidity...Around 10 percent.
* Temperatures...In the lower to mid 80s.
* Impacts...Any fires that start will have extreme fire behavior
and spread rapidly. Outdoor burning is not advised.</description>
<instruction>A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are forecast to occur. Listen for later forecasts and possible
red flag warnings.</instruction>
