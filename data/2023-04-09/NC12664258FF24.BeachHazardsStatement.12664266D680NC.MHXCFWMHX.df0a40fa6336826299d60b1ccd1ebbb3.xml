<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued April 09 at 5:29AM EDT until April 09 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM EDT
MONDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, Up to 1 to 2 feet of
inundation above ground level expected in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways. For the Beach Hazards
Statement, large breaking waves and strong longshore currents
in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Coastal Onslow County, including areas in North
Topsail Beach, the lower New River, and adjacent tidal creeks.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, around the times of high
tides this evening to 8 AM EDT Monday. For the Beach Hazards
Statement, through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Up to 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level
is possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways resulting in a low threat of property damage. Some
roads and low lying property including parking lots, parks,
lawns, and homes adjacent to the waterfront will experience
shallow flooding. Dangerous shore break can throw a swimmer or
surfer head first into the bottom causing neck and back
injuries. Strong longshore currents will create dangerous
swimming conditions.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
