<senderName>NWS Spokane (Eastern Washington and Northern Idaho)</senderName>
<headline>Flood Watch issued April 09 at 3:21PM PDT until further notice by NWS Spokane</headline>
<description>.Rain, moderate to heavy at times will fall across Northeastern
Washington and North Idaho Monday afternoon into Monday night.  One
to three inches of rain will be possible by Tuesday morning.
Additionally, the air mass will be unseasonably warm with
temperatures not falling below freezing until Tuesday night leading
to increasing snow melt.  The combination of excessive rain and snow
melt will result in sharp rises on creeks and streams, ponding of
water in fields, and potential for rockfalls in steep terrain.
On the larger rivers, delayed rises are expected as the runoff
works through the system though no flooding is anticipated given low
base flows currently in place.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH TUESDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of North Idaho, including the following counties,
Bonner, Boundary and Kootenai. Portions of Washington, including
the following counties, Ferry, Okanogan, Pend Oreille, Spokane and
Stevens.
* WHEN...From Monday afternoon through Tuesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of creeks,
streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations. Flooding
may occur in poor drainage areas.  Rockfalls will be possible on
steep slopes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rainfall amounts between one and three inches combined with
elevated snow melt will increase runoff and bring the
potential for minor flooding.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for additional flood
advisories or warnings for nuisance flooding. Those living in areas
prone to flooding should be prepared to take action should flooding
develop.</instruction>
