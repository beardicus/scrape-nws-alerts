<description>.DISCUSSION...
Gusty southerly winds are expected to expand across much of the
area today, as a warm front lifts north toward the Highway 14
corridor. Snow-free areas south of Interstate 90 will see
temperatures climb into the mid 60s to mid 70s this afternoon,
while strong mixing drives humidity levels as low as 15 to 20
percent. This combination of gusty winds and low humidity will
lead to Very High to Extreme fire danger from the lower James
River Valley, eastward across far northeast Nebraska and northwest
Iowa, and a Red Flag Warning is in effect from Noon to 8pm today.
South central South Dakota could see equally low humidity levels;
however, winds are expected to remain below critical thresholds.
Sunday and Monday should see lighter winds, with a chance of light
showers moving across areas along and east of the James River
Valley on Sunday.
Tuesday and Wednesday next week will bring an additional period of
elevated fire danger, as gusty south winds help temperatures warm
into the 70s to lower 80s. Exact minimum humidity levels are still
uncertain, though readings as low as 25 percent are possible in
some locations.
People are urged to exercise extreme care with respect to outdoor
activities that could cause grass fires. Avoid equipment that can
cause sparks near dry grass or brush. Do not toss cigarettes on
the ground. Report new fires quickly to the nearest fire
department or law enforcement office.
...EXTREME FIRE DANGER...
The Grassland Fire Danger Index will reach the extreme category
this afternoon. Extreme weather conditions and very low
moisture content of grasses, and other dry organic material
on the ground, indicate that critical burning conditions exist.
All fires have the potential to become large and spread quickly,
becoming erratic with extreme behavioral characteristics.
No outdoor burning should take place.
OUTLOOK FOR SUNDAY AFTERNOON...The Grassland Fire Danger Index
will reach the high category.
The grassland fire danger product reflects fire danger for native
grasses. It is not intended for cured agricultural crops, nor
will it reflect conditions in road ditches which have been mowed.</description>
