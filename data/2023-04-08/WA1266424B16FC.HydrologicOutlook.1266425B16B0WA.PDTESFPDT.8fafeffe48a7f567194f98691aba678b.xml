<description>...RISES ON STREAMS AND RIVERS EXPECTED DUE TO SNOWMELT AND RAIN...
Small streams and large rivers coming out of the mountains will see
rises over the weekend and through the first half of next week.
A weather system will approach the Pacific Northwest coast on
Sunday. Rain showers are expected to increase in area coverage
Sunday night and Monday especially in the area mountains such as the
Washington and Oregon cascades. The showers and periods of rain is
forecast to persist into the beginning of next week. Uncertainty
lies in where exactly the band of heaviest precipitation will occur
Monday and Tuesday, but expectation is that the largest rises in
rivers, streams, and creeks
will occur during this period.
While only a few gauges are expected to even approach bankfull, much
could change with the rain forecast between now and early next week.
As of now, however, flooding is not expected to occur with this
round of rainfall over the next several days.
This Hydrologic Outlook will be updated again Sunday with
the latest updates to the forecast.</description>
