<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued April 08 at 11:08AM AKDT until April 09 at 4:00PM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM AKDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Snow. Total snow accumulations of 4 to 11 inches highest
amounts East Anchorage/Eagle River/Hillside.
* WHERE...Anchorage.
* WHEN...Until 4 PM AKDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The low density snow
will easily blow around and reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A band of light snow will continue over
Anchorage through Saturday. The west side of the Bowl might see
a slight reprieve this afternoon and evening as drier air
filters in from the northwest; however, east Anchorage, the
Hillside and Eagle River/Glenn Highway corridor will likely see
an uptick in intensity during the late evening. A second wave of
snow will rotate through Sunday morning and continue into the
afternoon before tapering off by Sunday evening.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Slow down and use caution while traveling.
