<description>...ACCUMULATING SNOW LIKELY THROUGH THE WEEKEND...
A complex area of low pressure moving toward the region from the
Gulf of Alaska will bring accumulating snow to the eastern Kenai
Peninsula, mainly from Portage Valley to Moose Pass, for the
weekend. Light snow will persist through the day Saturday before
heavier snow develops Saturday night into Sunday morning. Snow
should taper off again on Sunday afternoon.
Although there is still uncertainty in the exact track and timing
of this system, 4 to 8 inches of snow is likely along the Seward
Highway from Girdwood to Moose Pass. The Moose Pass to Seward
stretch of the Seward highway should see about 3 to 6 inches.
Highest amounts should be from from Portage Valley to Whittier
with around 12 inches of accumulation. Blowing snow may reduce
visibility under a mile at times in Portage Valley and Whittier on
Sunday.
Visibility may also be reduced at times Sunday across the rest of
the area due to the snowfall and increasing northwesterly winds.
