<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued April 08 at 8:17PM EDT until April 09 at 1:00AM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM EDT
SUNDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EDT MONDAY
NIGHT...
...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM EDT SUNDAY
THROUGH MONDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 8 to
12 feet in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Advisory,
localized ocean overwash and 1 to 2 feet of inundation above
ground level expected in low- lying areas near shorelines and
tidal waterways. For the Coastal Flood Watch, potential for
ocean overwash resulting in 2 to 3 feet of inundation above
ground level possible in low-lying areas adjacent to the beach.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents, large
breaking waves, and strong longshore currents in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Hatteras Island.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until midnight EDT Monday
night. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 1 AM EDT Sunday.
For the Coastal Flood Watch, from 8 AM EDT Sunday through
Monday morning. For the Beach Hazards Statement, through
Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...Numerous roads may be closed. Low lying property
including homes, businesses, and some critical infrastructure
may be inundated. Some shoreline erosion may occur. Dangerous
swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw a swimmer or
surfer head first into the bottom causing neck and back
injuries. Strong longshore currents will create dangerous
swimming conditions.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
