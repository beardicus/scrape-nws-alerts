<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued April 08 at 8:17PM EDT until April 10 at 8:00AM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM EDT
MONDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, Up to 1 to 2 feet of
inundation above ground level expected in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways. For the Beach Hazards
Statement, large breaking waves and strong longshore currents in
the surf zone.
* WHERE...Coastal Onslow County, including areas in North Topsail
Beach, the lower New River, and adjacent tidal creeks.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, around the times of high
tides this evening to 8 AM EDT Monday. For the Beach Hazards
Statement, through Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...Up to 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in a low threat of property damage. Some roads and
low lying property including parking lots, parks, lawns, and
homes adjacent to the waterfront will experience shallow
flooding. Dangerous shore break can throw a swimmer or surfer
head first into the bottom causing neck and back injuries.
Strong longshore currents will create dangerous swimming
conditions.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
