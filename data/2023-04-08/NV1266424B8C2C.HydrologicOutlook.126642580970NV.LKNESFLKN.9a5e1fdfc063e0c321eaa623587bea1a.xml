<description>...Small streams and creeks will experience higher flows due to
snowmelt across Humboldt County...
Warm temperatures and high elevation snowpack will lead to an
increase in snowmelt across portions of Humboldt county this
weekend. With high temperatures rising into the 60s today and the
70s by Sunday, the spring melt will be in full swing. As a result,
increased runoff will be seen in some of the streams and creeks in
Humboldt county, like Martin Creek in Paradise Valley, McDermitt
Creek near McDermitt, and the Quinn River near McDermitt are all
registering higher than normal flows on USGS river gages. The
streams will continue to flow as runoff increases. No flooding is
anticipated at this time, though outdoor enthusiasts should use
caution as the water is very cold and a person could be swept away
by the fast flowing water.</description>
