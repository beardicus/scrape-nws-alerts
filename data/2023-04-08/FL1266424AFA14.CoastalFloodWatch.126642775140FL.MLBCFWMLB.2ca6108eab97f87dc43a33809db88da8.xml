a runup of surf during several high tides, beginning with the 9

midnight on Tuesday morning. Large breakers, deadly rip currents
and moderate beach erosion will all be possible Sunday night
through Monday night.

* IMPACTS...Some roads may be closed. Low lying property including
homes, businesses and some critical infrastructure may be
inundated. Shoreline erosion will be likely.</description>
