* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to one foot of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking
waves of 3 to 10 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards
Statement, Strong north to south longshore current. Moderate rip

* WHERE...Coastal New Hanover County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 1 AM EDT Sunday.
For the High Surf Advisory, until 9 PM EDT Sunday. For the

evening.
* IMPACTS...Low-lying roads and locations along the Intracoastal
Waterway and adjacent tidal creeks may observe minor coastal
flooding. Check with local officials for any road closures or
impacts. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Longshore currents can sweep swimmers
and surfers into rip currents, piers, jetties, and other
hazardous areas. It may sweep swimmers off their feet, making
it difficult to return to shore.

average tide conditions. Additional locations may experience
flooding during periods of heavy rainfall, high winds, or
other factors.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Caution should be used when in or near the water. Check with
lifeguards before entering the ocean for possible hazards you may
be swept into.</instruction>
