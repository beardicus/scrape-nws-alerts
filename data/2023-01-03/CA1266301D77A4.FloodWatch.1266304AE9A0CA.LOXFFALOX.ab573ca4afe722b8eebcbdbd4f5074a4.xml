<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
THURSDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible within
the entire Watch area, with the greatest threat near and below the
Alisal burn scar and in urban areas.
* WHERE...San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties
* WHEN...From Wednesday late afternoon through Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Significant flash flooding and debris flows are
possible, especially in and below the Alisal burn scar. Excessive
runoff may result in flooding of creeks, streams, and urban areas.
While the risk of main stem river flooding is low, water flowing
through normally dry rivers may be a threat to some homeless
communities.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- An atmospheric river pushing through the region Wednesday
evening into Thursday morning will support periods of heavy
rainfall with rates up to around an inch per hour, prompting
concern for flooding and flash flooding across the region.
Rainfall totals of 2-4 inches will be common with 4-8 inches
expected in the mountains, highest across the Santa Lucia
mountains and Santa Ynez mountains east into south facing
interior Santa Barbara mountains.
