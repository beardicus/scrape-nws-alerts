<description>...FLOOD WATCH NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM CST THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Arkansas, Louisiana and east Texas, including
the following counties and parishes, in Arkansas, Columbia and

Winn. In east Texas, Sabine.
* WHEN...Until 10 AM CST this morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Numerous showers and thunderstorms containing locally heavy
rainfall will continue to shift east across South Central
Arkansas, much of North Louisiana, and the Lower Toledo Bend
Country of Deep East Texas through mid morning. Additional
rainfall amounts of around an inch is expected, with isolated
higher amounts up to 2 inches possible. Given the already
saturated grounds, additional flooding will be possible
across portions of the Watch area before the heavy rain exits
the region to the east around mid morning.
