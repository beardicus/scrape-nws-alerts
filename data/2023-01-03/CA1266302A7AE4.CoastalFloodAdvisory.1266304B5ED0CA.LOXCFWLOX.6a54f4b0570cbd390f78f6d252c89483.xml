<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued January 03 at 9:45PM PST until January 06 at 1:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM PST THURSDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM THURSDAY TO 1 PM
PST FRIDAY...
...HIGH SURF WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM THURSDAY TO
10 AM PST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking
waves of 12 to 16 feet with dangerous rip currents. For the High
Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 5 to 8 feet with
dangerous rip currents. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor
coastal flooding expected.
* WHERE...Ventura County Beaches.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Warning, from 6 AM Thursday to 10 AM
PST Friday. For the High Surf Advisory, until 6 AM PST
Thursday. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 4 AM Thursday
to 1 PM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely, around the time of
high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as
parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to roads
or structures is NOT expected. Powerful waves and strong rip
currents will pose an exceptional risk of ocean drowning and
beach erosion. Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash
people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near
shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Surf may diminish briefly tonight and
Wednesday morning, but will begin to increase Wednesday
afternoon. The best chance for coastal flooding is during high
tide. Tides peak Thursday morning and Friday morning at 8 feet
around 8 AM. Rip currents will become strong as the tides begin
to peak.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other water side
infrastructure.</instruction>
