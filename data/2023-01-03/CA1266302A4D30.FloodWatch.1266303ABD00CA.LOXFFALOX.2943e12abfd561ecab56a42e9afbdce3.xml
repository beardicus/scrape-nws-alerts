<headline>Flood Watch issued January 03 at 8:28PM PST until January 05 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY EVENING THROUGH
THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of southwest California, including the following
areas, Antelope Valley, Catalina and Santa Barbara Islands,
Central Ventura County Valleys, Lake Casitas, Los Angeles County
Beaches, Los Angeles County Inland Coast including Downtown Los
Angeles, Los Angeles County Mountains, Los Angeles County San
Fernando Valley, Los Angeles County San Gabriel Valley, Malibu
Coast, Ojai Valley, Santa Clarita Valley, Santa Monica Mountains,
Southeastern Ventura County Valleys, Ventura County Beaches,
Ventura County Inland Coast and Ventura County Mountains.
* WHEN...From Wednesday evening through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Significant flash flooding and debris flows are
possible, especially in and below recent burn scars. Excessive
runoff may result in flooding of creeks, streams, and urban areas.
While the risk of main stem river flooding is low, water flowing
through normally dry rivers may be a threat to some homeless
communities.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- An atmospheric river pushing through the region Wednesday
night into Thursday will support periods of heavy rainfall
with rates up to around an inch per hour, prompting concern
for flooding and flash flooding across the region. Rainfall
totals of 2-4 inches will be common with 4-8 inches expected
in the mountains, highest across south facing mountains of
Ventura County.
