<description>...Next Winter Storm Arrives Wednesday through Thursday...
* Winds across Sierra ridgelines will increase Wednesday afternoon
and peak overnight with gusts likely to exceed 100 mph. Winds
down on the valley floors do not look overly strong but typical
wind prone areas along Highway 395 and Highway 95 near Walker
Lake could see gusts above 40 mph Wednesday evening and night.
* Rain and snow return to the region Wednesday through Thursday
night. There will be some breaks, especially for areas east of
the Sierra Wednesday afternoon and evening between the warmer
and colder portions of the storm.
* Snow levels will be tricky with this storm and there may be a
period Wednesday afternoon when they rise to 6500-7500 feet in
the Sierra, but stay near 4000-4500 feet in western Nevada. This
is a situation where rain occurs around Lake Tahoe while snow or
a rain/snow mix occurs in western Nevada valleys. A cold front
will drop snow levels below 5000 feet Wednesday night in the
Sierra, but help lift snow levels into the 4500-5000 foot range
by mid-morning Thursday for western Nevada.
* Total snow projections for this storm range from 2 to 3 feet
along the Sierra crest and 6 to 12 inches for the Tahoe Basin
and foothills of the eastern Sierra, to several inches on
valley floors, mainly near and west of US-95.
* Snow is most likely to arrive at the tail end of the Wednesday
morning commute (around 8 am) for the Greater Reno/Sparks/Carson
City/Minden areas and continue through midday. Another period of
snow is expected late Wednesday night into early Thursday
morning, before snow begins to mix with rain below 5000 feet by
mid-morning. The Thursday morning commute is likely to be slick
and hazardous once again.
* If you have travel plans through the Sierra, prepare for winter
weather driving conditions ahead of time and try to avoid the
worst conditions. Several additional storms are lined up for the
weekend and into next week.</description>
