<headline>Flood Watch issued January 03 at 8:28PM PST until January 05 at 6:00AM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
THURSDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible within
the entire Watch area, with the greatest threat near and below the
Alisal burn scar and in urban areas.
* WHERE...A portion of southwest California, including the following
areas, Cuyama Valley, San Luis Obispo County Beaches, San Luis
Obispo County Inland Central Coast, San Luis Obispo County
Interior Valleys, San Luis Obispo County Mountains, San Miguel and
Santa Rosa Islands, Santa Barbara County Central Coast Beaches,
Santa Barbara County Inland Central Coast, Santa Barbara County
Interior Mountains, Santa Barbara County Southeastern Coast, Santa
Barbara County Southwestern Coast, Santa Cruz and Anacapa Islands,
Santa Lucia Mountains, Santa Ynez Mountains Eastern Range, Santa
Ynez Mountains Western Range, Santa Ynez Valley and Southern
Salinas Valley.
* WHEN...From Wednesday afternoon through Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Significant flash flooding and debris flows are
possible, especially in and below the Alisal burn scar. Excessive
runoff may result in flooding of creeks, streams, and urban areas.
While the risk of main stem river flooding is low, water flowing
through normally dry rivers may be a threat to some homeless
communities.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- An atmospheric river pushing through the region Wednesday
evening into Thursday morning will support periods of heavy
rainfall with rates up to around an inch per hour, prompting
concern for flooding and flash flooding across the region.
Rainfall totals of 2-4 inches will be common with 4-8 inches
expected in the mountains, highest across the Santa Lucia
mountains and Santa Ynez mountains east into south facing
interior Santa Barbara mountains.
