<senderName>NWS Monterey (The San Francisco area)</senderName>
<headline>Flood Watch issued January 03 at 9:17PM PST until January 05 at 10:00PM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>.A potent atmospheric river will begin to impact the region
Wednesday and continue into Thursday. This will bring substantial
rainfall to the San Francisco Bay Area and Central Coast on top of
already saturated soils. As a result look for rapid rises in area
creeks, streams, and rivers. Bankfull exceedance is possible. In
addition strong gusty winds will bring branches and trees down,
which may cause localized damming of water ways.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM PST WEDNESDAY THROUGH
THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Entire San Francisco Bay Area and Central Coast including:
Sonoma, Napa, Marin, Contra Costa, Alameda, San Francisco, San
Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, San Benito, and Monterey counties.
* WHEN...From 4 AM PST Wednesday through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water crossings may be
flooded. Storm drains and ditches may become clogged with debris.
Extensive street flooding and flooding of creeks and rivers are
possible.
