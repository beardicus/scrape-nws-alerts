<headline>Special Weather Statement issued January 03 at 5:49PM MST  by NWS Pueblo</headline>
<description>A narrow band of light to moderate snowfall has developed over
northern El Paso county and is drifting off to the south and east.
The NAM 4km Nest model has been resolving this the best and shows
this eventually moving into across areas of the lower Arkansas
River Valley later this evening and into the early morning hours.
Some of the soundings have also been displaying an abundance of
low level moisture later this evening in and around the Colorado
Springs area, which may allow for some patchy freezing drizzle to
develop. There could also be some areas of of patchy freezing fog
over the higher elevations from Monument Hill to the Palmer
Divide.
Use caution while driving from Monument and northward to the El
Paso County border, as roads may occasionally be slick and icy.</description>
