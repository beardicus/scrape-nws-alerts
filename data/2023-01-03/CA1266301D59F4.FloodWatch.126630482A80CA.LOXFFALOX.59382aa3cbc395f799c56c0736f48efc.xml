the entire Watch area, with the greatest threat near and below the
Alisal burn scar and in urban areas.
* WHERE...San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties.
* WHEN...From late Wednesday afternoon through Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Significant flash flooding and debris flows are
possible, especially in and below the Alisal burn scar. Excessive

While the risk of main stem river flooding is low, water flowing
through normally dry rivers may be a threat to some homeless
communities.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...

night into Thursday morning with support periods of heavy
rainfall with rates up to around an inch per hour, prompting
concern for flooding and flash flooding across the region.

expected in the mountains, highest across the Santa Lucia
mountains and Santa Ynez mountains east into south facing
interior Santa Barbara mountains.
