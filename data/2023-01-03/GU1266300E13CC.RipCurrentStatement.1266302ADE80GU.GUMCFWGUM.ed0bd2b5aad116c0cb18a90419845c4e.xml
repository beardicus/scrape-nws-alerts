AFTERNOON...
...HIGH RISK OF RIP CURRENTS THROUGH WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...

* WHERE...For the High Rip Current Risk, along east facing reefs. For

* IMPACTS...Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water. Contact with Indo-Pacific Man-o-
War, alive or dead, can cause extreme pain and may be fatal in
some cases.

risk high along east facing reefs through at least Wednesday

beaches on Guam, including Tarague beach. Man-o-War may still be
found on beaches and the waters of the Marianas.</description>
<instruction>Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.
Remain out of the water to avoid hazardous swimming conditions.</instruction>
