<headline>Flood Advisory issued April 10 at 8:12PM MDT until April 12 at 11:00PM MDT by NWS Billings</headline>
<description>.Snow melt from the base of the Little Snowies and Crazy Mountains
has resulted in minor flooding across portions of western Wheatland
County. Additional snow melt due to very warm temperatures through
Tuesday will likely push water levels on small creeks and streams
even higher.
...FLOOD ADVISORY FOR SNOWMELT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 330 PM MDT
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Small stream flooding caused by snowmelt continues.
* WHERE...A portion of central Montana, including the following
county, Wheatland.
* WHEN...Until 330 PM MDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding of small creeks and streams, low-lying
areas, and culverts. Rural roads and bridges may be washed out or
damaged. Livestock may become stranded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 804 PM MDT, Local county officials have reported flooding
along Lebo Creek south of Two Dot, and Haymaker Creek north
of Two Dot. A few rural roads have been washed out in spots.
Culverts are overflowing in some areas.
- Reports indicate flooding is mainly in the Two Dot and
Martinsdale vicinities, but the Harlowton area could see
small creeks flooding as well. Water levels may continue to
rise for another day or two due to very warm temperatures
melting additional snow in the foothills. Residents should
prepare for even higher water levels. A pattern change at
midweek will bring this round of significant snow melt to an
end.
- Some locations that will experience minor flooding
include...Two Dot and Martinsdale, and possibly Harlowton.
