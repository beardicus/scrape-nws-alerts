<description>.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 337 AM CDT Mon Apr 10 2023
After a much needed break from fire weather concerns
today, things quickly ramp up Tuesday through Thursday across a
significant chunk of our forecast area. Areas with lingering snow
pack or recent snow melt will be less likely to be affected.
However, any areas that has been snow free for several days will see
near critical to critical fire weather conditions develop towards
the middle of the week. After further collaboration with neighbors,
the Fire Weather Watch that was in place for Tuesday has been
upgraded to a Red Flag Warning starting at noon on Tuesday. This is
mostly due to humidity levels as low as 15 to 25 percent, strong
southwest winds with gusts between 30 to 40 mph, and warmer
temperatures in the mid to upper 80s.
These conditions will likely persists into Wednesday and Thursday at
least across portions of northwestern IA, far southeastern SD, and
far northeast NE. Areas further to the north and northeast continue
to be a bit more uncertain due to higher RH levels and lighter winds
in parts of the area. Another round of precipitation moves into the
area this weekend giving us some brief relief from immediate fire
weather concerns.
People are urged to exercise extreme care with respect to outdoor
activities that could cause grass fires. Avoid equipment that can
cause sparks near dry grass or brush. Do not toss cigarettes on
the ground. Report new fires quickly to the nearest fire
department or law enforcement office.
.... EXTREME FIRE DANGER ....
The Grassland Fire Danger Index will reach the extreme category
Tuesday afternoon. Very poor weather conditions and very low
moisture content of grasses, and other dry organic material on the
ground, indicate that dangerous burning conditions exist. Fires
will spread rapidly and show erratic behavior. Outdoor burning
should be restricted.
OUTLOOK FOR TUESDAY AFTERNOON...The Grassland Fire Danger Index
will reach the extreme category.
The grassland fire danger product reflects fire danger for native
grasses. It is not intended for cured agricultural crops, nor
will it reflect conditions in road ditches which have been mowed.</description>
