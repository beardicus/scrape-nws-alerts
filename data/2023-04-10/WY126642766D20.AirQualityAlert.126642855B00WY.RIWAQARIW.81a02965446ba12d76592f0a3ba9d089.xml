<description>...Ozone Action Day in Effect for Tuesday, April 11, 2023 for the
Upper Green River Basin Ozone Nonattainment Area...
The following message is transmitted at the request of the
Air Quality Division of the Wyoming Department of Environmental
Quality.
The Air Quality Division has issued an Ozone Action Day for Tuesday,
April 11 for the Upper Green River Basin Ozone Nonattainment
Area. An Ozone Action Day is issued when forecasted weather
conditions are favorable for the formation of ozone. Ozone appears
to be elevated in the basin when there is a presence of ozone-
forming precursor emissions including oxides of nitrogen and
volatile organic compounds coupled with meteorological conditions
such as strong temperature inversions, low winds, snow cover, and
sunlight.
Ozone is an air pollutant that can cause respiratory distress
especially to children, the elderly, and people with existing
respiratory conditions such as asthma.  People in these sensitive
groups should limit strenuous or extended outdoor activities,
especially in the afternoon and evening.
For more information on ozone and the health effects of ozone,
please visit the websites for the Wyoming Department of
Environmental Quality at deq.wyoming.gov and the Wyoming
Department of Health at www.health.wyo.gov.
Current information on ozone levels at the Air Quality Division`s
monitoring stations at Daniel South, Pinedale, Boulder, Big
Piney, and Juel Spring can be found at www.wyvisnet.com.</description>
