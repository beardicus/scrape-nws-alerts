<headline>Flood Advisory issued April 10 at 1:06PM CDT until April 14 at 1:00AM CDT by NWS Duluth</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY FOR SNOWMELT IN EFFECT UNTIL 1230 PM CDT
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by snowmelt is expected.
* WHERE...Portions of east central Minnesota, north central
Minnesota and northeast Minnesota, including the following areas,
in east central Minnesota, Aitkin, Crow Wing and Pine counties. In
north central Minnesota, Cass and Itasca. In northeast Minnesota,
Carlton and St. Louis counties.
* WHEN...Until 1230 PM CDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
River or stream flows are elevated.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 102 PM CDT, Spring snowmelt has begun and will continue
with above normal temperatures this week. A near record
amount of water stored in the snowpack will be released.
This will cause rapid snowmelt runoff leading to ponding of
water and quick rises on streams and rivers.  Minor flooding
is expected to begin shortly in the advisory area.
- If you live in an area that has previously experienced spring
flooding impacts, expect to experience those problems again
this year.
- Flood safety information can be found at
www.weather.gov/safety/flood</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and to the National Weather Service in Duluth when you
can do so safely. Flooding can be reported to the National Weather
Service at 1-800-685-8612.</instruction>
