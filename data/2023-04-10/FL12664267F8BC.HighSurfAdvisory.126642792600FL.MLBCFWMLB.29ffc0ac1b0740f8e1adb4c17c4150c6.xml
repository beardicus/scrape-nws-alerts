<headline>High Surf Advisory issued April 10 at 3:43AM EDT until April 11 at 4:00PM EDT by NWS Melbourne</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE TONIGHT...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM EDT
TUESDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM EDT TUESDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, significant coastal
flooding expected. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking
waves of 8 to 10 feet expected in the surf zone. For the High
Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents expected.
* WHERE...Coastal Volusia County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, until 4 AM EDT Tuesday.
For the High Surf Advisory, until 4 PM EDT Tuesday. For the
High Rip Current Risk, through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Coastal roads may be closed. Low lying property
including homes, businesses and some critical infrastructure
will be inundated. Significant shoreline erosion will occur.
Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach
erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The high tide of most concern will occur
around midnight tonight. The Volusia county coast is especially
vulnerable to wave runup given the loss of dunes and sea walls
as a result of Hurricanes Ian and Nicole last autumn.</description>
<instruction>Coastal flooding is occurring or imminent. Coastal residents in
the warned area should be alert for rising water, and take
appropriate action to protect life and property. If travel is
required, do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth.
High surf will affect the beaches in the advisory area, producing
localized beach erosion and dangerous swimming conditions.
Swimmers should remain out of the water due to large breaking
waves and dangerous surf conditions. Entering the surf is not
advised.</instruction>
