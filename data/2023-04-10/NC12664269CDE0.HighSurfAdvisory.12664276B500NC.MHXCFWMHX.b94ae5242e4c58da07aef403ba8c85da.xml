<headline>High Surf Advisory issued April 10 at 3:44PM EDT until April 11 at 12:00AM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EDT
TONIGHT...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 6
to 9 feet in the surf zone, north of Cape Hatteras. For the
Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents and large
breaking waves in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Hatteras Island beaches.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until midnight EDT tonight.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, until 8 PM EDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore
break can throw a swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom
causing neck and back injuries.</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
