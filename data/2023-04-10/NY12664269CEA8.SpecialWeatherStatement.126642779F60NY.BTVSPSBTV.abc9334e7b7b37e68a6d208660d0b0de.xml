<description>...Dry Fuels, Marginally Low Relative Humidity, and Breezy to
Gusty Winds will Increase Fire Weather Concerns Tuesday...
* After a day of dry, breezy conditions, fine fuels are a mix of
near critically dry or at critically dry levels across the St.
Lawrence Valley and locations along US Highway 11 towards Malone
and Ellenburg Depot in northern New York according to the New
York State Department of Environmental Conservation. The
combination of low relative humidity values between 30 to 35
percent and gusty southwest winds of 25 to 40 mph, may lead to
increase fire weather concerns late Tuesday morning into Tuesday
evening. The period of strongest winds and lowest relative
humidity values are expected from noon and 5 PM. If any fires
were to start, the weather and localized fuel conditions may
result in rapid fire spread.
* For more information about the current fire danger rating, any
burn restrictions, and wildfire prevention and education, please
visit your state forestry or environmental protection website.
* Remember, a burn ban is in effect for all of New York through
May 14th, which means no open burning is allowed.</description>
