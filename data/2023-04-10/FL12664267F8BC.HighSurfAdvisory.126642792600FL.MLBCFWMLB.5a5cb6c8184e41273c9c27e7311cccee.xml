<headline>High Surf Advisory issued April 10 at 3:43AM EDT until April 11 at 4:00PM EDT by NWS Melbourne</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE TONIGHT...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM EDT TUESDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM EDT TUESDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding
expected. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 8
to 10 feet expected in the surf zone. For the High Rip Current
Risk, dangerous rip currents expected.
* WHERE...Coastal Indian River, Coastal Saint Lucie and Coastal
Martin Counties.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 4 AM EDT Tuesday.
For the High Surf Advisory, until 4 PM EDT Tuesday. For the
High Rip Current Risk, through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Some flooding of low-lying lots, parks and roadways
may occur near the shoreline. Only isolated road closures are
expected. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The high tide of most concern will occur
around midnight tonight. The Treasure Coast is vulnerable to
wave runup in some areas given the loss of dunes as a result of
Hurricanes Ian and Nicole last autumn.</description>
<instruction>Onshore winds and above normal tides will combine to generate
flooding of low areas along the shore. Do not drive around
barricades or through water of unknown depth. Take the necessary
actions to protect flood-prone property.
High surf will affect the beaches in the advisory area, producing
localized beach erosion and dangerous swimming conditions.
Swimmers should remain out of the water due to large breaking
waves and dangerous surf conditions. Entering the surf is not
advised.</instruction>
