<headline>Flood Warning issued August 05 at 3:58AM AKDT  by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>.Water levels on the Mendenhall are rising at an accelerated rate.
...FLOOD WARNING FOR A GLACIER-DAMMED LAKE OUTBURST REMAINS IN
EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM AKDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by a glacier-dammed lake outburst continues.
* WHERE...The Mendenhall Lake and River around the glacier visitor
center, the Mendenhall campground, Skaters Cabin Road, View Drive
and possibly below Back Loop bridge.
* WHEN...Until 1000 AM AKDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, other low-lying
areas and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 345 AM AKDT, water levels are rising at an accelerated
rate a quarter foot per hour. This rate is exceeding the
current forecast and therefore will reach the moderate flood
stage of 10 feet in the next couple hours rather than late
Saturday afternoon.
- For Mendenhall Lake :
At 3:15am the stage was 9.22 feet.
Minor Flood Stage is 9.0 feet.
Moderate Flood Stage is 10.0 feet.
Forecast: A crest of around 10.7 feet is expected Saturday.
Impacts:
At 9.0 feet: Water covers Skaters Cabin Road between Skaters
Cabin and West Glacier Trailhead, also water will flow into
the Mendenhall Lake Campground.
At 10.0 feet: Water levels will inundate Mendenhall
Campground with up to 3 feet of water covering low areas as
well as up to 1.5 feet of water covering Skaters Cabin Road.
Portions of West Glacier Trail will be impassable.
At 10.4 feet: Significant flooding along the Mendenhall Lake
area with more than 3 feet of water in places and the
Mendenhall campground will be evacuated. Some homes along
View Drive will have up to 3 ft of water in yards.
At 10.9 feet: View Drive will be flooded and impassable with
significant flooding to some homes in the area. Locations
below back loop bridge will begin to see flooding of some
yards, significant bank erosion along with hazardous
navigation from debris in the river.
- Inherent uncertainty in initial glacier lake volume will
result in varying crest height and timing.
- If you live near or along the Mendenhall River, stay alert and
be prepared to take action.
- Mariners should be aware of additional debris in the water.</description>
