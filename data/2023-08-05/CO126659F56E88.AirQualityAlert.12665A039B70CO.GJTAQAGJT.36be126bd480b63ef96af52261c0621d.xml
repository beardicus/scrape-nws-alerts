The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has
issued the following...
WHAT...Air Quality Health Advisory for Wildfire Smoke.
WHERE...central Gunnison County. Locations include, but are not
limited to Gunnison.
WHEN...900 AM Saturday August 05 to 900 AM Sunday August 06
IMPACTS...Air Quality Health Advisory for Wildfire Smoke
Issued for central Gunnison County    Issued at 8:00 AM MDT,
Saturday, August 5, 2023    Issued by the Colorado Department of
Public Health and Environment    Affected Area: central Gunnison
County. Locations include, but are not limited to, Gunnison.
Advisory in Effect: 8:00 AM MDT, Saturday, August 5, 2023 to 9:00
AM MDT, Sunday, August 6, 2023.   Public Health Recommendations:
If smoke is thick or becomes thick in your neighborhood you may
want to remain indoors.  This is especially true for those with
heart disease, respiratory illnesses, the very young, and the
elderly.  Consider limiting outdoor activity when moderate to
heavy smoke is present. Consider relocating temporarily if smoke
is present indoors and is making you ill.  If visibility is less
than 5 miles in smoke in your neighborhood, smoke has reached
levels that are unhealthy.    Outlook: The Lowline wildfire is
located in central Gunnison County approximately 10 miles
southwest of Crested Butte and 14 miles northwest of Gunnison.
Moderate to heavy smoke is possible early Saturday morning from
the fire, southward along County Road 730 to Gunnison. Smoke in
these areas should decrease by late Saturday morning as
atmospheric mixing increases. By Saturday afternoon, smoke will
likely be transported east and northeast of the fire. Most of that
smoke will remain aloft and well above ground level, however brief
periods of moderate to heavy smoke will be possible across eastern
Gunnison County, including Crested Butte. Late Saturday night and
into Sunday morning, smoke could again get heavy as it drains
eastward towards County Road 730 and southward into Gunnison.
