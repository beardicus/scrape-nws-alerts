<headline>Flood Warning issued August 05 at 6:46PM AKDT  by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>.Water levels on the Mendenhall are continuing to rise. Record
flooding is occurring.
...FLOOD WARNING FOR A GLACIER-DAMMED LAKE OUTBURST REMAINS IN
EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM AKDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Record flooding caused by a glacier-dammed lake outburst
continues.
* WHERE...The Mendenhall Lake and River around the glacier visitor
center, the Mendenhall campground, Skaters Cabin Road, View Drive
and below Back Loop bridge.
* WHEN...Until 1000 AM AKDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Record high flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, other
low-lying areas and flood-prone locations near Mendenhall Lake and
River is occurring. Flooding is starting to be reported in areas
that have not previously seen flooding before. Significant bank
erosion is also occurring.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 617 PM AKDT,  Water levels on Mendenhall Lake have reached
13.9 feet which is approaching the Major flood stage of 14.0
feet. This is also now well above the previous record high
stage recorded back in 2016 of 12.0 feet. Water levels
continue to rise with a rate of rise of around 0.3 feet per
hour. Flooding is now being reported in areas that have not
previously seen flooding before and significant bank erosion
has been observed as well.
- For Mendenhall Lake :
At 6:15pm the stage was 13.9 feet.
Major Flood Stage is 14.0 feet.
Forecast: A crest around 14.5 feet is now expected around
8:00pm Saturday. This forecast is highly uncertain as it is
unknown how much water is left to release from Suicide Basin.
This will be a new all time record high stage for the
Mendenhall Lake.
Impacts:
At 10.9 feet: View Drive will be flooded and impassable with
significant flooding to some homes in the area. Locations
below back loop bridge will begin to see flooding of some
yards, significant bank erosion along with hazardous
navigation from debris in the river.
- Inherent uncertainty in initial glacier lake volume will
result in varying crest height and timing.
- If you live near or along the Mendenhall River, stay alert and
be prepared to take action.
- Mariners should be aware of additional debris in the water.</description>
<instruction>Stay tuned to further developments by listening to your local radio,
television, or NOAA Weather Radio for further information.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or creeks.</instruction>
