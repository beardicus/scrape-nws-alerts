<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 515 PM CDT THIS
AFTERNOON FOR SOUTHEASTERN OKALOOSA COUNTY...
At 300 PM CDT, local law enforcement reported thunderstorms
producing heavy rain across the warned area with flooding on US
Highway 98 near Brooks Bridge on Okaloosa Island. Between 3 and 4
inches of rain have fallen. Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2
inches are possible in the warned area. Flash flooding is already
occurring.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Law enforcement reported.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,
highways, streets and underpasses as well as other poor
drainage and low-lying areas.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Wright, Fort Walton Beach, Destin, Mary Esther, Lake Lorraine,
Ocean City, Shalimar, Cinco Bayou and Longwood.
Low lying areas of Destin and Fort Walton Beach have begun to see
flooding of roadways making travel difficult across this area.
Continued storms may lead to even more rainfall over the next hour
or two and flooding could rapidly worsen across the area. This is
especially true along highway 98 near Brooks Bridge.
