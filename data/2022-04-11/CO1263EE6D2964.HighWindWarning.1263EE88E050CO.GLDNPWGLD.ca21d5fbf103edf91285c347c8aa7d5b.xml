<headline>High Wind Warning issued April 11 at 1:37PM MDT until April 12 at 7:00PM MDT by NWS Goodland</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM TO 7 PM MDT TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Strong southwest winds shifting to the northwest during
the late morning or early afternoon. Expect sustained winds
ranging anywhere from 30 to 50 mph and gusts up to 65 mph.
* WHERE...Kit Carson and Cheyenne Counties.
* WHEN...From 11 AM to 7 PM MDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous travel conditions, especially on major
routes such as Interstate 70 and Highway 385. Wind of this
magnitude may also down trees, power lines, and damage property.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Southwest or west southwest winds will
abruptly shift to the northwest during the late morning or early
afternoon.</description>
<instruction>If you must drive on Tuesday, watch for objects blowing across
the roadway and into your path. Keep a safe distance from cars in
adjacent lanes as strong gusts could suddenly push a vehicle
outside its lane of travel. Take extra care in high-profile
vehicles such as a truck, van, or SUV, or when towing a trailer,
as these are more prone to be pushed or even flipped by high
winds.</instruction>
