<headline>Freeze Watch issued April 11 at 1:56AM PDT until April 12 at 9:00AM PDT by NWS Sacramento</headline>
<description>...Possible Freezing Temperatures Return Tuesday Morning to the
Northern Sacramento Valley...
.An unseasonably cold airmass will allow temperatures in the
northern Sacramento Valley to drop to the low 30s late Monday
night into Tuesday morning. These near-freezing and possibly
below-freezing temperatures may impact sensitive plants and
crops, as well as those without adequate heating.
...FREEZE WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Temperatures falling to 30 to 34 degrees for 3 to 7
hours.
* WHERE...Northern Sacramento Valley, including the cities of
Redding and Red Bluff.
* WHEN...From 2 AM PDT Tuesday to 9 AM PDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Frost and freeze conditions could damage crops, other
sensitive vegetation, and unprotected outdoor plumbing.</description>
<instruction>Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
