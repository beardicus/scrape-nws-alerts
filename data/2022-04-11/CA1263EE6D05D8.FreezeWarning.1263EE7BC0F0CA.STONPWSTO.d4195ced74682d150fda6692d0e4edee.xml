<headline>Freeze Warning issued April 11 at 11:46AM PDT until April 12 at 8:00AM PDT by NWS Sacramento</headline>
<description>...Freezing Temperatures Tuesday Morning in Portions of the
Northern and Central Sacramento Valley...
.An unseasonably cold airmass will allow temperatures in the
northern and central Sacramento Valley to drop to the low 30s
Tuesday morning. These near-freezing and possibly below-freezing
temperatures may impact sensitive plants and crops, as well as
those without adequate heating.
...FREEZE WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 2 AM TO 8 AM PDT TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Temperatures falling to 30 to 34 degrees for 3 to 5
hours.
* WHERE...Northern Sacramento Valley, including the cities of
Redding and Red Bluff.
* WHEN...From 2 AM to 8 AM PDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Frost and freeze conditions will kill crops, other
sensitive vegetation and possibly damage unprotected outdoor
plumbing.</description>
<instruction>Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
