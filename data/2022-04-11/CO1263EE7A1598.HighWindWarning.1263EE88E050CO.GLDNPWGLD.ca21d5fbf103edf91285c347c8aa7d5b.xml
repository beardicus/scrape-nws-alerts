<headline>High Wind Warning issued April 11 at 10:06PM MDT until April 12 at 7:00PM MDT by NWS Goodland</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM TO 7 PM MDT
TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Southwest winds turn northwest with speeds of 30 to 40
mph and gusts up to 60 mph expected.
* WHERE...Cheyenne and Kit Carson Counties.
* WHEN...From 11 AM to 7 PM MDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous travel conditions are expected, especially
on major routes such as Interstate 70 and Highway 385. Wind of
this magnitude may down trees, power lines, and damage property
in addition to producing areas of blowing dust that could
result in localized diminished visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Southwest winds will shift to the northwest
between the late morning and early afternoon.</description>
<instruction>If you must drive, watch for objects blowing across the roadway
and into your path. Keep a safe distance from cars in adjacent
lanes as strong gusts could suddenly push a vehicle outside its
lane of travel. Take extra care in high-profile vehicles such as a
truck, van, or SUV, or when towing a trailer, as these are more
prone to be pushed or even flipped by high winds.</instruction>
