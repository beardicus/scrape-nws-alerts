<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued March 22 at 3:58AM AKDT until March 22 at 6:00PM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AKDT THIS
EVENING FOR WESTERN AND SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF KODIAK ISLAND...
* WHAT...Snow and blowing snow expected. Additional snow
accumulations of 2 to 4 inches with locally higher amounts
across interior locations of Kodiak Island. Winds gusting as
high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...Communities along the western and southern portions of
Kodiak Island, including Larsen Bay, Karluk, Akhiok, and Old
Harbor.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM AKDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. Strong winds could
cause tree damage.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A low pressure system will bring strong
winds and snow for western and southern parts of Kodiak Island.
The combination of snow and wind could reduce visibility to as
low as one half mile at times before snow tapers off this evening.
A mix of rain and snow is also expected to change to snow along
northern and eastern portions of the island today as winds
shift from the east to the northwest. However, warmer
temperatures along the eastern half of the island will likely
limit blowing snow potential.</description>
