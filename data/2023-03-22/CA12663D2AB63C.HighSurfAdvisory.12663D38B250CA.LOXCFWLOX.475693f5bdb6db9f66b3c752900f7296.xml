* WHAT...Large breaking waves of 4 to 8 feet with dangerous rip
currents and flooding of sea water over low lying coastal areas.

* IMPACTS...Coastal flooding is possible over low-lying coastal
areas such as beach parking lots and bike paths around the time

Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
