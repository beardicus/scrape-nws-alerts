<description>...A BAND OF HEAVY SNOW WILL AFFECT MUCH OF NATRONA COUNTY...
HAZARDS...A area of heavy snow with visibility to less than a
quarter mile at times is occurring across Natrona County. This band
of heavy snow is producing heavy snow at the rate around 1 to 1 1/2
inches per hour. Roads and highways are slushy to snow packed or
will be in the next hour.
LOCATION AND MOVEMENT...At 643 PM MDT, an area of moderate to heavy
snow was covering much of Natrona County with the heaviest snow
across the west and southwest portions of the county. This area of
snow was moving northeast between 45 and 55 mph. The snow will end
from southwest to northeast, and should end between 9 PM and 10 PM.
LOCATIONS IMPACTED INCLUDE...
All of Natrona County except the far southeast.
This includes Interstate 25 between mile markers 180 and 234.
SAFETY INFO... Use extra caution if you must travel into or through
this band of heavy snow. Rapid changes in visibility and potentially
slick roads may lead to accidents.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time to reach your destination.
