<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY MORNING THROUGH
THURSDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions possible. Total snow accumulations of
1 to 3 inches possible. Winds could gust as high as 40 mph.
Visibilities possibly reduced to one quarter mile or less at
times.
* WHERE...Kuskokwim Delta.
* WHEN...From Thursday morning for Nunivak Island and coastal
locations through Thursday evening for inland locations.
* IMPACTS...Areas of blowing snow could significantly reduce
visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A quick moving compact low pressure system
will impact the area beginning Thursday morning. As the front
moves inland by the afternoon hours, visibility from Nunivak
Island and coastal areas will improve quickly while inland areas
will experience visibility reductions later into the afternoon
and evening hours.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Watch for blizzard conditions means there is a
potential for falling and/or blowing snow with strong winds and
extremely poor visibilities. This can lead to whiteout conditions
and make travel very hazardous.</instruction>
