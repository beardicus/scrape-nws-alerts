waterways due to rain and snowmelt. Minor flooding is ongoing
or expected to begin shortly in the advisory area.

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
In hilly or mountainous terrain, there are many low water crossings
which will become dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross
flooded roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
