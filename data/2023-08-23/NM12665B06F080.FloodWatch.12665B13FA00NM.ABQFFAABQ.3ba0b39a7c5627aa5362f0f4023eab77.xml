* WHEN...From Noon MDT today through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,

especially over the McBride burn scar.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...

the remnants of former tropical storm, Harold, moves near the
U.S. and Mexican border. This will lead to numerous showers
and thunderstorms capable of producing heavy rainfall rates
which may lead to excessive runoff.
