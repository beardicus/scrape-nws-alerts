<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM THURSDAY TO 5 PM PDT
FRIDAY FOR GUSTY WINDS AS WELL AS DRY AND UNSTABLE CONDITIONS FOR
FIRE WEATHER ZONE 659...
The National Weather Service in Seattle has issued a Red Flag
Warning for dry and unstable conditions as well as gusty easterly
winds through the Cascades which is in effect from 11 AM Thursday
to 5 PM PDT Friday. The Fire Weather Watch is no longer in
effect.
* AFFECTED AREA...Fire Weather Zone 659 West Slopes of the
Central Cascades Generally above 1500 Feet.
* WINDS...East 10 to 15 mph.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...As low as 25 percent. Relative humidity
values may be even lower in areas of zone 659 most exposed to
easterly winds.
* THUNDERSTORMS...A chance of thunderstorms is in the forecast for
early Friday morning. Thunderstorms would be moving from south
to north and have the highest likelihood of occurring in the
southern section of zone 659 between 5AM and 11AM Friday
morning.
* OUTFLOW WINDS...Gusty and erratic winds are possible in the
immediate vicinity of any thunderstorms that develop.
* TEMPERATURES...In the upper 70s and 80s.
* HAINES...Mid-level Haines Index 6 or high potential for large
plume dominated fire growth.
* IMPACTS...A dry and unstable air mass with warm temperatures
can contribute to active fire behavior. In western Washington,
significant growth on existing fires takes place under such
conditions. If a fire were to begin, air quality may diminish
in the surrounding area.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either imminent or occurring now. Any fires that develop will
likely spread quickly. Outdoor burning is not recommended.</instruction>
