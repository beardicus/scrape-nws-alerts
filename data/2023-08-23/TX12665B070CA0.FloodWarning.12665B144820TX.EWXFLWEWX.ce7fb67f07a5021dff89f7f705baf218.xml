<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Even 6 inches of fast-moving flood water can knock you off your feet
and a depth of 2 feet will float your car. Never try to walk, swim,
or drive through such swift water. If you come upon flood waters,
stop, turn around and go another way.
To escape rising water, take the shortest path to higher ground.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
The next statement will be issued this evening at 900 PM CDT.</instruction>
