<description>...DENSE FOG CONTINUES ACROSS EASTERN PORTIONS OF BEAUFORT
COUNTY...
Visibilities will slowly improve across eastern portions of
Beaufort County through 1115 AM. Visibilities will drop as low as
1/4 mile at times for locations such as Dale, Beaufort, Hunting
Island, Fripp Island, Parris Island, Ashdale and the far northern
portions of Hilton Head Island. This includes much of the Broad
River. Motorists in these areas should be alert for low
visibilities.</description>
<instruction>If driving, slow down and leave extra distance ahead of you in
case a sudden stop is needed.
Mariners in the Broad River are urged to navigate with extreme
care. If you must navigate in these conditions, proceed with
caution. Use proper fog signals, including fog horns. Make sure
all navigational running lights are on.</instruction>
