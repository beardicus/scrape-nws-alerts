<headline>Flood Watch issued October 25 at 4:27PM AST  by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...FLASH FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY
EVENING...
The Flash Flood Watch continues for
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall. Expect
rainfall accumulations of 3 and 6 inches with locally higher
amounts of up to 10 inches.
* WHERE...All of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.
* WHEN...Through Thursday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Extensive street
flooding and flooding of creeks and rivers are possible. Area
creeks and streams are running high and could flood with more
heavy rain. Mudslides are also possible with any prolonged
period of heavy rain over already saturated soils.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The interaction between an upper-level
trough and a tropical wave could lead to excessive heavy
rainfall through Thursday. This favorable scenario may last
through the rest of the workweek, with the most active activity
on Wednesday. The highest rainfall amounts may fall over the
eastern third of Puerto Rico, Culebra, Vieques, and the U.S.
Virgin Islands.</description>
