<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT...
The following message is transmitted at the request of the New Mexico
Departments of Health and Environment, United States Forest Service
and the Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality Response Program.
* WHAT...Wildfire smoke will be carried toward the east or east-
southeast through the reminder of the afternoon and evening.
Outflow winds associated with isolated to scattered shower and
thunderstorm activity may briefly impact areas along the east
slopes of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains this afternoon or early
evening but the overall impact is not expected to be significant.
Similar to the past couple of nights, surface winds will decouple
after sunset and residual smoke will settle into the valleys and
low-lying areas and drift down-drainage during the overnight into
Thursday morning. In addition to smoke, near record high
temperatures this afternoon and again Thursday are expected for
many of the impacted communities.
New Mexicans may also need to take steps to avoid heat-related
illnesses NM-Tracking - Heat Related Illness.
* WHERE...Locations most likely to experience the greatest impacts
from smoke include the following counties: Catron, Colfax, Mora,
San Miguel, Sierra, and Socorro counties. Impacted communities
include but are not limited to: Arrey, Chacon, Elephant Butte,
Gallinas, Guadalupita, Hatch, Las Vegas, Magdalena, Mora, Ocate,
Pecos, Radium Springs, Sapello, San Antonio, Truth or
Consequences, and Winston.
* WHEN...Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1pm MDT
Thursday, May 19th.
* IMPACTS...Those with conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and heart
disease will be especially vulnerable to impacts from poor air
quality, as will adults over age 65, young children, and pregnant
women if smoke concentrations become unhealthy.
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to determine
if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method available at
https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/IndoorQuality.html and
https://cv.nmhealth.org
New Mexicans will also need to take steps to keep their homes cool to
avoid heat-related illnesses. NMDOH offers tips here:
