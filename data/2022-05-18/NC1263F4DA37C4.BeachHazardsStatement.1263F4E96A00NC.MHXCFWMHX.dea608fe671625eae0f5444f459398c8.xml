<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued May 18 at 8:41PM EDT until May 19 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 AM EDT
THURSDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM EDT THURSDAY
THROUGH THURSDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, 1 to 2 feet of inundation
above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways. For the Beach Hazards Statement, strong longshore
currents in the surf zone.
* WHERE...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, areas in North Topsail
Beach, the lower New River, and adjacent tidal creeks. For the
Beach Hazards Statement, coastal Onslow County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 2 AM EDT
Thursday. For the Beach Hazards Statement, from 8 AM EDT
Thursday through Thursday evening.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Strong longshore currents
will create dangerous swimming conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...In addition to strong longshore currents, a
moderate rip current risk is expected for a couple of hours
either side of low tide, which is forecast to occur around 4:30
PM.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
