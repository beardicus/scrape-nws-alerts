<description>...AIR QUALITY HEALTH ADVISORY FOR WILDFIRE SMOKE FROM 900 AM
WEDNESDAY UNTIL 900 AM THURSDAY...
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has
issued the following...
WHAT...Air Quality Health Advisory for Wildfire Smoke.
WHERE...southern Mineral and northern Archuleta Counties.
Locations include, but not limited to, Pagosa Springs.
WHEN...900 AM Wednesday May 18 to 900 AM Thursday May 19
IMPACTS...Moderate to heavy smoke can be expected Wednesday
morning for areas in close vicinity to the Plumtaw wildfire,
including Pagosa Springs. Air quality will improve by late
Wednesday morning as atmospheric mixing increases and smoke lifts
into the atmosphere, however brief periods of moderate to heavy
smoke will be possible downwind to the east of the fire along the
Archuleta and Mineral County line. By late Wednesday evening,
smoke will begin to drain to locations south and southwest of the
fire, including Pagosa Springs, bringing occasional heavy smoke
through early Thursday morning.
HEALTH INFORMATION...Public Health Recommendations: If smoke is
thick or becomes thick in your neighborhood you may want to remain
indoors. This is especially true for those with heart disease,
respiratory illnesses, the very young, and the elderly. Consider
limiting outdoor activity when moderate to heavy smoke is present.
Consider relocating temporarily if smoke is present indoors and is
making you ill. If visibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in
your neighborhood, smoke has reached levels that are unhealthy.</description>
