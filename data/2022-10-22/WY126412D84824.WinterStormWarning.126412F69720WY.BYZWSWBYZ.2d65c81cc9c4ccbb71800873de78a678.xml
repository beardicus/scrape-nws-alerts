<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued October 22 at 1:37PM MDT until October 24 at 12:00PM MDT by NWS Billings</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM NOON SUNDAY TO NOON MDT
MONDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow and periods of blowing snow. Total snow
accumulations between 3 and 8 inches, with locally heavier amounts
in the higher hills and foothills. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...In Montana, Southern Big Horn and Southern Rosebud. In
Wyoming, Sheridan Foothills.
* WHEN...From Noon Sunday to Noon MDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will
likely become slick and hazardous. The strong winds and weight of
snow on tree limbs and power lines, may result in sporadic power
outages and downed trees. Whiteout conditions are likely at times,
and will combine with the heavy wet snow to make travel
treacherous. The hazardous conditions could impact the Monday
morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Travel on portions of I-90 from Crow Agency
south through Sheridan county and on US-212 from Crow Agency
through southern Rosebud county will be impacted.</description>
<instruction>Persons should consider delaying all travel. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution. Consider taking a winter
storm kit along with you, including such items as tire chains,
booster cables, flashlight, shovel, blankets and extra clothing.
Also take water, a first aid kit, and anything else that would help
you survive in case you become stranded.</instruction>
