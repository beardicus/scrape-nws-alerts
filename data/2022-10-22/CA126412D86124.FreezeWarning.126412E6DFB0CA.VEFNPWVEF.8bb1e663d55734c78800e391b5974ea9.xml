* WHAT...For the High Wind Warning, west winds 25 to 35 mph with

the Freeze Warning, from 11 PM this evening to 8 AM PDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Damaging winds will blow down trees and power lines.
Travel will be difficult, especially for high-profile
vehicles. Areas of blowing dust are likely. Frost and freeze
conditions will kill crops, other sensitive vegetation and
possibly damage unprotected outdoor plumbing.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Strongest winds are expected along and
west of Highway 395, especially south of Lone Pine.</description>
<instruction>Take action to secure trash cans, lawn furniture, and other
lightweight fixtures and unsecured outdoor objects. Operators of
motorcycles, vans, campers, trailers, and other high profile
vehicles should be especially cautious for the possibility of
sudden, strong crosswinds and be prepared for areas of blowing
dust which could drastically reduce visibility.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
