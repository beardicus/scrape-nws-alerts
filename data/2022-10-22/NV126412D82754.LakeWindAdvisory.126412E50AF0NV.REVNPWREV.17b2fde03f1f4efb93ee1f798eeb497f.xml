<description>...LAKE WIND ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM PDT THIS
EVENING FOR PYRAMID LAKE...
...FREEZE WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 11 PM THIS EVENING TO
8 AM PDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...For the Freeze Warning, sub-freezing temperatures as
low as 27 expected. For the Lake Wind Advisory, northwest
winds 15 to 20 mph with gusts up to 35 mph. Waves 2 to 4 feet.
* WHERE...Western Nevada Basin and Range including Pyramid Lake.
* WHEN...For the Freeze Warning, from 11 PM this evening to 8 AM
PDT Sunday. For the Lake Wind Advisory, until 8 PM PDT this

* IMPACTS...Small boats, kayaks and paddle boards will be prone
to capsizing and should remain off lake waters until
conditions improve. Frost and freeze conditions will kill
crops, other sensitive vegetation and possibly damage
unprotected outdoor plumbing.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Even colder temperatures are expected
Sunday night into Monday morning with a hard freeze all areas.
Now is a good time to winterize irrigation systems and prepare
for routine freezing temperatures.</description>
<instruction>Check lake conditions before heading out and be prepared for a
sudden increase in winds and wave heights. Consider postponing
boating activities on the lake until a day with less wind.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
