WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY ACROSS NORTHEAST WYOMING...THE
BLACK HILLS...AND SOUTHWEST SOUTH DAKOTA...

front lifts slowly north across northeast Wyoming, the Black
Hills, and southern South Dakota. Southwesterly winds will become
quite gusty near and to the south of the boundary in the
afternoon, with humidity values dropping into the teens. Combined
with dry fuels, this will produce critical fire weather
conditions.

contribute to extreme fire behavior.</instruction>
