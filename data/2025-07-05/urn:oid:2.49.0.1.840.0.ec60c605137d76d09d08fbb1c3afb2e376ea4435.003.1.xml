* WIND
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Equivalent Tropical Storm force wind
- Peak Wind Forecast: 30-40 mph with gusts to 45 mph
- Window for Tropical Storm force winds: early Sunday morning
until Sunday afternoon

- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for wind 39
to 57 mph
- The wind threat has remained nearly steady from the
previous assessment.
- PLAN: Plan for hazardous wind of equivalent tropical storm
force.
- PREPARE: Remaining efforts to protect property should be
completed as soon as possible. Prepare for limited wind
damage.
- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.

- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes is possible. Unsecured lightweight objects may
be blown about.
- Some large limbs may break from trees. A few shallow rooted
or weak trees may snap or be knocked down. Some fences and
roadway signs will be damaged.
- A few roads may become impassable due to debris,
particularly within urban or heavily wooded places.
Hazardous driving conditions are possible, especially for
high profile vehicles on bridges and other elevated
roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages are possible.

* STORM SURGE
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Localized storm surge possible
- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 1-3 feet
above ground somewhere within surge prone areas
- Window of concern: through this evening

- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm
surge flooding greater than 1 foot above ground
- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the
previous assessment.
- PLAN: Shelter against storm surge flooding greater than 1
foot above ground.
- PREPARE: All flood preparations should be complete. Expect
flooding of low-lying roads and property.
- ACT: Stay away from storm surge prone areas. Continue to
follow the instructions of local officials.

- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Unfolding
- Potential impacts from the main surge event are unfolding.

* FLOODING RAIN
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:
- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 2-4 inches, with locally
higher amounts

- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for
moderate flooding rain
- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from
the previous assessment.
- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for
moderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues

- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area
vulnerable to flooding.
- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take
action may result in serious injury or loss of life.

- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant
- Moderate flooding from rainfall may prompt some evacuations
and rescues.
- Rivers and streams may rise and overspill their banks in a
few places, especially in the typical prone locations.
Small creeks and ditches may overflow.
- Flood waters may enter some structures. Underpasses,
low-lying spots along roadways, and poor drainage areas may
become submerged by rising water. Some secondary streets
and parking lots may flood as storm drains and retention
ponds overflow.
- Driving conditions will become hazardous, and some road
closures can be expected.

tornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before
hazardous weather arrives.

quickly.

- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder
preparedness actions during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with
power and communications disruptions.
- Tornadoes can cause damage to trees, vehicles, boats, and
buildings. Unsecured mobile homes and poorly constructed
structures are particularly vulnerable.
