        <headline>Tropical Storm Watch issued July 5 at 11:01PM EDT by NWS Charleston SC</headline>
        <description>* LOCATIONS AFFECTED
- Charleston
- McClellanville
- Edisto Island

* WIND
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Below tropical storm force wind
- Peak Wind Forecast: 10-15 mph with gusts to 25 mph

- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for wind 39
to 57 mph
- The wind threat has remained nearly steady from the
previous assessment.
- PLAN: Plan for hazardous wind of equivalent tropical storm
force.
- PREPARE: Remaining efforts to protect property should be
completed as soon as possible. Prepare for limited wind
damage.
- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.

- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees
are shallow rooted.
- Some roads impassable due to debris, particularly within
urban or heavily wooded locations. Hazardous driving
conditions on bridges and other elevated roadways,
especially for high profile vehicles.
- Isolated to scattered power and communications outages.

* STORM SURGE
- No storm surge inundation forecast

- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Little to no storm
surge flooding
- The storm surge threat has decreased from the previous
assessment.
- PLAN: The threat from storm surge is diminishing as flood
waters recede.
- PREPARE: Heed instructions from local officials when moving
about. Do not enter flooded areas.
- ACT: Exercise safety.

- REALIZED IMPACTS: Being Assessed
- Little to no additional surge impacts expected. Community
officials are now assessing the extent of actual surge
impacts accordingly.

* FLOODING RAIN
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:
- Peak Rainfall Amounts: No additional significant rainfall
forecast

- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for
localized flooding rain
- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from
the previous assessment.
- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for
localized flooding from heavy rain.
- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area
vulnerable to flooding.
- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings.

- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited
- Localized rainfall flooding could prompt a few rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries could quickly rise with swifter
currents. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches could
become swollen and overflow in spots.
- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in
normally vulnerable spots. Rapid ponding of water could
occur at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become
near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge
closures.

* TORNADO
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:
- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes

- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for a few
tornadoes
- The tornado threat has remained nearly steady from the
previous assessment.
- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a
few tornadoes.
- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to
tornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before
hazardous weather arrives.
- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter
quickly.

- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited
- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency
plans.
- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along
with power and communications disruptions.
- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees,
vehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and
other poorly constructed structures.
