This product covers southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia

**CHANTAL TO APPROACH THE SOUTH CAROLINA COAST SUNDAY MORNING**

NEW INFORMATION
---------------

* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None

* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Charleston

* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 140 miles south-southeast of Charleston SC
- 30.9N 79.0W
- Storm Intensity 40 mph
- Movement North or 005 degrees at 2 mph

SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------

Tropical Storm Chantal will meander towards the South Carolina
coast today and tonight before making landfall along the middle and
upper South Carolina coast Sunday morning.

As Chantal nears the coast, breezy northwest winds will occur as the
system interacts with high pressure to the north. Wind gusts are
forecast to remain the strongest along the South Carolina beaches,
with gusts around 40 mph possible. In addition, wind gusts across the
elevated bridges around the Charleston Metro area may exceed 45 mph at
times today.

Rain bands will push onshore along the coast of the South Carolina
Lowcountry this morning and continue into tonight. These bands may
drift slowly inland as the system nears the coast bringing as much as
1 to 2 inches of rain. The rain may become locally heavy at times,
resulting in flooding, mainly in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
Heavy rainfall could occur during the late afternoon high tide,
potentially increasing the risk of flooding across coastal communities
and locations near tidal waterways late this afternoon into early this
evening. This includes Downtown Charleston. Widespread flash flooding
is unlikely at this time.

Gusty winds and building waves will result in strong rip currents
along the South Carolina and Georgia coast through this weekend. In
addition, beach erosion and high surf with breakers of 4 to 6 feet
could occur along the beaches of Charleston County.

POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------

* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
Charleston County. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or uprooted,
but with greater numbers in places where trees are shallow
rooted.
- Some roads impassable due to debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded locations. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways, especially for high
profile vehicles.
- Isolated to scattered power and communications outages.

Elsewhere across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia,
little to no impact is anticipated.

* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across the South Carolina Lowcountry. Potential
impacts include:
- Localized rainfall flooding could prompt a few rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries could quickly rise with swifter
currents. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches could
become swollen and overflow in spots.
- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in normally
vulnerable spots. Rapid ponding of water could occur at
underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage areas. Several
storm drains and retention ponds become near-full and begin to
overflow. Some brief road and bridge closures.

Elsewhere across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia,
little to no impact is anticipated.

* OTHER COASTAL HAZARDS:
Gusty winds and increasing wave activity will result in strong rip
currents and high surf along the South Carolina and Georgia coasts
through this weekend.

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------

* EVACUATIONS:
Follow the advice of local officials.

* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Always heed the advice of local officials and comply with orders that
are issued. Do not needlessly jeopardize your life or the lives of
others.

Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes
to the forecast.

warrant.
