<headline>Flood Watch issued December 28 at 2:00PM PST until December 29 at 6:00AM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>.A series of systems will bring more rain to Northern and Central
California starting late tonight and continue through New Years Eve
day.  While the rain will be light to moderate at times through
Friday, this rain will continue to saturate the soils, and prime the
pump for potential flooding.  A strong Pacific storm will then move
across the the region Friday night through Saturday evening, with
periods of moderate to heavy rain expected.  Therefore, increased
runoff will result in rapid rises and flooding of area rivers,
streams, and creeks.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH SATURDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of northern California, including the following
areas, Coastal North Bay Including Point Reyes National Seashore,
Marin Coastal Range, North Bay Interior Mountains, North Bay
Interior Valleys and Sonoma Coastal Range.
* WHEN...From Friday afternoon through Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water crossings may be
flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A number of forecast points on North Bay rivers and streams
are already forecast to rise above monitor stage and
potentially above flood stage.
- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
