<headline>Flood Watch issued December 28 at 9:29AM PST until December 31 at 4:00PM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>.Another warm atmospheric river is expected to push into the Sierra
and western Nevada beginning on Friday. High snow levels and
prolonged heavy rainfall will allow for significant rises on both
mainstem and smaller rivers/streams. This may result in minor to
moderate flooding on some area rivers and streams. Rock falls will
be possible, especially in steep terrain and where soils are already
saturated. Some urban flooding is likely, particularly in low-lying
areas or poor drainage.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY MORNING THROUGH SATURDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...River and urban flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of California and Nevada, including the following
areas, in California, Greater Lake Tahoe Area, Lassen-Eastern
Plumas-Eastern Sierra Counties, Mono County and Surprise Valley
California. In Nevada, Greater Lake Tahoe Area, Greater
Reno-Carson City-Minden Area and Northern Washoe County.
* WHEN...From Friday morning through Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of mainstem
rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone
locations. Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks.
Flooding is possible in urban areas and locations with poor
drainage. Low water crossings may be flooded.
Mainstem river flooding is most likely to occur on the East Fork of
the Carson near Gardnerville and the Susan River at Susanville.
Other streams draining significant terrain under approximately 6,500
feet will also be prone to flooding. Out-of-bank flows could result
in road closures, causing travel impacts.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- High snow levels along with prolonged heavy rainfall on
recently saturated ground and snow pack. Storm total liquid
accumulations of 4 to 7 inches along the Sierra crest, 3 to 5
inches in the Tahoe Basin, and 1.5 to 3.5 inches elsewhere in
the Flood Watch, including the Reno/Carson/Minden area.
- Visit CNRFC.noaa.gov and http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
