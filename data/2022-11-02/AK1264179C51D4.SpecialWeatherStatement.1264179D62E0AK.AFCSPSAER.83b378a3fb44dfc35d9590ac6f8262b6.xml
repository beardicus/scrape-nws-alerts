<description>...LIGHT SNOW AND AREAS OF BLOWING AND DRIFTING SNOW TO PERSIST
THROUGH WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...
A band of snow persists this morning from Ninilchik north along
the Sterling Highway to Kenai and Soldotna. The heaviest and most
persistent snowfall has been around Kenai, where 3 to 6 inches of
snow has fallen as of 6am AKDT. The snow is expected to diminish
in intensity over the next couple of hours before redeveloping
later this morning and lifting north across the region through
early afternoon. An additional 1 to 3 inches of snow is possible
before the snow tapers off this afternoon. Gusty winds with this
storm system will also produce areas of blowing and drifting snow
along the Sterling Highway.
Please use caution when traveling. Blowing snow and resuspended
snow from vehicles may reduce visibility along area roadways at
times.</description>
