<description>...AREAS OF MODERATE TO HEAVY SNOW ALONG THE STERLING HIGHWAY
FROM NINILCHIK TO NIKISKI THROUGH WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...
Areas of moderate to heavy snow continue to fall this morning
from Ninilchik north along the Sterling Highway to Kenai,
Soldotna, and Nikiski. The heaviest and most persistent snowfall
has been from Kenai to Ninilchik, where 6 to 20 inches of snow
have fallen as of 9 am AKDT. As of 11 am AKDT, the back edge of
this band of moderate to heavy snow is over Ninilchik and is
continuing to lift north. Expect moderate to heavy snow to
continue from Ninilchik north through the next couple of hours
before the snow finally tapers off. Expect an additional 1 to 4
inches of snow before the event winds down.
Please use caution when traveling. Blowing snow and resuspended
snow from vehicles may reduce visibility along area roadways at
times.</description>
