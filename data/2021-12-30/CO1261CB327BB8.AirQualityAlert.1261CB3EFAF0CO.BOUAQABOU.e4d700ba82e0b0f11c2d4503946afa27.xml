THURSDAY UNTIL 800 PM THURSDAY...
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has
issued the following...
WHAT...Air Quality Health Advisory for Wildfire Smoke.
WHERE...Broomfield and southeastern Boulder Counties. Locations
include, but are not limited to Louisville, Superior, Lafayette,
and Broomfield.
WHEN...200 PM Thursday December 30 to 800 PM Thursday December 30
IMPACTS...Smoke from grass fires and possibly burning structures
will impact southeastern Boulder County and areas downwind into
Broomfield County Thursday afternoon. The wind will decrease
during the late afternoon and early evening hours which should
decrease fire activity and smoke production.
HEALTH INFORMATION...Public Health Recommendations: If smoke is
thick or becomes thick in your neighborhood you may want to remain
indoors. This is especially true for those with heart disease,
respiratory illnesses, the very young, and the elderly. Consider
limiting outdoor activity when moderate to heavy smoke is present.
Consider relocating temporarily if smoke is present indoors and is
making you ill. If visibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in
your neighborhood, smoke has reached levels that are unhealthy.</description>
