<description>...COLD START TO 2022, NEXT WINTER SYSTEM EARLY NEXT WEEK...
* Coldest air in nearly 5 years is set to arrive for the end of
the week into the New Year`s weekend with frigid temperatures
most likely Saturday and Sunday mornings. Forecast lows are in
the single digits to mid teens for much of western Nevada and
below zero in colder Sierra communities.
* Vulnerable and homeless populations could be significantly
impacted. People traveling to the Sierra ski areas should
prepare for very cold wind chills. New Year`s Eve at this point
looks dry but quite chilly for outdoor activities with wind
chills ranging from near zero to 15 degrees above zero by
midnight.
* Our next system arrives early next week bringing gusty winds,
mountain snow, and valley rain and snow. This storm will be
nothing like the series of storms we just had in terms of
snowfall; however, travel difficulties are still likely late
Monday through Tuesday in the Sierra and for the passes of
northeast California with winds causing blowing snow and areas
of low visibility.
* Winds will be rather strong late Monday through late Tuesday
with the potential for gusts to exceed 60 mph for wind prone
valley locations, especially along the US-395/I-580 corridor
between Susanville and Bridgeport. Ridge gusts are likely to
exceed 100 mph with potential for downed trees and power
outages.</description>
