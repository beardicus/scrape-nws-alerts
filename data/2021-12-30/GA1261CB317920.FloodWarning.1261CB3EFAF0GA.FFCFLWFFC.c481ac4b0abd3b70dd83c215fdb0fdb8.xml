<description>...The National Weather Service in Peachtree City GA has issued a
Flood Warning for the following rivers in Georgia...
Snapfinger Creek near Glen Haven affecting DeKalb County.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM THIS MORNING UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is occurring.

* WHEN...From this morning until further notice.
* IMPACTS...At 12 feet, Flood stage is reached. Minor flooding will
occur in portions of the woodlands and yards near the creek

primarily affect locations off South Indian Creek Drive and
Rowland Road upstream from the gage. A park near the creek off of
Rowland Road will begin to flood. The drain pipes under the bridge
at Redan Road will no longer function properly...which will cause
drainage water to backup on low portions of the road.

- Forecast...No forecast is available for this location.
- Flood stage is 12 feet.
