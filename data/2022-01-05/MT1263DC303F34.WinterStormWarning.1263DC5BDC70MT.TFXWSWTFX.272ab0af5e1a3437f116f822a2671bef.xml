* WHAT...For the Winter Storm Warning, heavy snow expected. Total

10 to 20 inches in the mountains. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph

* WHERE...The Rocky Mountain Front.
* WHEN...For the Winter Storm Warning, from 6 AM Thursday to
Midnight MST Friday Night. For the Wind Chill Advisory, until 3 PM

* IMPACTS...Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will
likely become slick and hazardous. Whiteout conditions are

life-threatening. Travel could be very difficult to impossible.
The hazardous conditions could impact the Wednesday evening and
Thursday morning commutes. The dangerously cold wind chills could
cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.</description>
<instruction>Persons should consider delaying all travel. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution. Consider taking a winter
storm kit along with you, including such items as tire chains,
booster cables, flashlight, shovel, blankets and extra clothing.
Also take water, a first aid kit, and anything else that would help
you survive in case you become stranded.
Use caution while traveling outside. Wear appropriate clothing, a
hat, and gloves.</instruction>
