<instruction>A Coastal Flood Advisory means that tidal overflow flooding is
expected. Coastal residents in the warned area should be alert
for rising water, and take appropriate action to protect life and
property.
A Coastal Flood Advisory for Minor Tidal Overflow indicates that
coastal and inland flooding of low lying areas is expected due to
elevated river levels combined with high astronomical tides.
Property damage can occur, but is usually localized. Low-lying
roads may be closed due to high water.</instruction>
