<description>...Blowing and Drifting Snow Continues...
.While most of the accumulating snow has or will end across the
area, wind gusts remain strong at times causing some blowing and
drifting snow. This is especially true in open areas or ridge
locations where snow may be blown aloft causing temporary
reduction in visibilities. Drifts may cross roads at times too.
Be careful near other vehicles or trucks that might stir up fresh
snow causing temporary white out conditions as well.
There will be travel impacts, including the afternoon commute.
Plan now and check road conditions and the latest forecast before
heading out.
In addition, very cold wind chills will start to filter into the
area.
