<description>...Blowing and Drifting Snow Continues...
.While most of the accumulating snow has or will end across the
area, wind gusts remain strong at times causing some blowing and
drifting snow. This is especially true in open areas or ridge
locations where snow may be blown aloft causing temporary
reduction in visibilities. Drifts may cross roads at times too.
Be careful near other vehicles or trucks that might stir up fresh
snow causing temporary white out conditions as well.
There will be travel impacts, including the afternoon commute.
Plan now and check road conditions and the latest forecast before
heading out.
In addition, very cold wind chills will start to filter into the
area.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM CST THIS
EVENING...
...WIND CHILL ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM THIS EVENING
TO 3 PM CST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...For the Winter Weather Advisory, blowing snow. Winds
gusting as high as 40 mph. For the Wind Chill Advisory, very
cold wind chills expected. Wind chills as low as 30 below zero
tonight.
* WHERE...Portions of north central and northeast Iowa and
southeast Minnesota.
* WHEN...For the Winter Weather Advisory, until 6 PM CST this
evening. For the Wind Chill Advisory, from 9 PM this evening
to 3 PM CST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Blowing snow could

exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes tonight and Thursday
morning.</description>
