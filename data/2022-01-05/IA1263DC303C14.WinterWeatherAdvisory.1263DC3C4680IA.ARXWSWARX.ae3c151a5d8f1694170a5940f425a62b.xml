<description>...Blowing and Drifting Snow Continues...
.While most of the accumulating snow has or will end across the
area, wind gusts remain strong at times causing some blowing and
drifting snow. This is especially true in open areas or ridge
locations where snow may be blown aloft causing temporary
reduction in visibilities. Drifts may cross roads at times too.
Be careful near other vehicles or trucks that might stir up fresh
snow causing temporary white out conditions as well.
There will be travel impacts, including the afternoon commute.
Plan now and check road conditions and the latest forecast before
heading out.
In addition, very cold wind chills will start to filter into the
area.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM CST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Blowing and drifting snow. Very little additional snow.
Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of southwest and west central Wisconsin,
northeast Iowa and southeast Minnesota.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM CST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Patchy blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the evening commute. Gusty winds could
bring down tree branches.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
For the latest road conditions, check 511ia.org in Iowa,
511mn.org in Minnesota, and 511wi.gov in Wisconsin.</instruction>
