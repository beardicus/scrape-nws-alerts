<headline>Wind Chill Advisory issued January 05 at 3:34AM CST until January 06 at 3:00PM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Significant Wind, Blowing Snow, and Whiteout Impacts Expected
Tonight into Wednesday...
.A winter storm will bring accumulating snow and strong winds to
the region through Wednesday. Winds will gust to 30 to 50 mph
with the strongest wind gusts 40 to 50 mph west of I94. Combined
with falling snow, these strong winds will lead to significant
reductions in visibility with periodic whiteout conditions,
especially in rural, open areas. Wind-prone areas of southeast
Minnesota will be especially susceptible to prolonged poor
visibility and strong winds where a Blizzard Warning is in effect.
Accumulating snow will be highest north of I-94 where 3 to 6
inches is expected. The winds north of I-94 will gust 30 to 40
mph...increasing through the morning and continuing into the
afternoon. Generally 1 to 3&quot; expected between I-90 and I-94 with
an inch or less south of I-90.
There will be travel impacts, including the morning commute. Plan
now and check road conditions and the latest forecast before
heading out. Be prepared to adjust travel if conditions warrant
it. Isolated power outages will be possible.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM CST THIS
EVENING...
...WIND CHILL ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM THIS EVENING TO 3 PM
CST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...For the Winter Weather Advisory, snow. Additional snow
accumulations of an inch with total snow accumulations less than
an inch in northeast Iowa and an inch or two along the I90
corridor. Winds gusting as high as 50 mph. For the Wind Chill
Advisory, very cold wind chills expected. Wind chills as low as
30 below zero.
* WHERE...Portions of north central and northeast Iowa and
southeast Minnesota.

minutes.</description>
