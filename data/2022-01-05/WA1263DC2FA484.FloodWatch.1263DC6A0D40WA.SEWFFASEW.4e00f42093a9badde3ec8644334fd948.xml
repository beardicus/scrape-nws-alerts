<headline>Flood Watch issued January 05 at 9:21AM PST  by NWS Seattle</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and lowland snowmelt is possible,
with an increased threat of landslides.
* WHERE...A portion of west central Washington, including the
following county, Snohomish.
* WHEN...From late tonight through Saturday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Melting lowland snow will contribute to the flood potential and to
soil saturation and thus, increasing the threat of landslides.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A period of precipitation from Wednesday evening through
Friday will result in accumulations of water equivalent of 4
to 9 inches for the Cascades, and 1 to 3 inches in the
lowlands, with locally higher amounts. The snow level will
rise over western Washington resulting in a good portion of
the precipitation falling as rain. Lowland snow over much of
the area will also melt, contributing to saturated soil and
storm runoff. The uncertainty with the rising snow level and
the amount of lowland snowmelt makes the flood potential
quite uncertain as to how much flooding there will be.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
