10 to 20 inches in the mountains. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph

* WHEN...For the Winter Storm Warning, from 6 AM Thursday to

* IMPACTS...Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will

The hazardous conditions could impact the Wednesday evening and
Thursday morning commutes. The dangerously cold wind chills could
cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.</description>
<instruction>Persons should consider delaying all travel. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution. Consider taking a winter
storm kit along with you, including such items as tire chains,
booster cables, flashlight, shovel, blankets and extra clothing.
Also take water, a first aid kit, and anything else that would help
you survive in case you become stranded.
Use caution while traveling outside. Wear appropriate clothing, a
hat, and gloves.</instruction>
