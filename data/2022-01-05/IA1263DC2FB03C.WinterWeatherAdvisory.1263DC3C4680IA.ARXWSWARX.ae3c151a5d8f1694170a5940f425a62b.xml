<description>...Significant Wind, Blowing Snow, and Some Whiteouts Expected
This Afternoon...
.A winter storm will bring accumulating snow and strong winds to
the region this afternoon. Winds will gust to 30 to 40 mph with
the strongest wind gusts west of the Mississippi River. Combined
with falling snow, these strong winds will lead to reductions in

open areas. Additional snow this afternoon will be up to 1 inch
along and north of Interstate 90. Accumulating snow will be
highest north of I-94 where a total of 3 to 6 inches is expected.
Generally 1 to 3 inches expected between I-90 and I-94 with an
inch or less south of I-90.
There will be travel impacts, including the afternoon commute.
Plan now and check road conditions and the latest forecast before
heading out. Be prepared to adjust travel if conditions warrant
it.
