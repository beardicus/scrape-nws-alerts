<headline>Blizzard Warning issued January 05 at 3:34AM CST until January 05 at 12:00PM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Significant Wind, Blowing Snow, and Whiteout Impacts Expected
Tonight into Wednesday...
.A winter storm will bring accumulating snow and strong winds to
the region through Wednesday. Winds will gust to 30 to 50 mph
with the strongest wind gusts 40 to 50 mph west of I94. Combined
with falling snow, these strong winds will lead to significant
reductions in visibility with periodic whiteout conditions,
especially in rural, open areas. Wind-prone areas of southeast
Minnesota will be especially susceptible to prolonged poor
visibility and strong winds where a Blizzard Warning is in effect.
Accumulating snow will be highest north of I-94 where 3 to 6
inches is expected. The winds north of I-94 will gust 30 to 40
mph...increasing through the morning and continuing into the
afternoon. Generally 1 to 3&quot; expected between I-90 and I-94 with
an inch or less south of I-90.
There will be travel impacts, including the morning commute. Plan
now and check road conditions and the latest forecast before
heading out. Be prepared to adjust travel if conditions warrant
it. Isolated power outages will be possible.

...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO
6 PM CST THIS EVENING...

* WHAT...For the Blizzard Warning, blizzard conditions. Additional
snow accumulations of up to one inch and total snow
accumulations of an inch or two. Winds gusting as high as 50

* WHERE...Dodge, Olmsted, Mower and Fillmore Counties.

Wind Chill Advisory, from 9 PM this evening to 3 PM CST
Thursday. For the Winter Weather Advisory, from noon today to
