<headline>Snow Squall Warning issued December 02 at 12:56AM MST until December 02 at 1:30AM MST by NWS Saltlake</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Salt Lake City has issued a
* Snow Squall Warning for...
Eastern Tooele County in northern Utah...
* Until 130 AM MST
* At 1254 AM MST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from near Great Salt Lake South of the Causeway to 14
miles east of Utah Test and Training Range South, moving southeast
at 35 mph.
HAZARD...Flash freeze on roads. Intense bursts of heavy snow and
gusty winds leading to blowing snow and rapidly falling
visibility. Wind gusts greater than 50 mph could blow
around unsecured objects.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Travel will become difficult and potentially dangerous
within minutes.
This includes Interstate 80 in Utah between mile markers 67 and 101.
Locations impacted include...
Tooele, Grantsville, Stansbury Park, Delle, Tooele Army Depot, Skull
Valley, Great Salt Lake South of the Causeway, Dugway Proving Ground
Test Range, Lake Point and Erda.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads,
bridges, and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and
be prepared for a sudden loss of traction.
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.</description>
