<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1000 AM MST FOR
SOUTHERN GOSHEN...CENTRAL LARAMIE AND SOUTHEASTERN PLATTE COUNTIES...
At 923 AM MST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from 10 miles west of Veteran to 7 miles east of Virginia
Dale, moving east at 50 mph.
HAZARD...Flash freeze on roads. Intense bursts of heavy snow and
gusty winds leading to blowing snow and visibility rapidly
falling to less than one-quarter mile. Wind gusts greater
than 50 mph could knock down tree limbs and blow around
unsecured objects.
SOURCE...Radar and webcams.
IMPACT...Travel will become difficult and potentially dangerous
within minutes.
This snow squall will be near...
Veteran around 935 AM MST.
Yoder around 940 AM MST.
Huntley around 950 AM MST.
Other locations impacted by this snow squall include Fox Farm-College
and South Greeley High.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads,
bridges, and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and
be prepared for a sudden loss of traction.
Slow Down! Rapid changes in visibility and road conditions are
expected with this dangerous snow squall. Be alert for sudden
whiteout conditions.
Reduce speed and turn on headlights! During snow squalls, the
visibility may suddenly drop to near zero in whiteout conditions.</description>
