<description>...MISSOURI RIVER NEAR BISMARCK AND MANDAN ICING OVER...
While ice has been making its way through the Bismarck and Mandan
reach of the Missouri the past few days, data for the Missouri River
gages at Bismarck, Below Mandan, and Schmidt Bottoms all reflect a
steady rise over the past 24 hours of nearly one foot. This is
somewhat slower than normal even though it is likely to accelerate
through Friday afternoon and evening as the river channel fills with
immobile ice.
Since 2010, the river has risen between five and nearly eight feet
during the first icing over event for the winter season, often in
well under 24 hours. As of Friday afternoon, the water level for
the Missouri River at Bismarck is 4.9 feet. Given recent history,
this would suggest the river will be at a stage of between roughly 9
feet and 12 feet once the river ice is in place. Flood stage at the
Bismarck gage on the Missouri River is 14.5 feet.
If you observe problematic high water, please report this to your
local emergency management.</description>
