<headline>Snow Squall Warning issued December 02 at 9:11AM MST until December 02 at 10:00AM MST by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Denver Colorado has issued a
* Snow Squall Warning for...
Northwestern Weld County in northeastern Colorado...
Northeastern Larimer County in north central Colorado...
* Until 1000 AM MST.
* At 910 AM MST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from near Whitaker to 10 miles east of Virginia Dale to 3
miles west of Livermore, or along a line extending from 17 miles
north of Cheyenne to 36 miles southeast of Laramie to 19 miles
northwest of Fort Collins, moving southeast at 50 mph.
HAZARD...Flash freeze on roads. Intense bursts of heavy snow and
gusty winds leading to blowing snow and rapidly falling
visibility. Wind gusts greater than 50 mph.
SOURCE...Radar and webcams.
IMPACT...Dangerous and life-threatening travel conditions are
expected to develop rapidly in the warning area.
This includes Interstate 25 between mile markers 276 and 297.
Locations impacted include...
Wellington, Pierce, Nunn, Carr, Livermore, Rockport and Natural Fort.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads,
bridges, and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and
be prepared for a sudden loss of traction.
Reduce speed and turn on headlights! During snow squalls, the
visibility may suddenly drop to near zero in whiteout conditions.</description>
