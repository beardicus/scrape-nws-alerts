<description>...SNOW SHOWERS POSSIBLE THROUGH EARLY FRIDAY ALONG THE COAST
TILLAMOOK NORTHWARD THROUGH THE SOUTH WASHINGTON COAST...
At 1208 AM PST, latest radar imagery and webcams were showing a
batch of snow showers just about to move onshore into the North
Oregon Coast. With temperatures near or slightly below freezing,
this snow may stick on roads, especially on untreated roads,
bridges, and overpasses. Even locations that do not see snow
showers may still have issues with wet roads refreezing overnight.
Those driving along Highway 101 and other roads northward from
Tillamook should be prepared for snow covered roads and wintry
driving conditions. Snow showers will remain possible through
early Friday morning.</description>
