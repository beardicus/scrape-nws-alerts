<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued March 26 at 10:44AM AKDT until March 27 at 7:00PM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY MORNING
THROUGH SUNDAY EVENING THROUGH SUNDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions possible. Total snow accumulations
of up to 2 inches. North winds 30 to 40 mph with gusts up to
50 mph. Visibilities reduced to one quarter mile at times.
* WHERE...Pribilof Islands.
* WHEN...From Sunday morning through Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...Plan on difficult travel conditions. Areas of
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A low pressure system is expected to move
northward into the southern Bering Sea by Sunday and then
stall through Monday near the Shumagin Islands. On the
backside of this low, gusty northwesterly winds in combination
with falling snow may result in blowing snow and periods when
visibility is reduced to one quarter mile.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Watch for blizzard conditions means there is a
potential for falling and/or blowing snow with strong winds and
extremely poor visibilities. This can lead to whiteout conditions
and make travel very hazardous.</instruction>
