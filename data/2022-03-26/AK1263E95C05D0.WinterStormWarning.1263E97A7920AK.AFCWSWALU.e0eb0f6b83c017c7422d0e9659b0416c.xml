<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 26 at 10:44AM AKDT until March 28 at 10:00AM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 AM SUNDAY TO
10 AM AKDT MONDAY NORTH AND WEST...
* WHAT...Snow and blowing snow expected. Total snow accumulations
of 6 to 10 inches. East winds 30 to 45 mph with gusts as high as
60 mph. Strongest gusts are expected in an area from Koliganek
to New Stuyahok. Visibilities reduced to one half mile or less.
* WHERE...From Dillingham north and west.
* WHEN...From 7 AM Sunday to 10 AM AKDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on difficult travel conditions. Areas of
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow is expected to overspread Bristol Bay
Sunday morning, with the heaviest snow expected Sunday afternoon
through Monday morning. Snowfall rates during this time may
approach one inch per hour. The snow is then expected to
decrease in intensity before tapering off late Monday morning,
though some snow showers may linger through Monday afternoon,
especially across higher terrain. The combination of falling
snow and gusty winds is expected to reduce visibility to one
half mile, though there remains the potential for the visibility
to drop as low as a quarter mile or less at times late Sunday
morning through Sunday afternoon. Areas from King Salmon south
to Port Heiden may see an initial burst of snow, generally less
than one inch, before downsloping takes over Sunday evening.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Warning for snow means severe winter weather
conditions will make travel very hazardous. If you must travel,
keep an extra flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case
of an emergency.</instruction>
