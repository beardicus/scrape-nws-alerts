<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM SUNDAY TO 7 PM
AKDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions expected. Total snow accumulations
of up to 6 inches. Northwest winds 35 to 45 mph with gusts as
high as 60 mph. Visibilities reduced to one quarter mile or
less.
* WHERE...Eastern Aleutians.
* WHEN...From 10 AM Sunday to 7 PM AKDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on difficult travel conditions. Areas of
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Winds will quickly increase Sunday morning.
Strong gusty northwest winds in combination with falling snow
will create blizzard conditions beginning Sunday morning and
continuing through Monday evening. Conditions are expected to
gradually improve Monday evening and into the overnight hours as
the winds diminish and the precipitation tapers off.</description>
<instruction>A Blizzard Warning means severe winter weather conditions are
expected or occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds
and poor visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout
conditions, making travel very hazardous. If you must travel,
have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded, stay
with your vehicle.</instruction>
