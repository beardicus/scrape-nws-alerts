At 115 AM CDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated
thunderstorms producing heavy rain across the warned area. Flash
flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar and automated gauges.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,
highways, streets and underpasses as well as other poor
drainage and low-lying areas.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Amarillo, Canyon, Lake Tanglewood, Mescalero Park, Bushland and
Timbercreek Canyon.
Most of the rain has ended, but still light to moderate rain could
occur in the next hour, and flash flooding from recent rains may
still be an issue for the overnight period.

Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
