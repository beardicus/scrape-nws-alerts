<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued June 08 at 1:28AM CDT until June 08 at 3:45AM CDT by NWS Amarillo</headline>
<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 345 AM CDT EARLY THIS
MORNING FOR WEST CENTRAL ARMSTRONG AND EASTERN RANDALL COUNTIES...
At 128 AM CDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated
thunderstorms producing heavy rain across the warned area. Between
1.5 and 2 inches of rain have fallen. The expected rainfall rate is
0.25 inches in 2 hours. Additional rainfall amounts up to 0.5 inches
are possible in the warned area. Flash flooding is ongoing or
expected to begin shortly.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar and automated gauges.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,
highways, streets and underpasses as well as other poor
drainage and low-lying areas.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Lake Tanglewood and Palo Duro Canyon.
Most of the rain has ended, but still light to moderate rain could
occur over the next couple hours, and flash flooding from recent
rains may still be an issue for the overnight period.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR AND GAUGE INDICATED
EXPECTED RAINFALL RATE...0.25 INCHES IN 2 HOURS</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
