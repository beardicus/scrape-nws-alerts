<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
To escape rising water, take the shortest path to higher ground.
Even 6 inches of fast-moving flood water can knock you off your feet
and a depth of 2 feet will float your car. Never try to walk, swim,
or drive through such swift water. If you come upon flood waters,
stop, turn around and go another way.
