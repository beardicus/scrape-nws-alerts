<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EDT TONIGHT...
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has
issued an Air Quality Health Advisory for the following counties:
Orange and Putnam,
until midnight EDT tonight.
Air quality levels in outdoor air are predicted to be greater than
an Air Quality Index value of 100 for the pollutant of Fine
Particulates. The Air Quality Index, or AQI, was created as an easy
way to correlate levels of different pollutants to one scale. The
higher the AQI value, the greater the health concern.
When pollution levels are elevated, the New York State Department of
Health recommends that individuals consider limiting strenuous
outdoor physical activity to reduce the risk of adverse health
effects. People who may be especially sensitive to the effects of
elevated levels of pollutants include the very young, and those with
preexisting respiratory problems such as asthma or heart disease.
Those with symptoms should consider consulting their personal
physician.
A toll free air quality hotline has been established so New York
residents can stay informed on the air quality situation. The toll
free number is 1 800 5 3 5, 1 3 4 5.</description>
