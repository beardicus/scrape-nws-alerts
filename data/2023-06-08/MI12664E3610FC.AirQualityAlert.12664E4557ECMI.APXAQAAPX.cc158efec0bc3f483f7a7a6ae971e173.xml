<description>...AIR QUALITY ACTION DAY ADVISORY FOR THURSDAY JUNE 8TH AND
FRIDAY JUNE 9TH UNTIL NOON...
The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy has
declared Thursday June 8th and Friday June 9th until noon to be an
action day for elevated levels of fine particulate in southern
Michigan counties. Pollutants within those areas are expected to be
in the unhealthy for sensitive groups range with some hourly
concentrations reaching the unhealthy range.
The action day advisory includes the following northern Michigan
counties:
Gladwin and Arenac.
Smoke originating from wildfires in Quebec and Ontario, Canada are
currently impacting PM2.5 concentrations at the surface across much
of Michigan. The air quality index is expected to range from the
unhealthy for sensitive groups level with some hourly concentrations
reaching the unhealthy level.
It is recommended that active children and adults, and persons with
respiratory diseases such as asthma, limit prolonged outdoor
exertion.
