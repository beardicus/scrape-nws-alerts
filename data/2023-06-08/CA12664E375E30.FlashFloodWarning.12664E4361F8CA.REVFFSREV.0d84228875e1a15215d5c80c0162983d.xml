<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued June 08 at 2:56PM PDT until June 08 at 5:30PM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 530 PM PDT THIS
AFTERNOON FOR ALPINE, EL DORADO AND DOUGLAS COUNTIES...
At 256 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing heavy
rain across the warned area. Between 1.50 and 2.00 inches of rain
has fallen. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through the northeastern part of the Caldor wildfire burn
scar. The debris flow can consist of rock, mud, vegetation and other
loose materials.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,
highways, streets and underpasses as well as other poor
drainage and low-lying areas.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
South Lake Tahoe, Meyers and South Lake Tahoe Airport.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>A Flash Flood Warning for a recent burn area means that flooding
and/or debris flows are imminent or occurring. Residents living in
or immediately downstream should take immediate precautions to
protect life. Quickly move away from the burn area only if it is
safe to do so, otherwise shelter in place and move to a second story
or the highest location in your home to stay out of the path of
fast-moving water and debris flows.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.</instruction>
