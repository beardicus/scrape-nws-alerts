<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EDT FRIDAY NIGHT...
The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection has issued an
Air Quality Action Day for the following counties:
Bergen, Passaic, Hudson, Essex, and Union,
until midnight EDT Friday night.
An Air Quality Action Day for Particulate Matter (PM2.5) has been
declared for Thursday, June 8th. Levels of fine particulates will
remain in the unhealthy category statewide on Thursday and extend
into the evening hours due to wildfire smoke transport from eastern
Canadian wildfires. Some members of the general public may
experience health effects, while members of sensitive groups,
including those with heart or lung disease, the elderly, and the
young, may experience more serious health effects. All individuals
should limit strenuous activities and the amount of time active
outdoors especially in the evening hours. In addition, ozone is
forecast to reach the low moderate category as warm temperatures are
forecast for the Garden State. Â 
An Air Quality Action Day for Particulate Matter (PM2.5) has been
declared for Friday, June 9th. Sensitive individuals, including
those with heart or lung disease, the elderly, and the young should
limit strenuous activities and the amount of time active outdoors.
Levels of fine particulates will remain elevated in the unhealthy for
sensitive groups category statewide on Friday due to residual
Canadian wildfire smoke. Ozone levels are forecast to drop into the
good/moderate threshold on Friday as chances for rain are expected to
help limit ozone formation in northern portions of the state.
