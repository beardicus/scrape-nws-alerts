<description>...CODE ORANGE AIR QUALITY ALERT HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR JEFFERSON AND
SHELBY COUNTIES...
The Alabama Department of Environmental Management, ADEM, has issued
an Air Quality Alert for Jefferson and Shelby Counties for Friday,
June 9.
Under Code Orange conditions, ground level ozone concentrations are
expected to reach levels that are unhealthy for sensitive groups.
Children and people with asthma are individuals most at risk under
these expected conditions.
ADEM recommends the following actions during an air quality alert
for ozone:
Conserve electricity and set your air conditioner at a higher
temperature.
Limit driving and combine errands.
Use the bus or car pool to work.
Avoid use of gasoline power lawn and garden equipment.
Refuel cars and trucks after 6 PM.
Limit engine idling.
Use household, workshop, and garden chemicals in ways that keep
evaporation to a minimum, or try to avoid them when poor air quality
is forecast.
If breathing becomes difficult, move indoors.
