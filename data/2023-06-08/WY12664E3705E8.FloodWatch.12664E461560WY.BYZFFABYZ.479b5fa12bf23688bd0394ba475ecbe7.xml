<headline>Flood Watch issued June 08 at 1:30PM MDT until further notice by NWS Billings</headline>
<description>.Scattered thunderstorms will continue to develop and form across
the area this afternoon, continuing into late tonight. These storms
are forming in a very moist airmass and moving slowly, resulting in
locally very heavy rainfall. Given the saturated soils from recent
rainfall, any precipitation will run off quickly resulting in high
potential for flash flooding near any thunderstorms.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Montana, including the following areas,
Absaroka/Beartooth Mountains, Beartooth Foothills, Bighorn Canyon,
Crazy Mountains, Golden Valley, Judith Gap, Livingston Area,
Melville Foothills, Musselshell, Northeastern Yellowstone,
Northern Big Horn, Northern Carbon, Northern Park, Northern
Rosebud, Northern Stillwater, Northern Sweet Grass, Paradise
Valley, Pryor/Northern Bighorn Mountains, Red Lodge Foothills,
Southeastern Carbon, Southern Big Horn, Southern Rosebud, Southern
Wheatland, Southwestern Yellowstone and Treasure. Portions of
north central Wyoming, including the following areas, Northeast
Bighorn Mountains and Sheridan Foothills.
* WHEN...Through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water
crossings may be flooded. Storm drains and ditches may become
clogged with debris flooding and damaging roads, especially
unpaved rural roads.
Flash flooding and debris flows are possible in and near area burn
scars including the American Fork, BobCat, Peterson, Robertson
Draw, Crooked Creek and Crater Ridge burn areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Scattered slow moving thunderstorms may produce very heavy
rainfall this afternoon through late tonight. Soils are
saturated from recent heavy rainfall, and thus any
precipitation will run off quickly resulting in high
potential for flash flooding near any thunderstorms.
