<headline>Flood Advisory issued June 08 at 5:06PM PDT until June 08 at 5:30PM PDT by NWS Sacramento</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Sacramento has issued a
* Small Stream Flood Advisory for Poor Drainage Areas for...
Northwestern Colusa County in central California...
Southwestern Tehama County in northern California...
Western Glenn County in central California...
* Until 800 PM PDT.
* At 506 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms. This will cause small stream flooding. Overflowing
poor drainage areas will result in minor flooding in the advisory
area.
* Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Alder Springs and Saddle Camp.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.</instruction>
