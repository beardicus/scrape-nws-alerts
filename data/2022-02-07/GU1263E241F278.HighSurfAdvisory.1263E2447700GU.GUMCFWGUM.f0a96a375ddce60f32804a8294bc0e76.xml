<headline>High Surf Advisory issued February 07 at 1:50PM ChST until February 08 at 6:00AM ChST by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM THIS EVENING TO 6 AM
TUESDAY...
...HIGH RISK OF RIP CURRENTS FROM 6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 7 to 9
feet expected in the surf zone. For the High Rip Current Risk,
dangerous rip currents expected.
* WHERE...High Surf Advisory along north facing reefs, high rip
current risk along north and east facing reefs of the Marianas.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, from 6 PM this evening to 6 AM
Tuesday. For the High Rip Current Risk, from 6 PM this evening
through Wednesday afternoon, with the rip risk dropping to moderate
for north facing reefs possibly on Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized
beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Wave models and satellite-derived sea heights
show seas increasing, as the shearline from the north continues to
descend across the Marianas. The combination of an east-northeast
swell, north swell and elevated northeasterly winds will make surf
hazardous along north facing reefs tonight.</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
If caught in a rip current, relax and float. Don`t swim against the
current. If able, swim in a direction following the shoreline. If
unable to escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
