chills. Wind chills as low as 40 below zero.

winds could cause tree damage. The dangerously cold wind
chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as
30 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Ponding could develop after a possible
changeover to rain on Monday afternoon. In areas of deep snow
pack, additional snow and a changeover to rain could challenge
load bearing ability of roof-tops, boats, and aircraft.
Confidence in a rain changeover is lowest in this region.
There is a chance snow could mix with freezing rain at times.</description>
