* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Ponding could develop after a possible
changeover to rain on Monday afternoon. In areas of deep snow
pack, additional snow and a changeover to rain could challenge

Confidence in a rain changeover is lowest in this region.
There is a chance snow could mix with freezing rain at times.</description>
