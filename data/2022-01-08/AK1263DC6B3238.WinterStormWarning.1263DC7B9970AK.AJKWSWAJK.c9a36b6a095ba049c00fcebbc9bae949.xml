<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 08 at 10:50PM AKST until January 10 at 6:00AM AKST by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM AKST
MONDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 12 to
24 inches. Winds gusting as high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...Haines, Haines Highways, and Yakutat.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM AKST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Areas
of blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. Gusty
winds could bring down tree branches and cause power outages.
The dangerously cold wind chills as low as 35 below zero near
White Pass could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little
as 10 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Ponding could develop after a changeover
to rain on Monday, perhaps late Sunday night in Yakutat. In
areas of deep snow pack, additional snow and a changeover to
rain could challenge load bearing ability of roof-tops, boats,
and aircraft. Confidence in a rain changeover is lowest in
this region. There is a chance snow could mix with freezing
rain at times.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
