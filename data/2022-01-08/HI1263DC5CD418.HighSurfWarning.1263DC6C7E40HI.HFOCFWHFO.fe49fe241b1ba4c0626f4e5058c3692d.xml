swell will cause surf to build along exposed north and west facing
shores of the smaller islands through this afternoon. Surf will
likely reach the High Surf Warning criteria along all of these
shorelines by this evening. Surf will also likely reach the High
Surf Advisory criteria along exposed west facing shores of the
Big Island tonight, with surf near the warning criteria there by
Sunday morning.
...HIGH SURF WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM THIS MORNING TO 6 AM HST
SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Building surf, with dangerously large breaking waves of
18 to 25 feet later today, and 20 to 30 feet tonight.
* WHERE...North and west facing shores of Molokai, and north
facing shores of Maui.
* WHEN...From 6 AM this morning to 6 AM HST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...High. Expect ocean water occasionally sweeping across
portions of beaches, very strong breaking waves, and strong
longshore and rip currents. Breaking waves may occasionally
impact harbors making navigating the harbor channel dangerous.</description>
<instruction>Large, breaking surf, significant shorebreak, and dangerous
currents make entering the water very hazardous. Anyone entering
the water could face significant injury or death.</instruction>
