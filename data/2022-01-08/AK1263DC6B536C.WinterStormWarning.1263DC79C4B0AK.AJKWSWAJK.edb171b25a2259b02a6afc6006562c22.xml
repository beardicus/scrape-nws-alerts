<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 08 at 11:35PM AKST until January 09 at 6:00PM AKST by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AKST
SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 6 to
13 inches, with greatest amounts north of Coffman Cove. Winds
gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Petersburg, Wrangell, Kake, Point Baker, Whale Pass,
Coffman Cove, Thorne Bay, Hollis, and Kasaan.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM AKST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Winds
could down trees and cause power outages. Heavy, wet snow will
be difficult to manage. Ponding could develop after a
changeover to rain. In areas of deep snow pack, additional
snow and a changeover to rain could challenge load bearing
ability of roof- tops, boats, and aircraft.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The Ketchikan area saw 6 to 10 inches of
snow and has changed to rain as of 10 pm, but temperatures
remain below freezing further north in Thorne Bay and on the
Prince of Wales Island road system. A change to all rain is
expected on Sunday for most elsewhere. There is a chance of
freezing rain before the change over.</description>
