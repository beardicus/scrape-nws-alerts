<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM THIS EVENING TO
4 AM EST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Freezing drizzle expected. Total ice accumulations of
less than a tenth of an inch of ice accumulation.
* WHERE...Clinton and Ingham counties.
* WHEN...From 6 PM this evening to 4 AM EST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Difficult travel conditions are possible due to icy
roads. Secondary roads, bridges and overpasses, parking lots,
and sidewalks are most susceptible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Freezing drizzle is expected to begin early
tonight and continue into the early morning hours of Sunday
before ending prior to daybreak. Temperatures at the start of
this event will mostly in the mid 20s. Drizzle falling into air
that cold will quickly result in a coating of ice on all
untreated surfaces. While the air temperature is expected to
rise to near freezing south of Route 20 after midnight, the
ground will remain below freezing. That will resulting in icy
conditions on untreated surfaces lingering into mid morning on
Sunday.</description>
