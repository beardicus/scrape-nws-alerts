<headline>High Surf Warning issued January 08 at 3:34AM HST until January 09 at 6:00AM HST by NWS Honolulu</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF WARNING THROUGH TONIGHT FOR NORTH AND WEST FACING
SHORES OF NIIHAU KAUAI OAHU AND MOLOKAI AND FOR NORTH FACING
SHORES OF MAUI...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY STARTING THIS EVENING FOR WEST FACING
SHORES OF THE BIG ISLAND...
.A large northwest swell is spreading down the island chain. This
swell will cause surf to build along exposed north and west facing
shores of the smaller islands through this afternoon. Surf will
likely reach the High Surf Warning criteria along all of these
shorelines by this evening. Surf will also likely reach the High
Surf Advisory criteria along exposed west facing shores of the
Big Island tonight, with surf near the warning criteria there by
Sunday morning.
...HIGH SURF WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM THIS MORNING TO
6 AM HST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Building surf, with dangerously large breaking waves of
20 to 30 feet later today and tonight.
* WHERE...North and west facing shores of Kauai, Oahu, and
Niihau.
* WHEN...From 6 AM this morning to 6 AM HST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...High. Expect ocean water occasionally sweeping
across portions of beaches, very strong breaking waves, and
strong longshore and rip currents. Breaking waves may
occasionally impact harbors making navigating the harbor
channel dangerous.</description>
<instruction>Large, breaking surf, significant shorebreak, and dangerous
currents make entering the water very hazardous. Anyone entering
the water could face significant injury or death.</instruction>
