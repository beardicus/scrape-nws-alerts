<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 08 at 4:05PM AKST until January 10 at 6:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH NOW IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
LATE SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THOMPSON PASS...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions possible. Total snow accumulations of
7 to 14 inches.
* WHERE...Thompson Pass.
* WHEN...From Sunday afternoon through late Sunday night.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Areas of blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility to one quarter mile or
less at times. The dangerously cold wind chills could cause
frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 15 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Wind chills will remain very cold through
Monday morning, fluctuating between 30 and 45 below zero. A
developing storm will bring falling snow back into the area late
Sunday morning. The winds and snow will work in tandem to
reduce visibility, especially Sunday evening.</description>
<instruction>Use caution while traveling outside. Wear appropriate clothing, a
hat, and gloves.
A Winter Storm Watch for blizzard conditions means there is a
potential for falling and/or blowing snow with strong winds and
extremely poor visibilities. This can lead to whiteout conditions
and make travel very hazardous.</instruction>
