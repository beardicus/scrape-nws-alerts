<headline>Wind Chill Advisory issued January 08 at 5:18AM AKST until January 08 at 1:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WIND CHILL ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM AKST THIS
AFTERNOON THROUGH THOMPSON PASS...
...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
LATE SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THOMPSON PASS...
* WHAT...For the Wind Chill Advisory, very cold wind chills.
Wind chills as low as 45 below zero.
For the Winter Storm Watch, blizzard conditions possible. Total
snow accumulations of 7 to 14 inches possible. Winds could gust
as high as 60 mph.
* WHERE...Thompson Pass.
* WHEN...For the Wind Chill Advisory, until 1 PM AKST this
afternoon. For the Winter Storm Watch, from Sunday afternoon
through late Sunday night.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Areas of blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility to one quarter mile or
less at times. The dangerously cold wind chills could cause
frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Wind chills will remain very cold for the
next several days, fluctuating between 35 and 45 below zero. A
developing storm will bring falling snow back into the area
Sunday afternoon. The winds and snow will work in tandem to
reduce visibility, especially Sunday evening.</description>
<instruction>Use caution while traveling outside. Wear appropriate clothing, a
hat, and gloves.
A Winter Storm Watch for blizzard conditions means there is a
potential for falling and/or blowing snow with strong winds and
extremely poor visibilities. This can lead to whiteout conditions
and make travel very hazardous.</instruction>
