<headline>Flood Watch issued October 19 at 4:25AM AKDT  by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...The following areas, Northeast Gulf Coast, Northern Inner
Channels and Central Inner Channels. This includes the cities of
Yakutat, Skagway, Haines, Gustavus, And Juneau.
* WHEN...Through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Area creeks and streams are running high from previous
storms and could flood with more heavy rain. Flooding may occur in
poor drainage areas and at low-water crossings. Storm drains and
ditches may become clogged with debris. Isolated landslides are
possible in areas of steep terrain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The first band of heavier rainfall tracked over the area
Tuesday evening dropping an inch or two or rain. A second
band of rain is moving through the panhandle as of 4 am. The
total rainfall expected from these two bands is around 2 to 4
inches through Wednesday night, with highest amounts at upper
elevations. This combined with the already saturated ground
may cause excessive runoff and some flooding.
- If you live near or along quick responding creeks, stay alert
and be prepared to take action.
- Storm drains should be kept clear of debris as much as possible.
- The ongoing rains could swamp boats. Mariners should check their
vessels periodically.</description>
<instruction>Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared to take
action should flooding develop.
Stay tuned to further developments by listening to your local radio,
television, or NOAA Weather Radio for further information.
Persons living along streams should stay alert and be prepared to
take action if a warning or advisory is issued, or flooding is
observed.</instruction>
