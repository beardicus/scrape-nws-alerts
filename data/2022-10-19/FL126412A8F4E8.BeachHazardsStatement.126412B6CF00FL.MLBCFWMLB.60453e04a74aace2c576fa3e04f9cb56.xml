<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued October 19 at 5:22AM EDT until October 19 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Melbourne</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...A southward flowing longshore current, and a low risk
of rip currents are expected.
* WHERE...Mainland Northern Brevard and Mainland Southern
Brevard Counties.
* WHEN...Through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Fresh northerly winds are producing a strong
southward flowing longshore current, which can knock swimmers
off their feet or into deeper water, making them more
susceptible to dangerous rip currents. The longshore current
will also increase the risk of rip currents near piers and
jetties.</description>
<instruction>Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
