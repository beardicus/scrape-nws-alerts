<description>...STRONG COLD FRONT BRINGS SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THIS WEEKEND WITH
GUSTY WINDS, MUCH COLDER CONDITIONS, VALLEY RAIN/MOUNTAIN SNOW...
* STRONG AND GUSTY WINDS: Southwest winds will begin to increase
Friday afternoon but the strongest winds are expected with the
frontal passage Friday night into Saturday. Gusts of 30-45 mph
are likely in the valleys with gusts possibly exceeding 50 mph
in wind prone locations. Sierra ridgetop gusts could reach
80-100 mph. Impacts from winds include road travel restrictions
due to cross winds especially for high profile vehicles,
aviation turbulence/shear, hazardous boating conditions, and
patchy blowing dust downwind of dry lake beds.
* MUCH COLDER TEMPERATURES: Highs this weekend will be 15-25
degrees lower than this week`s warm conditions, with the brisk
winds making it feel even colder. Widespread freezes are
expected across nearly all areas Saturday night and Sunday
night, with lows mainly in the teens and 20s. Even the urban
areas have at least a 70 percent chance of lows near or below
freezing. Now is the time to have winter clothing handy, finish
harvesting of gardens and fields, and complete winter
protections for exposed irrigation equipment.
* RAIN/SNOW: Bands of showers are expected Saturday from mid-
morning into the evening as the front drops in from the north.
Periods of light rainfall will occur for lower elevations, with
1-4 inches of snowfall possible across Sierra passes Saturday
into Saturday night, as snow levels plummet to around 5000-6000
feet. It only takes a small amount of snow accumulation to
produce travel hazards and long delays across the passes. Be
sure to check with Caltrans and NDOT for the latest road
conditions.</description>
