<description>...Significant Lightning Over Eastern Interior Through Tuesday
Night...
Red Flag Warnings for abundant lightning and extremely dry fuels
are in effect for zones 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225 and
226 this afternoon and evening. Additionally zones 220, 221, 222,
223, 224, 225 and 226 have been extended through Midnight
Tuesday. Thunderstorm activity is still expected Tuesday afternoon
and evening in zones 218 and 219, however lighting levels are not
expected to reach Red Flag Warning criteria in those zones.
Another short wave will move over the area on Wednesday and
combined with fuel conditions that are expected to remain
extremely dry, the Red Flag Warnings may need to be extended into
Wednesday evening as well.
Thunderstorm activity is expected this afternoon and evening with
scattered thunderstorms, along with frequent lightning, hail and
gusty winds, over most of the Eastern and Central Interior. Expect
lightning stroke counts to reach 5000 to 10,000 today with thunderstorm
activity again going through the night. Expect another 5000 to 10000
lighting strokes on Tuesday in the Eastern Interior.
Min RH should be 28-38% across the Eastern Interior this afternoon and
evening, then increase Tue. The Eastern Interior should remain warmer
than normal and relatively dry from Wed through the end of the week.
