areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as
other poor drainage and low-lying areas.

mainly rural areas of West Central Sierra County
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Heavy rainfall will cause extensive and severe flash flooding of
creeks...streams...and ditches in the Burn Scar. Severe debris
flows can also be anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may
be washed away in places. If you encounter flood waters...climb to
safety.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
In hilly terrain there are numerous of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
