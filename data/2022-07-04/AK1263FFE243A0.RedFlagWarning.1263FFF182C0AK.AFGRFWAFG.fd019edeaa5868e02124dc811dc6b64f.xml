<headline>Red Flag Warning issued July 04 at 12:08AM AKDT until July 05 at 12:00AM AKDT by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>...Significant Lightning Over Eastern Interior Through Monday Night...
.Red Flag Warnings for abundant lightning and extremely dry fuels
is in effect through Midnight Monday night for zones 218, 219, 220,
221, 222, 223, 224, 225 and 226. The Red Flag Warnings may need to
be extended through Tuesday night.
A thermal low pressure trough stretching from Northway to Bettles
will remain through Monday then move east to Northway to Arctic
Village on Tue. This will cause very warm and moderately dry
conditions, along with smoke, to continue over the Interior
through Monday, with slight cooling on Tuesday. Expect scattered
high based thunderstorms with poor rain production, gusty winds,
hail, and abundant lightning through early Monday morning,
and again Monday afternoon and evening. Over 9000 lightning strokes
occurred over Northern Alaska Sunday, and Monday is expected
to be similar, with the greatest density of lightning over the
Eastern Interior.
Min RH should be 28-38% across the Eastern Interior Monday, then
increase Tue. The Eastern Interior should remain warmer than normal
and relatively dry from Wed through the end of
the week.
