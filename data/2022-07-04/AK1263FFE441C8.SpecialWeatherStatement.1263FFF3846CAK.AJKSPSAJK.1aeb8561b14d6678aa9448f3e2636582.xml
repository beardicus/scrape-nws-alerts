<headline>Special Weather Statement issued July 04 at 1:14PM AKDT  by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>As temperatures rise into the 80s through mid-week, area rivers and
streams are forecast to rise to bankfull conditions from rapid
snowmelt in higher elevations through at least Wednesday.
For the Taiya River, hikers on the lower portion of the Chilkoot
Trail should note that portions of the Chilkoot Trail could begin to
inundate
with water.
For the Chilkat River, areas around mile post 14 and 16 of the
Haines Highway are the most likely places to experience minor
flooding. This SPS replaces the Flood Advisory that was in effect.
The hottest days are forecast to be on Monday and Tuesday when
temperatures will rise well into the 80s. Records are possible. To
minimize impacts of the heat wave, locate fans for cooling; wear
light-colored and loose fitting clothes when outdoors; drink plenty
of fluids, apply sun protection, and take breaks if you must be
outdoors for extended periods; do not leave young children and pets
unattended in closed vehicles; and plan to check on the elderly,
those who are home-bound, and other loved ones and neighbors who
could be more vulnerable.
This weather pattern has been known to favor the possibility of
thunderstorms during late afternoons and evenings and that potential
will continue to be monitored.
For Chilkat River at Klukwan:
At 12:00pm the stage was 126.42 feet.
Flood Stage is 128.0 feet.
Forecast: A crest around 126.8 feet is expected around 10:00am
Tuesday.
For Taiya River near Skagway:
At 12:00pm the stage was 15.76 feet.
Flood Stage is 16.5 feet.
Forecast: A crest around 16.2 feet is expected around 10:00pm
Tuesday.</description>
