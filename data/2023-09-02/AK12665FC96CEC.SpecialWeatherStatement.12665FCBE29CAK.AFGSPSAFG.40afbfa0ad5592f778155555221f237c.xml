<description>...High Water on the Tanana River and Tributaries Draining the
Alaska Range into Next Week...
High water on the Tanana River and tributaries draining the
Alaska Range will continue into next week. This includes the
Chisana River, Nabesna River, Gerstle River, Delta River, and the
Nenana River. The Tanana River is running at bankfull with minor
flooding possible in low lying area over the several days.
Heavy rain over the Alaska Range the past week has caused high
water on these rivers. Another 0.50 inch to 1.00 inch of rain
fell over much of the Alaska Range Friday into Saturday morning.
This water is now draining into these already high rivers, and
could cause minor flooding over the next several days.
A Flood Advisory is in effect through Noon Monday from Delta
Junction to Old Minto, including Fairbanks and Nenana. A Flood
Watch is in affect through Monday for the Tanana River from Old
Minto to Manley Hot Springs. Please see those products for more
details.
In addition to the high water, many areas east of Delta Junction
could have frost early Sunday.</description>
