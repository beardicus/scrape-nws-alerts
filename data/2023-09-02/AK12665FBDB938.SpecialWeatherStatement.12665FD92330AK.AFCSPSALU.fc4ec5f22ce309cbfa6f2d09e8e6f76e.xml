<description>...ELEVATED WATER LEVELS EXPECTED FOR PORTIONS OF KUSKOKWIM DELTA
COAST FROM TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY EVENING...
Changes since previous statement:
- Areas north of Kipnuk are now expected to see the highest water
levels.
- Elevated water levels at high tide could persist through Sunday
evening for these areas.
A strong frontal system will bring southwesterly gale force winds
with gusts 35 to 45 mph across the Kuskokwim Delta coast through
tonight. The resulting higher seas and surf, in combination with
high tide, could raise water levels as much as 2 to 4 feet above
the normal highest tide.
While much of the Kuskokwim Delta coast will likely see minor
increases in water levels, the biggest impacts are expected north
of Kipnuk, including the communities of Toksook Bay, Tununak, and
Newtok. For these communities, elevated water levels at high tide
could persist from tonight through Sunday evening.
PREPAREDNESS: Residents are encouraged to move items up from the
immediate coastline and monitor water levels in their community.</description>
