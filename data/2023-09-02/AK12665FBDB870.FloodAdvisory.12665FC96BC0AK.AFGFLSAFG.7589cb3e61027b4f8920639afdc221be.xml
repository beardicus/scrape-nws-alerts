<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON AKDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...The Tanana River from Nenana to Old Minto
* WHEN...Until noon AKDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...The Tanana River is bankfull from Nenana to Old Minto
with minor flooding occurring or expected in some low lying areas.
The lower Nenana River at Nenana is also bankfull and may
experience minor flooding. Water levels will remain near minor
flood stage through the weekend and areas around Nenana will
likely see water going overbank into low lying areas near the
river. Additionally, rising groundwater may start to impact crawl
spaces or pond in Nenana. Bankfull conditions are expected to
persist into early next week.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 326 PM AKDT, Heavy rain that fell over the Alaska Range
the past week is causing high water on the Nenana and Tanana
Rivers. Additional heavy rain in the Alaska Range Friday
night will result in more runoff into the Tanana and Nenana
Rivers this weekend, and could cause further rises on the
Tanana and Nenana Rivers.
- For those recreating or hunting on the Tanana and Nenana
Rivers, all gravel bars will be covered with water, debris
will be in the river, along with increased erosion. Be
cautious of rising water levels if you plan to park your
vehicle near the river while out on your boat.
- For Tanana River at Nenana:
At 3;00 pm Saturday the stage was 11.6 feet.
Flood Stage is 12.5 feet.
Forecast: The river will fluctuate near flood stage through
Monday.
