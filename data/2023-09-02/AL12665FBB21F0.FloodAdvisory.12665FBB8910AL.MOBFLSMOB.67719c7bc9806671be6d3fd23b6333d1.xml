<headline>Flood Advisory issued September 02 at 1:36AM CDT until September 02 at 4:00AM CDT by NWS Mobile</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 330 AM CDT EARLY THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of southwest Alabama, including the following
county, Baldwin.
* WHEN...Until 330 AM CDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 133 AM CDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
heavy showers moving repeatedly over the same locations. This
is especially true in urban areas around Foley and along
Highway 59, where some minor flooding will likely develop
shortly. Minor flooding is ongoing or expected to begin
shortly in the advisory area. Between 1 and 2 inches of rain
have fallen.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are expected
over the area. This additional rain will result in minor
flooding and this area will be monitored closely for a flash
flood warning if heavy rainfall continues to persist over
these locations.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Foley, Magnolia Springs, Bon Secour and Marlow.
