<description>...A LAKE EFFECT SNOW BAND WILL AFFECT PARTS OF JEFFERSON...OSWEGO...
AND LEWIS COUNTIES...
HAZARDS...A lake effect snow band accompanied by winds of up to 30
MPH which can rapidly reduce visibility to less than a quarter of a
mile. This lake effect snow band is producing heavy snow at the rate
of 1 to 2 inches per hour.  Drivers heading north on I-81 or Route
11 should be particularly weary of rapidly changing conditions.
LOCATION AND MOVEMENT...At 845 PM EST, the band was located between
Adams and Sandy Creek, then east to Lowville. This area of snow is
beginning to move back to the north this evening. It should move
into Watertown by around 11 PM, but it will also be weakening with
time.
LOCATIONS IMPACTED INCLUDE...
Watertown, Sandy Island Beach State Park, Fort Drum, Stony Point,
Carthage, Lowville, West Carthage, Adams, Dexter, Glen Park,
Herrings, Highmarket, Adams Center, Southwick Beach State Park,
Henderson Harbor, Barnes Corners, Whetstone Gulf State Park, Denmark,
New Bremen and Watson.
This includes Interstate 81 between exits 37 and 49.
SAFETY INFO...
Use extra caution if you must travel into or through this lake effect
snow band. Rapid changes in visibility and potentially slick roads
may lead to accidents.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time to reach your destination.
