and magnitude of the worst cold may continue to fluctuate slightly
over the next couple of days, but at least a portion if not all of
the watch area is expected to see dangerously cold wind chills.

THROUGH LATE SATURDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Dangerously cold wind chills likely. Wind chills as low as
50 below zero possible.
* WHERE...Portions of west central and western Maine. Portions of
northern New Hampshire.
* WHEN...From late Thursday night through late Saturday night.
* IMPACTS...Wind chill values may fall to life threatening levels.</description>
