<headline>Wind Chill Watch issued February 01 at 3:36PM EST until February 04 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Caribou</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH
SATURDAY EVENING...
...WIND CHILL WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
SATURDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Winter Storm Watch, blizzard conditions possible.
Total snow accumulations up to one inch possible. Winds could gust
as high as 45 mph. For the Wind Chill Watch, dangerously cold wind
chills possible. Wind chills as low as 60 below zero.
* WHERE...Northern Penobscot and Southeast Aroostook Counties.
* WHEN...For the Winter Storm Watch, from late Thursday night
through Saturday evening. For the Wind Chill Watch, from Friday
afternoon through Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...Whiteout conditions are possible and may make travel
treacherous and potentially life-threatening. Plan on slippery
road conditions. Areas of blowing snow could significantly reduce
visibility. The hazardous conditions could impact the Friday
morning and evening commutes. Strong winds could cause extensive
damage to trees and power lines. The dangerously cold wind chills
could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 5 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...In addition to low wind chills, areas of
blowing snow could cause whiteout conditions, particularly across
open areas exposed to northwest winds. Blowing and drifting snow
could make travel very difficult. If you must travel have a winter
survival kit and if you get stranded, stay in your vehicle.</description>
<instruction>Persons should consider delaying all travel. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution. Consider taking a winter
storm kit along with you, including such items as tire chains,
booster cables, flashlight, shovel, blankets and extra clothing.
Also take water, a first aid kit, and anything else that would help
you survive in case you become stranded.
A Wind Chill Watch means there is the potential for a combination of
very cold air and the wind to create dangerously low wind chill
values. Monitor the latest forecasts and warnings for updates on
this situation.
Keep pets indoors as much as possible.</instruction>
