<headline>Hydrologic Outlook issued October 09 at 9:41PM ChST  by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...HEAVY RAINFALL POSSIBLE THIS WEEK...
This Hydrologic Outlook is for Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan.
A developing monsoon trough and moderate surge combined with a weak
tropical disturbance is likely to bring locally heavy rain to the
Marianas at times this week. A monsoon trough is in place across
the Marianas, with east winds over Tinian and Saipan and southwest
to west winds for Guam and Rota. The monsoon trough is expected to
move little through Monday night, then drift northward as weak
circulations develop and move west-northwestward, pulling the
trough with them. In addition, a modest monsoon surge is expected
over the region, resulting in increasing rainfall potential. This
surge appears likely to maintain periods of moderate to heavy showers
across the Marianas through most of this week.
Latest model guidance indicates that rainfall through Friday may
exceed 6 inches at one or more of the islands. The situation looks
favorable for locally heavy rainfall capable of producing flash
flooding across the Marianas.
Closely watch this developing situation as watches, advisories or
warnings may be issued at any point during the week. If you live
near a stream or river, be prepared to move away to higher ground.
Make sure storm drains nearby are not clogged.
This outlook will be updated over the next few days with additional
information, or cancelled if the situation changes.</description>
