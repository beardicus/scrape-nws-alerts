<instruction>Arroyos, streams, and normally dry rivers can become raging killer
currents in a matter of minutes. Water in arroyos can travel many
miles and take hours to reach your location from upstream rain areas.
Most flood related deaths occur in automobiles. Do not attempt to
cross water covered bridges, dips, or low water crossings.</instruction>
