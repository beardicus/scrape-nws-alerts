<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued July 07 at 6:46PM MDT until July 07 at 8:45PM MDT by NWS Billings</headline>
<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 845 PM MDT THIS
EVENING FOR SOUTHWESTERN GOLDEN VALLEY, SOUTHEASTERN WHEATLAND AND
NORTHEASTERN SWEET GRASS COUNTIES...
At 646 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms produced
between 1.5 and 3 inches of rain over the warned area. Flash
flooding is likely ongoing. While precipitation has ended, it will
take some time for the water to work into area streams and move
downstream as well as subside in areas of poor drainage.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, roads, as
well as other poor drainage and low-lying areas.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
mainly rural areas of Southwestern Golden Valley, Southeastern
Wheatland and Northeastern Sweet Grass Counties
This includes the following streams and drainages...
Simmons Creek, Mud Creek, Fish Creek, Rock Creek, Cherry Creek,
Big Coulee Creek and Spring Creek.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Move to higher ground now. Act quickly to protect your life.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles. Do not drive on or attempt to cross
flooded roads, find an alternate route. Roads and driveways may be
damaged or washed out in places.
Remain alert for flooding of creeks, streams, and normally dry
coulees even in areas not receiving rainfall downstream. These can
become raging killer currents in a matter of minutes even from
distant rainfall upstream.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency officials and
request they pass the information to the National Weather Service in
Billings.</instruction>
