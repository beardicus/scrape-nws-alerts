<headline>Flood Watch issued July 07 at 9:20AM MDT  by NWS Glasgow</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT THROUGH EARLY FRIDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of northeast Montana, including the following
areas, Central and Southeast Phillips, Central and Southern
Valley, Daniels, Dawson, Eastern Roosevelt, Garfield, McCone,
Northern Phillips, Northern Valley, Petroleum, Prairie, Richland,
Sheridan, Southwest Phillips, Western Roosevelt and Wibaux.
* WHEN...Through early Friday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage areas. Low-water crossings may
be flooded. Extensive street flooding and flooding of creeks and
rivers are possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Several days in a row of Severe Weather, including storms
producing heavy rains over a short period of time, combined
with the current deep moist atmosphere over northeast Montana
primes the region for another day of Severe Thunderstorms
producing torrential rainfall. Water loaded ground conditions
only exacerbate the concerns that runoff will be excessive
with storms this afternoon through Friday morning and could
quickly lead to Flash Flooding in areas experiencing these
torrential rainfalls.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action
should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.</instruction>
