drainage area including Cabo Lucero Creek, Canon Mesteno, Ojitos
Frios Creek, Gallina Creek and Tecolote Creek feeding into the
Gallinas River. Any debris flows can consist of water, ash, soot,
rock, mud, burned vegetation and other loose materials.

southeastern portion of the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon
Burn Scar.
SOURCE...Radar.
