<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued March 05 at 10:13AM CST until March 06 at 11:00AM CST by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...SNOW ACCUMULATES TONIGHT, WITH LIGHTER SNOW BUT CONTINUED
IMPACTS DURING THE MONDAY MORNING COMMUTE...
.The bulk of the snow accumulations are expected overnight into
early Monday morning, with mainly lighter accumulations by daytime
Monday. The Monday morning commuter period is going to be the
main concern due to wet slushy snow and gusty winds. The wet and
heavy nature of the snow means that even locations that see lower
snow amounts will likely still see travel impacts.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM THIS
AFTERNOON TO 11 AM CST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 2 to 4
inches.
* WHERE...Portions of eastern Minnesota and western Wisconsin in
and around the Twin Cities metro area.
* WHEN...From 4 PM this afternoon to 11 AM CST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning commute.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
The latest road conditions for the state you are calling from can
be obtained by calling 5 1 1. Road conditions can also be found
