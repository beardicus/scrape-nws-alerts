<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM PST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Periods of heavy snow showers. Additional snow
accumulations of 2 to 8 inches. Winds gusting as high as 70 mph
across Sierra ridgelines with gusts up to 30 mph in the Tahoe
Basin.
* WHERE...Greater Lake Tahoe Area.
* WHEN...Until 4 AM PST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Strong

and drifting snow may bring near zero visibility at times and
rapid disorientation if attempting to travel. Lake waters will
be rough and hazardous.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Additional snow loading on top of very deep
existing snowpack may create unusual hazards including, but not
limited to: structural instabilities, roofalanches, fire hydrant
access problems, delayed first responders, and shelter in place
orders. Snow totals may be highly variable over short distances
due to the showery nature of the storm.</description>
<instruction>Avoid travel if possible, you could be stuck in your vehicle for
many hours. If you must travel, prepare for long delays and carry
an emergency kit with extra food, water and clothing. If you stay
home, have a backup plan in case of power outages.
