<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued March 05 at 2:55AM CST until March 06 at 11:00AM CST by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...SNOW ACCUMULATES SUNDAY NIGHT, WITH LIGHTER SNOW BUT CONTINUED
IMPACTS DURING THE MONDAY MORNING COMMUTE...
.The bulk of the snow accumulations are expected overnight Sunday
into early Monday morning, with mainly lighter accumulations by
daytime Monday. The Monday morning commuter period is going to be
the main concern due to wet slushy snow and gusty winds. The wet
and heavy nature of the snow means that even locations that see
lower snow amounts will likely still see travel impacts.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO
11 AM CST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 3
inches. Winds gusting as high as 30 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of central, east central, south central and
southeast Minnesota and west central Wisconsin.
* WHEN...From 4 PM this afternoon to 11 AM CST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Patchy blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning commute.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
The latest road conditions for the state you are calling from can
be obtained by calling 5 1 1. Road conditions can also be found
at 511mn.org for Minnesota or 511wi.gov for Wisconsin.</instruction>
