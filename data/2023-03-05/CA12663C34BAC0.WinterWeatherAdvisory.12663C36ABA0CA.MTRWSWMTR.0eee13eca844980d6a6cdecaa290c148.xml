<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST MONDAY...

tonight and Monday morning resulting in light snow accumulations
ranging from a light dusting to 2 to 4 inches mainly above 1500

accumulations may near 5 to 7 inches tonight and Monday morning.
Snow and ice on roadways that traverse Bay Area passes may become
