evening and into Monday. Much of the snowfall looks to remain

wintry mix before the precipitation changes to rain or mixes in
with rain. A slight shift south has been noted, so additional
refinements may be needed with future updates.
Travel impacts are expected with the falling snow and brisk east
winds gusting to 25 to 35 mph tonight and Monday morning.
