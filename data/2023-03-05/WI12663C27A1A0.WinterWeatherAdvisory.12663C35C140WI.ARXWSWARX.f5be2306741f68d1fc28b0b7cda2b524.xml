<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued March 05 at 1:44PM CST until March 06 at 6:00AM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Wet Accumulating Snow Tonight...
.Rain or snow will develop late this afternoon or evening,
transitioning to snow, with the highest impact period expected
from this evening into early Monday morning. The highest totals
are still expected near and north of Interstate 94 with lighter
totals south into the Interstate 90 corridor where more rain or
mixed precipitation may occur.
Rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour will be possible for a few hours
this evening, especially north of Interstate 94, resulting in
quick accumulations on roads and slick, difficult travel. Light
mixed precipitation could persist into Monday along with gusty
winds. Although most of the accumulating snow will be done by
sunrise, some travel impacts for the Monday morning commute are
possible.
