<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WILL AFFECT NORTH CENTRAL TOOELE COUNTY...
At 437 PM MST...A snow squall was 9 miles northeast of Utah Test and
Training Range South, or 30 miles east of Wendover...moving northeast
at 15 mph.
Locations impacted include...
Knolls and Utah Test and Training Range South.
This includes Interstate 80 in Utah between mile markers 28 and 49.
* winds in excess of 35 mph are possible with this squall.
* visibilities will drop quickly to less than a half mile in this
squall.
Rapid visibility reduction and potentially icy roads are likely to
produce hazardous driving conditions. Travel is not advised during
this snow squall. If you are traveling and encounter adverse winter
driving conditions, reduce speed and make sure headlights are on to
increase the visibility of your vehicle to those around you.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time when traveling.</description>
