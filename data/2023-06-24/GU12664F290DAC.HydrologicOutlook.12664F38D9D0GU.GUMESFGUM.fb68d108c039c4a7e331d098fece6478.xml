<description>...HEAVY RAINFALL AND GUSTY WINDS POSSIBLE DUE TO A TROPICAL
DISTURBANCE FROM SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...
A weak tropical disturbance is projected to develop along the eastern
periphery of the monsoon trough in Chuuk State in the coming days.
The monsoon trough is expected to shift northward and is expected to
take this disturbance north and across the Marianas. Both
deterministic and ensemble model guidance are in much better
agreement on the approximate location of a building convergence zone,
and the time of arrival of the heaviest showers, which is currently
projected to be late Sunday - Monday night time frame. Rainfall
amounts remain highly uncertain due to lack of visible feature on
satellite to prognose; however, vertical environmental profiles in
the soundings and model time heights indicate amounts between 2 and 4
inches with locally heavier amounts in excess of 5 inches possible
through Tuesday. As the evolution of this feature changes
significantly with the last few forecast cycles, possibilty remains
for an elevation to a Flood Watch for the Marianas in the next day or
two, if conditions warrant.
Localized flooding is possible in low-lying and poor drainage areas,
while flash flooding will be possible in areas of heaviest rainfall,
especially near steep terrain. Residents of the Marianas need to
closely monitor this developing situation as hydrologic watches,
advisories and warnings could be issued this weekend. If living near
streams and rivers, prepare to move items away from stream and river
banks. Make sure storm drains nearby are not clogged, especially in
low-lying areas.
This outlook will be updated over the next few days with additional
information, or cancelled if the situation changes.</description>
