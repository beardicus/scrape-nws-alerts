<description>...STRONG WINDS EXPECTED FOR THE UPPER HILLSIDE OF ANCHORAGE,
TURNAGAIN ARM, AND PORTAGE VALLEY SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY
MORNING...
Southeasterly winds will be on the increase beginning late
Saturday afternoon as a strong, fall-like storm system moves
toward the western Gulf of Alaska. These winds are expected to
continue to increase through the overnight hours, peaking Sunday
morning, as a frontal system moves into Prince William Sound. The
winds are then expected to slowly diminish through Sunday
afternoon and evening; however, it will continue to remain breezy
through Turnagain Arm into early Monday morning.
Sustained winds of 25 to 40 mph with gusts up to 55 mph are
expected late Saturday night through Sunday morning through
Turnagain Arm and Portage Valley. Winds of 20 to 30 mph with gusts
up to 55 mph are expected for the Upper Hillside of Anchorage.
High profile vehicles traveling the Seward Highway corridor
through Turnagain Arm Saturday afternoon through Sunday should
use extra caution as wind gusts could be very strong and erratic.
Up to 2 inches of rain is also possible Saturday night through
Sunday for Portage Valley. The combination of steady rain and
strong winds may make for difficult driving conditions at times.
