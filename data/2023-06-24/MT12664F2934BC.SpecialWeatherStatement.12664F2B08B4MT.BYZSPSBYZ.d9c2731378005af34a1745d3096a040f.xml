<description>...High Water on the Bighorn River with Flooding Possible...
The Bighorn River at St. Xavier was running at 15,700 cfs Friday
night, which is likely resulting in some low land flooding in spots
along the river as well as significant bank erosion. Over the next
24 hours, periods of light to moderate rainfall is expected along
the river, with up to another inch of rain possible. This rain may
result in additional rises on the Bighorn River as small creeks
drain into it.
Those with interests along the Bighorn River should be prepared for
flooding from both heavy rainfall and additional rises on the river.
Significant bank erosion will be an ongoing issue until water levels
recede to more normal levels. Areas north of the confluence with the
Little Bighorn River should be especially alert.
If flooding is encountered please report it to local law enforcement
and have them relay the report to the National Weather Service in
Billings.
Locations impacted include... Hardin, Fort Smith, St. Xavier and
Crow Indian Reservation.
