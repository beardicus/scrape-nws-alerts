Dilworth Creek.

FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Life threatening flooding of creeks, roads, and normally dry coulees
in and downstream of the Robertson Draw Burn Area burn area is
likely. In addition to the flash flooding, the heavy rains may
trigger rockslides, mudslides, and debris flows in steep terrain.
Remain alert for flooding of creeks, streams, and normally dry
coulees even in areas not receiving rainfall downstream of the burn
area. These can become raging killer currents in a matter of minutes
even from distant rainfall upstream.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency officials and
request they pass the information to the National Weather Service in
Billings.</instruction>
