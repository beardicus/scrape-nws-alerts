<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT THROUGH 9 AM CDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has issued an Air
Quality Alert for fine particle pollution. The Air Quality Index
(AQI) is expected to reach the Orange or Unhealthy for Sensitive
Groups category.
* WHERE...Northeast Minnesota.
* WHEN...Through 9 AM CDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease
(including asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults, may
experience health effects.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Northerly winds have brought smoke from
wildfires located north of the Canadian border in Ontario into
northern MN. This batch of smoke will be heavier and more
persistent closer to the Canadian border, while the southern
portion of the alert area may see occasional smoke. Smoke will
continue over northern Minn. for the rest of Saturday, Sunday, and
early Monday.
People should keep windows shut to prevent smoke from entering. Smoke
will circulate around the northern periphery of a low-pressure area
heading eastward through Minn. Some smoke may linger on Monday but
concentrations should fall below orange. Fine particle levels are
expected to be in the orange AQI category, a level that is considered
unhealthy for sensitive groups, in north Minn. In the orange area,
sensitive groups should avoid prolonged time outdoors. The alert area
includes International Falls, Two Harbors, Hibbing, Ely, Duluth, and
the tribal nations of Red Lake, Leech Lake, Grand Portage, and Fond
du Lac. In the orange area, sensitive groups should avoid prolonged
time outdoors.
