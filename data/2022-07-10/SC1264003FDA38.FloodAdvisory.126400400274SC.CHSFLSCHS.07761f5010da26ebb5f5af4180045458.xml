<headline>Flood Advisory issued July 10 at 5:42PM EDT  by NWS Charleston</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of southeast South Carolina, including the
following counties, Berkeley and Charleston.
* WHEN...Until 700 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 534 PM EDT, showers and thunderstorms producing heavy
rainfall were located from Hollywood, across Downtown
Charleston, and into portions of Mount Pleasant. Between 3
and 5 inches of rain have fallen across portions of West
Ashely, North Charleston, Daniel Island, and Mount Pleasant.
An additional 1 to 2 inches are possible across the advisory
area, with an isolated 2 to 3 inches possible across portions
of John and James Islands. High tide will peak around 6 PM,
resulting in slow draining of rain water on urban streets.
High rainfall rates have been observed with these showers and
thunderstorms and will likely cause roads in Downtown
Charleston to quickly flood and possibly impassible.
In addition, rapid rises have been observed at Church Creek
near West Ashely. At around 530 PM water levels were observed
a little over 4 feet and steadily rising. Flood stage is 5.5
feet.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
North Charleston, Mount Pleasant, Goose Creek, Hanahan, West
Ashley, Downtown Charleston, James Island, I-26/I-526
Interchange, Johns Island, Daniel Island, Fort Sumter,
Hollywood, Isle Of Palms, Folly Beach, Ravenel, Sullivan`s
Island, Meggett, Charles Towne Landing, Maybank Bridge and
James Island County Park.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Heavy rain in Downtown Charleston will result in nuisance flooding
of low-lying areas. Areas most prone to flooding include the Market,
Crosstown, East Bay Street and Morrison Drive. Slow down when
traveling and allow extra distance between you and the vehicle
ahead. Do not drive into water of unknown depth.</instruction>
