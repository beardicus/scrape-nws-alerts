.DISCUSSION...
A thermal trough stretching from McGrath to Fairbanks to Eagle
will persist into Monday. This, along with a warm and unstable

isolated thunderstorms across the Eastern Interior, with scattered
thunderstorms in the afternoon/evening over the area south of
Fort Yukon through Monday night. Expect 3000 to 5000 lightning
strokes each day. In addition, these troughs will cause
significant rain showers over areas southeast of a line from Eagle
to Kantishna through Monday night.
