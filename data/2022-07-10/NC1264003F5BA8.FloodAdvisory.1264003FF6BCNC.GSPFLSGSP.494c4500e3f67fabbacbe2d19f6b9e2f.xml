<headline>Flood Advisory issued July 10 at 2:18PM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 815 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Nuisance to minor flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
expected.
* WHERE...A portion of western North Carolina, including the
following counties, southwest Haywood, northern Jackson and
east-central Swain.
* WHEN...Until 815 PM EDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Rapid rises in small headwater streams will result in
dangerous flows over low-water crossings. Some low-water crossings
may become impassable.  Expect small driveway culverts to become
overwhelmed and possibly compromised by high drainage flow due to
excessive runoff.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 210 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms. Between 1 and 2 inches of rain have fallen
over the past 1-2 hours.  Nuisance to Minor flooding is
imminent portions of southwest Haywood, northern Jackson
and east-central Swain County. Areas of greatest concern are
along Dicks Creek near Dillsboro, Scotts Creek near Sylva,
Dark Ridge Creek, Soco Creek east of Cherokee, Jonathans
Creek near Maggie Valley, Richland Creek southwest of
Waynesville, and the West Fork Pigeon River near Sunburst.
Residents along these streams and associated smaller
drainages should be prepared to seek higher ground due to
rapid rises and scattered bankfull exceedances.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are possible
over the area. This additional rain will increase excessive
runoff and may exacerbate ongoing flooding or cause new areas
of flooding to develop.  If this rainfall materializes, a
portion or all of the Advisory area may be upgraded to a
Flash Flood Warning.  Please stay weather aware.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Sylva, Waynesville, Bryson City, Cherokee, Lake Junaluska,
Maggie Valley, Balsam, Webster, Dillsboro, Oconaluftee, and
Deep Creek.

<instruction>In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
