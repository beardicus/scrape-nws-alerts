<description>...KING TIDES WILL CAUSE MINOR COASTAL FLOODING AT LOW LYING
SPOTS DURING HIGH TIDE TONIGHT TO EARLY MONDAY MORNING...
.The highest astronomical tides of the year, commonly referred to
as the King Tides, will again impact the coast and bayshore
this evening through early Sunday night and have historically
resulted in the localized flooding of specific low lying areas
each year. In addition, the lowest low tides of the event will
be observed during the morning hours that may lead to trouble for
mariners navigating shallow waterways. The King Tides tidal
readings are expected to peak Wednesday night.
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM THIS EVENING TO
MIDNIGHT PDT TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Minor coastal flooding expected at prone low lying
coastal locations across the San Francisco Bay shoreline during
peak high tide tonight.
* WHERE...Low lying portions of the San Francisco Bayshore.
Localized impacts are also possible in low lying areas along
the Pacific shore as well.
* WHEN...From 7 PM this evening to midnight PDT tonight. Please
refer to local tidal data forecasts available for several
coastal and bayshore locations at www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of areas previously impacted by King Tide
events is expected, including low lying lots, parks, and roads
throughout the San Francisco Bay Shoreline with the highest high
tides. Difficulty navigating shallow bay waters during the
lowest low tides.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Tidal levels will also rise along the
Pacific coast but impacts will be more localized to areas along
the SF Bay shoreline. Tide poolers and beachgoers should be
familiar with the times and heights of local tidal levels to
avoid hazards that may arise from rapidly shifting water levels.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
