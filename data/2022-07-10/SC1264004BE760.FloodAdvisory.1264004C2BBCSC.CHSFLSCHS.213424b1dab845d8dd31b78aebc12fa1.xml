following county, Charleston.
* WHEN...Until 1030 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 831 PM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gages
indicate that between 3 and 6 inches of rain has fallen
across Downtown Charleston today. Emergency Management
reported that numerous roads across Downtown Charleston
remained closed due to flooding. Flood waters are expected to
slowly drain this evening. However, roads will remain flooded
well into the nighttime hours.
- Additional showers will pass across Downtown Charleston,
possibly producing enough rainfall to slow the recede of
flood waters.

North Charleston, Downtown Charleston, Daniel Island, West
Ashley, Columbus Street Terminal, Medical University Of South
Carolina, Marion Square, The Citadel and Cooper River Marina.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Areas most prone to flooding across Downtown Charleston include the
Market, Crosstown, East Bay Street and Morrison Drive. Slow down
when traveling and allow extra distance between you and the vehicle
ahead. Do not drive into water of unknown depth.</instruction>
