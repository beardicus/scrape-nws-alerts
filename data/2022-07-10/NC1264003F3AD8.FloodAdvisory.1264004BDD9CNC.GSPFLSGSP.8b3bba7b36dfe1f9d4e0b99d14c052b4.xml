<headline>Flood Advisory issued July 10 at 1:34PM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 730 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Nuisance to minor flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
expected.
* WHERE...A portion of western North Carolina, including the
following counties, Jackson, Macon and Swain.
* WHEN...Until 730 PM EDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Rapid rises in small headwater streams will result in
dangerous flows over low-water crossings. Some low-water crossings
may become impassable.  Expect small driveway culverts to become
overwhelmed and possibly compromised by high drainage flow due to
excessive runoff.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 126 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms. Between 1 and 3 inches of rain have fallen
over the past 1-2 hours.  Nuisance to Minor flooding is
imminent portions of northeast Macon, west central Jackson
and southeast Swain County. Areas of greatest concern are
along Burningtown Creek near Burningtown and Iotla in Macon
County, Alarka Creek in Swain County, and Barkers, Savannah,
and Cullowhee creeks in Jackson County.  Residents along
these streams and associated smaller drainages should be
prepared to seek higher ground due to rapid rises and
scattered bankfull exceedances.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches is possible over
the area. This additional rain will increase excessive runoff
and may exacerbate ongoing flooding or cause new areas of
flooding to develop.  If this rainfall materializes, a
portion or all of the Advisory area may be upgraded to a
Flash Flood Warning.  Please stay weather aware.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Franklin, Cullowhee, Webster, Dillsboro, Fontana Lake, Cowee,
Alarka, Savannah, Burningtown, Cullasaja, Ellijay, Luada,
Almond and Tuckasegee.

<instruction>In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
