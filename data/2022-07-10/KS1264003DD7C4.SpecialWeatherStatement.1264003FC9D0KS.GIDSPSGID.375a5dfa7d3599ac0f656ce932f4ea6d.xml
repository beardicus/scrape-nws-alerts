<description>...Near-Critical Fire Weather Conditions Likely This Afternoon
Into Early This Evening...
Although a formal Warning is not in effect mainly due to
vegetation/grasses not being as conducive to widespread fire
growth during the summer as they often are during other times of
the year, solidly near-critical fire weather conditions are
likely this afternoon and early evening. This will be due to the
combination of southerly winds gusting to around 25 MPH, along
with very hot temperatures and dry air driving relative humidity
values down as low as 15 to 20 percent.
As a result, caution is advised this afternoon and early evening
if engaging in any activity that could possibly spark a wildfire.</description>
