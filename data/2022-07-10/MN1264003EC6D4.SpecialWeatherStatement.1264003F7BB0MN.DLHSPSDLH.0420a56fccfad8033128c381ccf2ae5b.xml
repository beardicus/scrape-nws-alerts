<description>...STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS WILL AFFECT THE BOUNDARY WATERS
CANOE AREA WILDERNESS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...
Strong to severe thunderstorms may affect the Boundary Waters
Canoe Area Wilderness this afternoon and evening. The storms will
be capable of erratic and gusty winds of 50 to 70 mph, hail up to
two inches in diameter, frequent cloud-to-ground lightning, and
locally heavy rainfall, which may lead to localized flooding of
creeks, streams, and low-lying areas. A tornado can`t be ruled
out.
Campers should take extra precautions in order to secure
campsites and make a plan in case of severe weather. Check
campsites for possible hazards, including standing dead trees or
limbs, as well as low spots where water can pool. Move tents away
from creeks and rivers in case of flash flooding. Prepare to
protect yourself from large hail using sleeping bags or other
padded items. Monitor NOAA Weather Radio for updates and possible
warnings.</description>
