<headline>Flood Advisory issued July 10 at 4:25PM EDT  by NWS Charleston</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 545 PM EDT THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of southeast South Carolina, including the
following counties, Berkeley and Charleston.
* WHEN...Until 545 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 419 PM EDT, a line of thunderstorms was located from
Cainhoy to West Ashley producing heavy rainfall. Minor
flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly in the
advisory area. Between 2 and 4 inches of rain have fallen,
mainly across Daniel Island and Mount Pleasant.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are expected
over the area by 530 PM. High tide will peak around 6 PM,
resulting in slow drainage of rain water on urban streets.
These high rainfall rates will result in roads in Downtown
Charleston to quickly flood and possibly impassible.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
North Charleston, Mount Pleasant, Daniel Island, Fort Sumter,
Downtown Charleston, James Island, West Ashley, Johns Island,
Isle Of Palms, Sullivan`s Island, Mount Pleasant Towne
Centre, Boone Hall Plantation, Sullivans Island, Fort
Johnson, Charleston Naval Complex, Mount Pleasant Regional
Airport, Cainhoy, Wando, Charles Towne Landing and Maybank
Bridge.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Heavy rain in Downtown Charleston will result in nuisance flooding
of low-lying areas. Areas most prone to flooding include the Market,
Crosstown, East Bay Street and Morrison Drive. Slow down when
traveling and allow extra distance between you and the vehicle
ahead. Do not drive into water of unknown depth.</instruction>
