* Until 745 PM EDT.
* At 404 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing
heavy rain across the warned area. Between 1.5 and 2.5 inches of
rain have fallen. The expected rainfall rate is 1 to 2 inches in 1

flooding is already occurring, and worsened or new areas of
flooding are anticipated as more heavy rain moves into the warned
area.

Providence are flooded and impassable, including a
portion of Pawtucket Ave near Allerton Ave. Oaklawn
Ave in Cranston is also flooded and impassable per

IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban
areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as
other poor drainage and low-lying areas.
