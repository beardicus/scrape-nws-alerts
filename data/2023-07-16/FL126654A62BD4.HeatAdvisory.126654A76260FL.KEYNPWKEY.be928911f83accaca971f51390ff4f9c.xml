* WHAT...Heat index values up to 112 expected.
* WHERE...Florida Keys.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM EDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...A Heat Advisory means that a period of unusually hot
temperatures and high humidity is expected, producing heat
index values of 108 degrees or higher. These conditions will
cause increased risk of heat illness for people outdoors or in
non air conditioned spaces.</description>
<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible, reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when possible
and drink plenty of water.
To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent rest breaks
in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone overcome by
heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location. Heat stroke
is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
