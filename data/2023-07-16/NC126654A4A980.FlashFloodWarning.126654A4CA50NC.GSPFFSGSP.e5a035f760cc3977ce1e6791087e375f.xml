<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM EDT EARLY THIS
MORNING FOR BURKE COUNTY...
At 1216 AM EDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain had ended across
the warned area.  Widespread rain amounts ranged from 2.5 to 3.5
inches across a good chunk of Burke County.  Elevated stream levels
and flooding of low lying areas along select drainages of the upper
Catawba will linger before receding overnight.  High water
conditions around Greater Morganton and along portions of the
Highway 70 corridor linger as well, but will also diminish gradually
overnight.  This warning will expire on schedule at 1 am.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,
highways, streets and underpasses as well as other poor
drainage and low-lying areas.  Please remain aware of
the likelihood of encountering flooded roads and
elevated streams and creeks.
Some locations that may experience lingering flooding include...
Morganton, Valdese, Salem, Drexel, Connelly Springs, Rutherford
College, Glen Alpine, Table Rock, Lake James State Park, Lake
James, South Mountains State Park, Lake Rhodhiss and Oak Hill.
