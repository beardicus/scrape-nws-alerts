<headline>Flood Advisory issued July 16 at 4:14AM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 715 AM EDT THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Small stream flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
expected.
* WHERE...A portion of western North Carolina, including the
following counties, Burke and Caldwell.
* WHEN...Until 715 AM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
River or stream flows are elevated.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 409 AM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated heavy rain due to earlier thunderstorms. This is
causing small stream flooding. Between 3 and 6 inches of rain
fell Saturday evening, which has caused Lower Creek to rise
above bankfull in some locations.
- In particular, the stream gage on Lower Creek at Lenoir had
reached 10.62 feet at 4 am and was rising slowly.  Flood
stage is 11 feet. High water conditions will continue along
Lower Creek as it flows down into northern Burke County and
the water will eventually recede in the pre-dawn hours.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Lenoir and Gamewell.
