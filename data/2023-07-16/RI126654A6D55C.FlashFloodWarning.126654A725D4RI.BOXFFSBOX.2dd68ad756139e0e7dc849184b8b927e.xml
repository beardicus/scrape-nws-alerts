<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued July 16 at 2:39PM EDT until July 16 at 4:45PM EDT by NWS Boston</headline>
<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 445 PM EDT THIS
AFTERNOON FOR EAST CENTRAL WINDHAM, SOUTHWESTERN BRISTOL, BRISTOL,
KENT, NEWPORT, PROVIDENCE AND WASHINGTON COUNTIES...
At 239 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing heavy
rain across the warned area. Between 1.5 and 2.5 inches of rain have
fallen. The expected rainfall rate is 1 to 2 inches in 1 hour. While
rainfall rates have started to level off from earlier excessive
levels, additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches are possible,
as heavy rains and embedded thunderstorms over Long Island New York
will move into the warned area. Flash flooding is already occurring,
and worsened or new areas of flooding are anticipated as more heavy
rain moves into the warned area.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Law enforcement and trained weather spotters. Law
enforcement reports several roads in East Providence are
flooded and impassable, including a portion of Pawtucket
Ave near Allerton Ave. Oaklawn Ave in Cranston is also
flooded and impassable per trained spotters.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of urban areas, highways, streets and
underpasses as well as other poor drainage and low-lying
areas. Urban flash flooding is likely in Providence and
Cranston areas. Sharp rises to potentially over bankfull
are likely on streams and creeks.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Providence, Fall River, Warwick, Cranston, Pawtucket, East
Providence, Woonsocket, Coventry, Cumberland, North Providence,
South Kingstown, West Warwick, Johnston, North Attleborough, North
Kingstown, Newport, Bristol, Attleboro, Westerly and Smithfield.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
EXPECTED RAINFALL RATE...1-2 INCHES IN 1 HOUR</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Move to higher ground now. Act quickly to protect your life.
Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.</instruction>
