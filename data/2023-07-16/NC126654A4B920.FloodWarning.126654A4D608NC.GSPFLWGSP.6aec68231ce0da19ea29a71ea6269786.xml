- At 1248 AM EDT, The threat of additional rain had ended, but
locally excessive runoff continued.  As floodwaters route
through tributaries and headwater basins into the larger

flooding of low-lying areas along select tributaries of the
Catawba River such as Lower Creek and the Upper, Middle and
Lower Little Rivers.
