<headline>Flood Advisory issued February 13 at 1:56AM EST  by NWS Blacksburg</headline>
<description>.Widespread significant rainfall fell across the region Sunday.
Much of the upper Roanoke River basin saw between 2 and 3 inches of
rain during the past 24 hours. This has resulted in excessive runoff
into area creeks, streams, and rivers causing water levels to rise.
Although the rain has stopped, it will take several hours for water
levels to reach their peak levels and then recede through the later
morning hours.

* WHAT...Minor flooding from earlier heavy rainfall and associated
water runoff.
* WHERE...Western Roanoke County between the Montgomery County line
and Salem, including areas such as Glenvar and Fort Lewis.
* WHEN...Until 545 AM EST.
* IMPACTS...River or stream flows are elevated. Overflowing poor
drainage areas can be expected. In addition, some low-water
crossings may become impassable, especially adjacent to any
creeks, streams, or rivers.

<instruction>Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
When it is safe to do so, please send your reports of flooding,
including mudslides or flooded roads, to the National Weather
Service by calling toll free at 1...8 6 6...2 1 5...4 3 2 4. Reports
and pictures can also be shared on the National Weather Service
Blacksburg Facebook page and on Twitter.</instruction>
