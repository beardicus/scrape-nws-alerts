<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 5 AM TO 11 PM MST
TUESDAY ABOVE 4000 FEET...
* WHAT...Snow expected above 4000 feet. Total snow accumulations
of a dusting in the lowest elevations and up to 5 inches in
higher elevations. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph out of the
southwest, shifting north on Tuesday afternoon.
* WHERE...Northwest Deserts including Kingman, Dolan Springs,
Wikieup, and the Hualapai Mountains.
* WHEN...From 5 AM to 11 PM MST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Potentially hazardous road conditions where snow
accumulates on any roadways. High wind gusts coupled with
falling snow could result in low visibility due to blowing snow.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...While accumulations are expected to be
minor, there is about a 40% chance for 2 or more inches to
accumulate on parts of Interstate 40 near Fort Rock. This could
also occur in an hour or two. This would result in hazardous
driving conditions for anyone traveling on the Interstate and
accidents could arise. Elsewhere, across the county, there is
about a 50% chance of at least a dusting accumulating on valley
floors including in the city of Kingman.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Weather Advisory for snow means periods of snow will
cause primarily travel difficulties. Expect snow covered roads
and limited visibilities, and use caution while driving.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
