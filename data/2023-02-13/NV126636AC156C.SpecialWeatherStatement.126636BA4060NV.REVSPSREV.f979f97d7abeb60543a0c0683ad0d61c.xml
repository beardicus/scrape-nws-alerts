<description>...GUSTY WINDS THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH TUESDAY ALONG WITH SNOW
SHOWERS AND MUCH COLDER TEMPERATURES TONIGHT AND TUESDAY...
A very cold winter system will arrive tonight reminding us that
we are still in the middle of winter.
WINDS: West to northwest winds will increase this afternoon,
peaking overnight, then shifting out of the north Tuesday. Gusts
of 35-50 mph are expected region-wide, stronger in higher
elevations and wind prone locations. This will bring rough
conditions on area lakes, and potential ground and air travel
difficulties.
SNOW: Light snow showers will develop overnight into early
Tuesday, primarily for areas in the eastern Sierra near and south
of Highway 50. A secondary round of snow will develop Tuesday with
hit or miss snow showers possible throughout the region from late
morning through approximately sunset. While overall totals will
be light, it doesn`t take much to cause travel difficulties. Check
with CalTrans Quickmap or NDOT NVRoads for the latest on road
conditions.
COLD: After a relatively warm day today, Tuesday will be a harsh
shock to the system. High temperatures will remain in the 30s
Tuesday and Wednesday in even the warmest of valleys, with teens
and 20s in the mountains. Widespread teen and single digit lows
can be expected, with colder valleys dipping below zero. To add
insult to injury, the addition of wind will make it feel even
colder, especially Monday night through Tuesday night. Wind chill
values will easily be in the single digit to below zero range at
times. It will be downright dangerous in exposed areas of the high
Sierra Tuesday night with wind chills of -20 to -30 degrees.
Bundle up tonight through Wednesday and be sure to protect
vulnerable populations as well as pets. Allow extra time for
travel on Tuesday.</description>
