<headline>Wind Advisory issued February 13 at 9:26PM PST until February 14 at 6:00AM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>...WIND ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM PST TUESDAY...
...FREEZE WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH
WEDNESDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...For the Wind Advisory, northwest winds 25 to 35 mph with
gusts up to 55 mph. For the Freeze Watch, sub-freezing
temperatures as low as 32 possible.
* WHERE...San Francisco, Marin Coastal Range, Coastal North Bay,
Including Point Reyes National Seashore and San Francisco
Peninsula Coast.
* WHEN...For the Wind Advisory, until 6 AM PST Tuesday. For the
Freeze Watch, from late Tuesday night through Wednesday
morning.
* IMPACTS...Gusty winds could blow around unsecured objects.
Tree limbs could be blown down and a few power outages may
result. Frost and freeze conditions could kill crops, other
sensitive vegetation and possibly damage unprotected outdoor
plumbing. Cold temperatures will impact unsheltered and
marginally sheltered populations.</description>
<instruction>Use extra caution when driving, especially if operating a high
profile vehicle. Secure outdoor objects.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
