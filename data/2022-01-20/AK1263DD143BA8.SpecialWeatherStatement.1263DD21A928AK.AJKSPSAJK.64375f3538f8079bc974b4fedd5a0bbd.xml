<description>...HEAVY RAIN POSSIBLE WITH RISING SNOW LEVELS LATE WEEK FOR THE
SOUTHERN PANHANDLE...
An atmospheric river will impact the central and northern
Panhandle this weekend, but could potentially drop south at times
across the southern Panhandle. Expect warming temperatures,
breezy conditions, rising snow levels, and the possibility of
heavy rain during some periods through this weekend. Rain may
become heavy briefly Thursday night before lifting north Friday.
Heavy rain could reappear Saturday night. The current forecast is
for rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches from Thursday evening
through Sunday, with the heaviest precipitation likely Saturday
night. Snow levels are forecast to rise from 3,000 in Misty
Fjords, to 6,000 feet around Ketchikan, to as much as 8,000 feet
on Prince of Wales Island. Rain along with a melting mountain
snowpack may increase the risk of minor flooding issues. Should
confidence increase in the possibility of flooding, a flood watch
could be issued in future.</description>
