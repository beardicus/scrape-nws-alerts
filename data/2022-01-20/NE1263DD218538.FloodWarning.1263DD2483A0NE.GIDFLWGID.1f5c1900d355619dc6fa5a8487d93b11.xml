<description>...FLOOD WARNING FOR AN ICE JAM NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM CST
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Minor flooding caused by an ice jam continues.
* WHERE...Along the Middle Loup River in parts of Sherman County,
particularly between the Loup City and Rockville areas.
* WHEN...Until 400 PM CST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding along low-lying pasture land immediately
adjacent to the river is expected. Also expect areas of slow
moving or standing water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 822 PM CST, Thursday, an automated gauge near Rockville
indicated an ice jam in the area, with the river level
fluctuating near the minor flood stage of 8.5 feet. Minor
flooding along the river in the Rockville area was also
confirmed by local emergency management.
- Because the short-term behavior of ice jams can be very
difficult to predict, those with interests along the Middle
Loup River should closely monitor water levels, as continued
fluctuations are likely. An extension-in-time of this Warning
is possible if the ice jam does not break up by late Friday
afternoon.
- Some locations that could experience flooding include...
locations immediately along the Middle Loup River in parts of
Sherman County.

enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service.</instruction>
