<headline>Flood Watch issued June 01 at 2:51PM MDT until further notice by NWS GrandJunction</headline>
<description>...The Flood Watch continues for the following rivers in Colorado...
Plateau Creek near Cameo affecting Grand and Battlement Mesas and
Debeque to Silt Corridor.
.Warm temperatures and chance for rain on snow will continue to melt
snowpack and increase river flows. In addition, Vega Reservoir has
reached full capacity, utilizing the overflow spillway, which will
maintain high flows down Plateau Creek.</description>
<instruction>If you are in the watch area, remain alert to possible flooding.
Residents and those recreating along or near the creek should
monitor rising water levels and be prepared for possible flood
warnings.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.
