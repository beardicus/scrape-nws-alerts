* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 512 AM AKDT, Heavy rain that fell over the Upper Chena
River Monday through early Wednesday is causing high water
and minor flooding on the Upper Chena River. The river gauge
at the the Mile 38 Bridge on Chena Hot Springs Road is at
20.45 feet and rising slowly. It is expected that the river
will crest at the Mile 38 bridge later this morning and cause
minor flooding of low lying areas of the Chena Rec Area. This
crest of high water and minor flooding will move downstream
to the Hunts Creek area this afternoon, and to the Moose
Creek Dam late tonight or early Friday.
- Parking areas, low lying roads, and boat ramps will be
flooded. Gravel bars will be under water. Logs and debris
will float down the river.
-   - For Chena River near Two Rivers:
At 5:00am the stage was 20.45 feet.
