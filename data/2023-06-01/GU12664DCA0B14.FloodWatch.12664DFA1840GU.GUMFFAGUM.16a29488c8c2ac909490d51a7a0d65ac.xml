<headline>Flood Watch issued June 01 at 3:09PM ChST  by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE SUNDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Guam.
* WHEN...Through late Sunday night.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Storm drains
and ditches may become clogged with debris.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Although heavy rain is not an currently imminent, a period of
moderate intensity rainfall is possible after midnight
tonight. Soil conditions are already saturated, which will
allow for runoff to easily commence. The  best potential for
heavy rainfall will be in the late Saturday night through
Monday morning time frame when flash flooding potential would
be higher, but again given the soil conditions, any period of
moderate rainfall lasting an hour or two would likely lead to
some flooding concerns beforehand.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action
should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.</instruction>
