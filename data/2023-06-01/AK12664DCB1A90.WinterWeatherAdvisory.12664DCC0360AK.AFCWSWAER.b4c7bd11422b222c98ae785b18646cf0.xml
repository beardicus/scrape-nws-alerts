<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued June 01 at 4:04AM AKDT until June 01 at 10:00AM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM AKDT
THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Rain transitioning to snow before sunrise. Snow
accumulations around 1 to 2 inches.
* WHERE...Copper River Basin, mainly through the higher
elevations of the Richardson, Glenn, and Tok Cutoff Highways.
* WHEN...Through 10 AM AKDT this morning.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Rain will mix with, and turn to, snow this
morning as temperatures continue to fall. Amounts of 1 to 2
inches of snow are expected, specifically along the Glenn
Highway from east of Eureka to just west of Glennallen.
Additional accumulations of 1 to 2 inches are possible along the
Richardson Hwy from Glennallen northward along the Richardson
Highway to Paxson into Isabel Pass, as well as along the Tok
Cutoff Highway to Mentasta Lake. Due to the temperatures being
just cold enough for snow, snow accumulations could be either
more than expected or stay mostly rain in some lower elevation
regions of the Copper River Basin.</description>
