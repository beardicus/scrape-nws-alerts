<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 26 at 3:32PM CST until December 27 at 6:00AM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Round of Wintry Precipitation Expected Tonight...
.Snow will break out across the area and begin to accumulate this
evening, especially along and north of Interstate 90 in parts of
Minnesota and Wisconsin. As the snow begins to shift north and
east later this evening, the precipitation could transition into
freezing drizzle leading to some light icing. Winds will also be
on the increase and could lead to drifting snow.
This combination of wintry precipitation will lead to some travel
impacts, including snow covered roads and slippery stretches. If
you are traveling at the end of the holiday weekend, be alert for
this weather and expect some impacts.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM CST
MONDAY...

evening hours, mixing with freezing drizzle from west to east
before midnight.
