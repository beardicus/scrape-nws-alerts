<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 26 at 4:01PM PST until December 27 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...SNOW SHOWERS AND MUCH COLDER TEMPERATURES EXPECTED THROUGH
EARLY MONDAY MORNING...
.A much colder airmass moving southward from interior Canada
will combine with the continued widespread snow showers to bring
accumulating snow to all of western Oregon and southwest
Washington. This will include elevations all the way to the valley
floors and to sea level on the coast. Today`s melted snow at lower
elevations will likely freeze on roads by evening to create
hazardous travel conditions. Snow will gradually decrease in
coverage and intensity late tonight into Monday morning.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM PST
MONDAY...
* WHAT...Periods of snow. Additional snow accumulations of up to
two inches under heavier showers. Winds gusting as high as 30
mph.
* WHERE...Central Oregon Coast.
* WHEN...Until 4 AM PST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Expect slippery road conditions with snow and ice
covered roads in many areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snowfall amounts could greatly vary
spatially due to the showery nature of the snow.</description>
