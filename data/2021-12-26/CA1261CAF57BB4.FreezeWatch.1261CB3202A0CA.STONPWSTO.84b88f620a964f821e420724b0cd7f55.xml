<description>...Several Very Cold Nights Ahead for Interior Northern
California...
...Gusty Winds through Late Tonight in the Northern Sacramento
Valley...
.A cold weather pattern is forecast to bring several very cold
nights and early mornings to interior Northern California this
week. Low temperatures are forecast to drop below freezing in
urban areas and plummet into the 20s in rural areas including the
lower foothills.
Although this stretch of cold weather is expected to result in
low temperatures from 5 to 12 degrees below normal, widespread
record low temperatures are not expected.
Gusty south winds will continue in the northern Sacramento Valley
through late tonight.
...WIND ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT PST TONIGHT...
...FREEZE WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY EVENING THROUGH
TUESDAY MORNING...
...FREEZE WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH
THURSDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...For the Wind Advisory, south winds 15 to 25 mph with
gusts up to 40 mph. For the first Freeze Watch, sub-freezing
temperatures in the mid to upper 20s possible.
* WHERE...Northern Sacramento Valley, Central Sacramento Valley
and Northeast Foothills/Sacramento Valley Counties.
* WHEN...For the Wind Advisory, until midnight PST tonight. Below
freezing low temperatures are expected to occur Tuesday through
Thursday mornings.
* IMPACTS...Gusty winds could blow around unsecured objects. Tree
limbs could be blown down and a few power outages may result.
Frost and freeze conditions could kill crops, other sensitive
vegetation and possibly damage unprotected outdoor plumbing.</description>
<instruction>Use extra caution when driving, especially if operating a high
profile vehicle. Secure outdoor objects.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
