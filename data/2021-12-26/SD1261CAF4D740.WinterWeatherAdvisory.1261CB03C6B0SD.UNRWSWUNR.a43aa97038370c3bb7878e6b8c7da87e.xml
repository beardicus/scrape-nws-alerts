<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 26 at 10:12AM MST until December 27 at 8:00AM MST by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>.A clipper system will bring another inch or two of snow to far
northwest SD this evening. Winds will shift northwest this
evening and remain gusty into Monday morning, with gusts to around
50 mph possible. This will lead to blowing and drifting snow in
areas that have snow on the ground. In addition, the strong winds
and bitterly cold temperatures below zero will allow wind chill
readings of 25 to 35 below zero, late tonight into Monday morning.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 5 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO
8 AM MST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of up to two
inches. Winds gusting as high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...Harding County and Perkins County.
* WHEN...From 5 PM this afternoon to 8 AM MST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The dangerously
cold wind chills as low as 35 below zero could cause frostbite
on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
Road conditions are available on your smartphone from the
5 1 1 app for your state.</instruction>
