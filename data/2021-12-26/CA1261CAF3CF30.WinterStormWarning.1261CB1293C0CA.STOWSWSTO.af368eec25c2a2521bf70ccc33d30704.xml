<description>...Multiple Winter Storms to Impact Mountain and Foothill Travel
through Early This Week...
.Unsettled weather will continue into early this week with
additional mountain snow and gusty winds. We will see another
round of heavy snow later this afternoon into Monday with snow
showers lingering into Monday night. Snow levels will generally be
between 1500 and 2500 feet lowering Monday afternoon into the
evening down to 1000 feet, locally lower over Shasta County and
down to a few 100 feet Monday night.
Major travel delays and difficult to impossible travel conditions
are anticipated through early this week. Gusty winds will further
reduce visibilities during this event with local whiteout
conditions possible. Holiday travelers should prepare for winter
driving conditions by packing chains, warm winter clothes, and
extra food and water. Foothill locations that do not normally
receive snow should prepare for wintry conditions.

impossible. Tree branches could fall as well. Additional snow
accumulations in the Sierra of 3 to 5 feet, with localized
amounts up to 8 feet, are expected above 3000 feet, 6 to 18
inches between 2000 and 3000 feet with localized amounts up to
3 feet, and less than 6 inches below 2000 feet. Additional snow
accumulation for the Coastal Range and Shasta County of less
than 2 inches below 1500 feet, 4 to 12 inches above 1500 feet,
with localized amounts up to 2 feet, are expected.

Northern Sierra Nevada including Interstate 80 over Donner Pass,

roads and limited visibilities. Travel is not recommended while
the warning is in effect. If you must travel, keep an extra
flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case of an
emergency.The latest road conditions for the state you are
