<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued December 26 at 4:01PM PST until December 27 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...SNOW SHOWERS AND MUCH COLDER TEMPERATURES EXPECTED THROUGH
EARLY MONDAY MORNING...
.A much colder airmass moving southward from interior Canada
will combine with the continued widespread snow showers to bring
accumulating snow to all of western Oregon and southwest
Washington. This will include elevations all the way to the valley
floors and to sea level on the coast. Today`s melted snow at lower
elevations will likely freeze on roads by evening to create
hazardous travel conditions. Snow will gradually decrease in
coverage and intensity late tonight into Monday morning.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM PST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Periods of heavy snow. Additional snow accumulations of
2 to 4 inches under heavier showers.
* WHERE...In Washington, Western Columbia River Gorge and
Central Columbia River Gorge. In Oregon, Western Columbia
River Gorge and Central Columbia River Gorge.
* WHEN...Until 4 AM PST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Expect winter driving conditions with snow and ice
covered roads, and reduced visibility. Travel could be very
difficult.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
