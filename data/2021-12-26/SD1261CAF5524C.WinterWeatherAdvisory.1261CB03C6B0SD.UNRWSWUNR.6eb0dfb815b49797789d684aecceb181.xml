<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 26 at 1:27PM MST until December 27 at 8:00AM MST by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>.A clipper system will bring another inch or two of snow to
northwest SD this evening. Winds will shift northwest this evening
and remain gusty into Monday morning, with gusts to around 50 mph
possible. This will lead to blowing and drifting snow in areas
that have snow on the ground. In addition, the strong winds and
bitterly cold temperatures below zero will allow wind chill
readings of 25 to 35 below zero, late tonight into Monday
morning.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 5 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO
8 AM MST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of up to two
inches. Winds gusting as high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...Butte County, the Northern Meade County Plains and
Ziebach County. This includes the Tribal Lands of the Cheyenne
River Reservation.
* WHEN...From 5 PM this afternoon to 8 AM MST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Patchy blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility. The cold wind chills as
low as 30 below zero could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as
little as 30 minutes.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
Road conditions are available on your smartphone from the
5 1 1 app for your state.</instruction>
