<description>...Round of Wintry Precipitation Expected Tonight...
.Snow will break out across the area and begin to accumulate this
evening, especially along and north of Interstate 90 in parts of
Minnesota and Wisconsin. As the snow begins to shift north and
east later this evening, the precipitation could transition into
freezing drizzle leading to some light icing. Winds will also be
on the increase and could lead to drifting snow.
This combination of wintry precipitation will lead to some travel
impacts, including snow covered roads and slippery stretches. If
you are traveling at the end of the holiday weekend, be alert for
this weather and expect some impacts.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM THIS
EVENING TO 9 AM CST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow accumulations
of 2 to 4 inches and ice accumulations of up to one tenth of
an inch. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Taylor, Clark, Juneau and Adams Counties.
* WHEN...Snow overspreads the area around or shortly after 9 pm
and gradually transitions to freezing drizzle after midnight.
The freezing drizzle comes to an end shortly after sunrise on
Monday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning commute.</description>
