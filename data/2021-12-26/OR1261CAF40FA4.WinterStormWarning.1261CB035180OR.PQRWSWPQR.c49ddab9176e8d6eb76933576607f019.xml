<description>...ACCUMULATING SNOW AND MUCH COLDER TEMPERATURES EXPECTED
THROUGH EARLY MONDAY MORNING...

accumulating snow to all of western Oregon and southwest
Washington. This will include elevations all the way to the
valley floors and to sea level on the coast. Snow will gradually
decrease in coverage and intensity late tonight and Monday.

* WHAT...Heavy snow. Additional snow accumulations of 8 to 15
inches. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...Northern Oregon Cascades and Cascades in Lane County.
* WHEN...Until 4 AM PST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Expect severe winter driving conditions with snow and
ice covered roads, and reduced visibility. Travel could be very
difficult.</description>
<instruction>Anyone with travel plans should stay aware of the latest weather
information, have alternative travel plans, or delay travel if
possible.
If you must travel, be prepared for winter driving conditions
with snow and ice covered roads. If you must travel, slow down,
and allow plenty of extra time to reach your destination. Allow
extra following distance to the vehicle in front of you, and keep
snow chains and a winter survival kit, including a flashlight,
food, and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency.
