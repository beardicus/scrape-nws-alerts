times. Wind gusts could lead to some patchy blowing snow.
Farther south, snowfall amounts are expected in the 2 to 4 inch
range. The snow will mix with or change to freezing drizzle across
most of the area late tonight. Ice accumulation of less than a
tenth of an inch can be expected.

inches. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.
