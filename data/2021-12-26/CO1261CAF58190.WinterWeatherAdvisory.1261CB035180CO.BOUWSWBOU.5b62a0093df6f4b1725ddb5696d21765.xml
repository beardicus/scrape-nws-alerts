<description>...HEAVY SNOW AND STRONG WINDS MOVING ACROSS THE NORTHERN COLORADO
MOUNTAINS...
.A cold front moving across the mountains was bringing strong winds
and considerable blowing snow along with a quick shot of heavy snow
across the northern Colorado mountains this afternoon. There will be
near blizzard conditions at times and road closures will be
possible. The worst of the snow and winds will be past by this
evening, though lighter snow and windy conditions will continue over
the higher mountains overnight.
Snow will decrease by late afternoon or early evening, but slick
roads, lighter snow, and areas of blowing snow will continue through
Sunday night.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 AM MST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Snow and blowing snow expected. Total snow accumulations of
4 to 8 inches. Wind gusts of 40 to 55 mph will be common, with
gusts in excess of 70 mph above timberline.
* WHERE...Rocky Mountain National Park and the Medicine Bow Range,
and The Mountains of Summit County, the Mosquito Range, and the
Indian Peaks.
* WHEN...The worst conditions will be this afternoon, with gradual
improvement overnight.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult, with intermittent road
closures possible. Widespread blowing snow could significantly
reduce visibility with near blizzard conditions at times,
especially this afternoon.</description>
<instruction>Consider delaying travel until the worst conditions have passed
later this evening, or tomorrow morning if possible. If you do
travel, carry extra food, water and fuel along with warm clothing.
Be prepared for slow travel and possible road closures. The latest
road conditions and closure information for Colorado can be obtained
