to the mountains on Sunday. Snow will increase this morning, and
will be heavy at times especially during the middle of the day.
Strong winds and considerable blowing snow will combine with the
falling snow to produce near blizzard conditions at times. Road
closures will be possible.
Snow will decrease by late afternoon or early evening, but slick
roads, lighter snow, and areas of blowing snow will continue through
Sunday night.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 AM MST MONDAY...

8 inches. Wind gusts of 40 to 55 mph will be common, with gusts in

* WHERE...Rocky Mountain National Park and the Medicine Bow Range,
and The Mountains of Summit County, the Mosquito Range, and the
Indian Peaks.
* WHEN...Until 5 AM MST Monday.

closures possible. Widespread blowing snow could significantly
reduce visibility with near blizzard conditions at times,
especially this afternoon.</description>
