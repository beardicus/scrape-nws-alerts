<description>...MISSOURI RIVER NEAR BISMARCK AND MANDAN ICING OVER...
The Bismarck and Mandan reach of the Missouri River is now seeing
sheets of ice form. These sheets of ice have thus far continued to
pass through the tight meanders near the University of Mary, but
will most likely begin to restrict the river`s flow as they
accumulate. As the river channel fills with immobile ice, the river
above the immobile ice will see rapid increases in water levels.
Since 2010, the river has risen between five and nearly eight feet
during the first icing over event for the winter season, often in
well under 24 hours. As of Wednesday afternoon, the water level for
the Missouri River at Bismarck is 4.1 feet. Given recent history,
this would suggest the river will be at a stage of between roughly 9
feet and 12 feet sometime between late Wednesday evening and late
Friday afternoon. Flood stage at the Bismarck gage on the Missouri
River is 14.5 feet.
If you observe problematic high water, please report this to your
local emergency management.</description>
