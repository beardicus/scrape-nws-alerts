<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued November 30 at 2:11PM PST until December 02 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM THURSDAY TO
4 AM PST FRIDAY...
* CHANGES...Earlier start time of advisory. Slight increase in
snow totals below 5000 feet.
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulation 1 to 4 inches
except 3 to 7 inches in foothill locations near and above 5000
feet including Virginia City. Wind gusts up to 50 mph in the
early afternoon, then diminishing during the evening.
* WHERE...Greater Reno-Carson City-Minden Area.
* WHEN...From 1 PM Thursday to 4 AM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the Thursday evening and the Friday
morning commutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow may begin to accumulate during the day
Thursday in foothill locations, but the greatest risk for snow
accumulations at all elevations will occur Thursday afternoon
through the evening commute. Even though the snow is expected to
wrap up before the Friday morning commute, the roads may still
be slick and hazardous.</description>
<instruction>Even light snowfall causes major travel delays, especially during
periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to
reach your destination. Leave extra space between vehicles since
it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
