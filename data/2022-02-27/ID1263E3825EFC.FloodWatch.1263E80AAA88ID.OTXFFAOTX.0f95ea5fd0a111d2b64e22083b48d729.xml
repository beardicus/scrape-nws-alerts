<headline>Flood Watch issued February 27 at 8:43PM MST until March 04 at 12:54AM MST by NWS Spokane</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Spokane WA has issued a Flood
Watch for the following rivers in Idaho...
St Joe River at St Maries affecting Benewah County.
...The Flood Watch continues for the following rivers in Idaho...
Coeur d Alene River at Cataldo affecting Kootenai and Shoshone
Counties.
.A warm, windy, and wet storm system will impact the region over the
next 24-36 hours.  Heavy rain will fall Monday into Tuesday.
Temperatures will warm above freezing and remain mild into Wednesday
increasing snowmelt.  The combination of heavy rain and snowmelt
will result in excess runoff and potential for rivers to rise
quickly, some which could reach minor flood stage this week.
For the St. Joe River...including St Maries...flooding is possible.
...FLOOD WATCH NOW IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY AFTERNOON TO LATE THURSDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding is possible.
* WHERE...Coeur d Alene River at Cataldo.
* WHEN...From Tuesday afternoon to late Thursday evening.
* IMPACTS...At 43.0 feet, Minor flooding of farmland from Cataldo
downstream to Harrison is likely. The campground at Cataldo will
also begin to flood. Portions of Dudley Road, west of Latour
Creek, will likely be underwater and impassable. If there is
significant water already in the floodplain, these impacts may
occur at lower stages. Old Coeur d`Alene River Road on the North
Fork of the Coeur d`Alene River may begin to flood north of the
Bumblebee Bridge.
At 44.0 feet, Homes near the river may experience some flooding of
basements. Water will begin to cover CCC Road near the Mennonite
Church. Some water will be over the section of Latour Creek Road
immediately south of Interstate 90, near the campground. Due to
the high water table some homes behind the Cataldo levee will be
surrounded by water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 6:30 PM PST Sunday the stage was 33.5 feet.
- Forecast...Flood stage may be reached early Tuesday
afternoon.
