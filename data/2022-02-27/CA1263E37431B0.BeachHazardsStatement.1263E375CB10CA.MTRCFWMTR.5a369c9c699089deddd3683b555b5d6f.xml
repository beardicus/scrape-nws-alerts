<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued February 27 at 2:52AM PST until February 27 at 1:00PM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>...Sneaker Wave Risk at Area Beaches this Weekend...
.Long period northwest swell originating from a storm system near
the Aleutians continues along our coastline, creating a high risk
of sneaker waves at area beaches. Sneaker wave risk remains high
as swell heights and wave periods remain elevated. In addition,
stronger than usual rip currents should be expected.
On days with high sneaker wave risk, the ocean can appear
deceptively calm with long lulls between larger wave sets. This
may lead to individuals venturing onto exposed coastal features
where infrequent but powerful waves can overwhelm them, knocking
them into the cold, restless ocean where the possibility of
hypothermia or drowning is severe. Each year, individuals lose
their life during similar sneaker wave events along the
California coast. If visiting the coast this weekend, respect the
power of the ocean, remain vigilant of your surroundings, and
avoiding venturing onto exposed coastal features where sudden,
powerful waves can put your life at risk.
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM PST THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Long period northwest swell at 17 to 20 seconds.
* WHERE...Coastal North Bay Including Point Reyes National
Seashore, Southern Monterey Bay and Big Sur Coast, San
Francisco Peninsula Coast, San Francisco and Northern Monterey
Bay.
* WHEN...Until 1 pm PST this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...High risk of sneaker waves and strong rip currents.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The high risk of sneaker waves continues
through this morning with wave heights 5 to 8 feet and periods
of 17 to 20 seconds. The risk of sneaker wave decreases by this
afternoon as wave heights increase enough for the ocean to
provide its own natural warning.</description>
