rivers are likely to experience high flows with potential for minor
flooding.

* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of North Idaho, including the following
counties, Benewah, Bonner, Boundary, Kootenai, Latah and Shoshone.
* WHEN...From Monday morning through Wednesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- An atmospheric river arrives on Monday bringing periods of
moderate to heavy rainfall along with warm, windy conditions.
Temperatures will warm above freezing Sunday night into
Monday and remain mild through
Wednesday.  Low elevation snow is expected to melt off
quickly.
On top of the snowmelt, one to three inches of rain will be
possible.  The combination of heavy rainfall and snowmelt
will lead to rapid runoff and potential for minor flooding
issues.

<instruction>If possible, clear snow and ice away from drains in urban areas.
Create channels in ice and snow to allow water to drain away from
homes and buildings if located in a low-lying spot. Continue to
monitor later forecasts to stay up to date. Report flooding to
local law enforcement and the National Weather Service.</instruction>
