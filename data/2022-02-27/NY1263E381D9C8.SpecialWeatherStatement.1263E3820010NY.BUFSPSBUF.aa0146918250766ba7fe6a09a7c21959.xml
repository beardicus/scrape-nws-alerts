<description>...AN AREA OF HEAVY SNOW and LOW VISIBILITIES WILL AFFECT
PORTIONS OF LEWIS COUNTY...
At 701 PM EST, an area of heavy snow was located along a line
extending from near Barnes Corners to near Nicks Lake Campground.
Movement was south at 15 mph.
Locations impacted include...
Lowville, Highmarket, Barnes Corners, Whetstone Gulf State Park,
Denmark, New Bremen, Watson, Martinsburg, Lyonsdale, Greig,
Copenhagen, Port Leyden, Croghan, Lyons Falls, Castorland,
Constableville, Turin, Bellwood, Rector and Mohawk Hill.
The snow can accumulate at a rate of one inch per hour or more in
this area of heavy snow. Be prepared for hazardous driving
conditions. Consider delaying travel if you will be going through
this area of heavy snow.
Visibilities are below one quarter of a mile in this area of heavy
snow. If you are driving, slow down and be on alert for other
motorists. Low visibility shortens the amount of time you have to
react to situations.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time when traveling.</description>
