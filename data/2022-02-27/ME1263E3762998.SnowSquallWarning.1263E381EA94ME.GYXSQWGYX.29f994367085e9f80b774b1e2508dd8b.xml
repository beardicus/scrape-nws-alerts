PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Travel is not advised during this dangerous snow squall.  Rapid
visibility reduction and potentially icy roads are likely to lead to
accidents.  Consider delaying travel until the squall passes your
location.  If traveling, pull off to a safe location and turn your
headlights on.
Temperatures are above freezing, but sharply colder temperatures
following the snow will cause any water or slush to quickly freeze on
roads and sidewalks.  Untreated road surfaces will become extremely
slippery.  Reduced speeds and increased distance between vechicles is
advised.</description>
