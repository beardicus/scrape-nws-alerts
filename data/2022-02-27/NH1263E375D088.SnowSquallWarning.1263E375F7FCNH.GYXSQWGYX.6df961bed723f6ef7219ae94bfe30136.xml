* At 412 PM EST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from 28 miles north of Jackman to 18 miles northeast of

30 mph.
HAZARD...Whiteout conditions. Zero visibility in snow and wind
gusts up to 40 mph.

IMPACT...Dangerous life-threatening travel.
This includes Interstate 93 between mile markers 95 and 131.

Eustis, Coburn Gore, Rangeley, Haverhill, Franconia, Andover, Errol,
Dixville, Stratford, Pittsburg, Woodstock, Seboomook and Grafton.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Travel is not advised during this dangerous snow squall.  Rapid
visibility reduction and potentially icy roads are likely to lead to
accidents.  Consider delaying travel until the squall passes your
location.  If traveling, pull off to a safe location and turn your
headlights on.
Road temperatures are above freezing, but sharply colder
temperatures following the snow will cause any water or slush to
quickly freeze on roads and sidewalks.  Untreated road surfaces will
become extremely slippery.  Reduced speeds and increased distance
between vechicles is advised.</description>
