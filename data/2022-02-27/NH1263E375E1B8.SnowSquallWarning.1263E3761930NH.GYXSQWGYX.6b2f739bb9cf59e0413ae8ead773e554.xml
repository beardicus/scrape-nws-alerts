<headline>Snow Squall Warning issued February 27 at 4:58PM EST until February 27 at 6:00PM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Gray Maine has issued a
* Snow Squall Warning for...
Northern Sullivan County in central New Hampshire...
Southern Grafton County in northern New Hampshire...
* Until 600 PM EST.
* At 456 PM EST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from 8 miles southwest of Franconia to 34 miles west of
Hanover, moving southeast at 25 mph.
HAZARD...Whiteout conditions. Zero visibility in snow and wind
gusts up to 40 mph.
SOURCE...Radar and webcams.
IMPACT...Dangerous life-threatening travel.
This includes the following highways...
Interstate 89 between mile markers 37 and 60.
Interstate 93 between mile markers 75 and 95.
Locations impacted include...
Claremont, Lebanon, Plymouth, New London, Grafton, Hanover,
Charlestown, Haverhill, Enfield, Canaan, Holderness, Ashland,
Danbury, Groton, Newport, Piermont, Woodstock, Sandwich, Bristol and
Grantham.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Travel is not advised during this dangerous snow squall.  Rapid
visibility reduction and potentially icy roads are likely to lead to
accidents.  Consider delaying travel until the squall passes your
location.  If traveling, pull off to a safe location and turn your
headlights on.
Temperatures are above freezing, but sharply colder temperatures
following the snow will cause any water or slush to quickly freeze on
roads and sidewalks.  Untreated road surfaces will become extremely
slippery.  Reduced speeds and increased distance between vechicles is
advised.</description>
