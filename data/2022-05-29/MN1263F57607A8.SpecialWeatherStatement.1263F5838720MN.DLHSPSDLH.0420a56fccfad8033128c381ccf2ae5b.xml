<description>...STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS MAY AFFECT THE BOUNDARY WATERS
CANOE AREA WILDERNESS MONDAY INTO MONDAY NIGHT...
A few strong thunderstorms will be possible through tonight with
hail and strong gusts possible. However, a better chance for strong
to severe thunderstorms are possible in the Boundary Waters Canoe
Area Wilderness Monday afternoon into Monday night. The storms
will be capable of erratic and gusty winds in excess of 65 mph,
large hail, frequent cloud- to- ground lightning, and heavy
rainfall, which may lead to localized flooding of creeks, streams,
and low- lying areas.
Campers should take extra precautions in order to secure
campsites and make a plan in case of severe weather. Check
campsites for possible hazards, including standing dead trees or
limbs, as well as low spots where water can pool. Move tents away
from creeks and rivers in case of flash flooding. Prepare to
protect yourself from large hail using sleeping bags or other
padded items. Monitor NOAA Weather Radio for updates and possible
warnings.</description>
