<description>...AIR QUALITY HEALTH ADVISORY FOR WILDFIRE SMOKE FROM 900 AM
SUNDAY UNTIL 900 AM MONDAY...
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has
issued the following...
WHAT...Air Quality Health Advisory for Wildfire Smoke.
WHERE...southern Conejos County. Locations include, but are not
limited to, Fox Creek.
WHEN...900 AM Sunday May 29 to 900 AM Monday May 30
IMPACTS...Moderate to heavy smoke is expected in close vicinity to
the Menkhaven wildfire located along Highway 17 in Conejos County
approximately 6 miles northwest of Fox Creek. Winds will mainly
come from the southwest on Sunday. Thunderstorms are also possible
on Sunday afternoon. These may produce gusty, erratic winds that
can send smoke in any direction. The greatest impacts from smoke
are expected in areas in the immediate vicinity of the fire
throughout the day, and during overnight hours Sunday night smoke
may begin to drain down the Conejos River, possibly bring periods
of heavy smoke to Fox Creek early Monday morning.
HEALTH INFORMATION...Public Health Recommendations: If smoke is
thick or becomes thick in your neighborhood you may want to remain
indoors. This is especially true for those with heart disease,
respiratory illnesses, the very young, and the elderly. Consider
limiting outdoor activity when moderate to heavy smoke is present.
Consider relocating temporarily if smoke is present indoors and is
making you ill. If visibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in
your neighborhood, smoke has reached levels that are unhealthy.</description>
