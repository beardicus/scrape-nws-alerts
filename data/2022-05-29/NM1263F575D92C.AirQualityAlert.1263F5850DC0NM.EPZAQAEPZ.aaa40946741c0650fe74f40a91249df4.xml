<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM MDT MONDAY...
The New Mexico Departments of Health and Environment has issued an
Air Quality Alert, until 1 PM MDT Monday.
An Air Quality Alert for Smoke has been issued.
* WHAT... Smoke from the Black fire in the Gila National Forest,
which has grown nearly 50 thousand acres in the past three days,
will continue to have the greatest air quality impacts in the
region as it gets transported east-northeast. Smoke from the
Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon fire will originate from active fire that
is mostly located at higher elevations along the western perimeter
with more isolated impacts for lower elevation communities along
the east slopes of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Overall, haze
will persist away from the larger fires for many areas and areas of
blowing dust will, at times, contribute to diminished air quality
for lower elevations through the evening.
* WHERE... Surface smoke impacts will be greatest for portions of
the Mimbres and Lower Rio Grande valleys in southwest New Mexico
and the Mora and Sapello River valleys along the east slopes of the
Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Elsewhere, layered smoke aloft will be
most noticeable in the vicinity of Abo Pass, Carrizozo, Corona,
Elephant Butte, Gran Quivira, Mountainair, Socorro, Truth or
Consequences, and Vaughn. Light to moderate smoke may settle into
portions of the Upper Tularosa Basin and the Highway 380 corridor
between San Antonio and Bingham tonight. More details on impacted
locations and latest air quality information can be found at
https://fire.airnow.gov
* WHEN... Remainder of this afternoon through 1pm MDT Monday, May
30.</description>
