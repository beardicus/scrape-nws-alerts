<description>...Runoff has begun, with significant rises on area streams...
Warmer temperatures last week increased mountain snowmelt, resulting
in significant rises on area streams. The addition of significant
precipitation through Tuesday will add more runoff to these
waterways.  While flooding is not anticipated on larger rivers and
streams, there is a chance that some smaller streams and creeks
could reach bankfull in the foothills, producing localized flooding.
Any flooding will depend on how heavy the precipitation is that
falls on that stream basin. At the very least stream flows will be
much higher with the increased snowmelt and precipitation generated
runoff.
For those living near waterways, be prepared for higher water levels.
Move any livestock and equipment to higher ground away from
waterways. For those planning recreation activities on or near
waterways, be prepared for changing conditions and significantly
higher flows. Fast flowing muddy water can conceal hazards making
floating dangerous until runoff abates.
Erosion will also increase as stream flows increase, making stream
banks unstable. Be sure to stay well away from the edge as undercut
stream banks can give way suddenly. Do not allow children to play
near the edge of fast flowing streams. Every year children are
accidentally swept away during runoff season, don`t let it happen to
your children.
Stay tuned to the forecast. Please report any flooding to local law
enforcement and have them relay the report to the National Weather
Service.</description>
