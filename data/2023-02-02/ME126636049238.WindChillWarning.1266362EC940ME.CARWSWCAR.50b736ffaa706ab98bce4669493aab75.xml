<headline>Wind Chill Warning issued February 02 at 6:34PM EST until February 04 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Caribou</headline>
<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM FRIDAY TO 7 PM EST
SATURDAY...
...WIND CHILL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM FRIDAY TO 7 PM EST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Blizzard Warning, ground blizzard conditions
expected. Total snow accumulations up to one inch. Winds gusting
as high as 50 mph. For the Wind Chill Warning, dangerously cold
wind chills expected. Wind chills as low as 60 below zero.
* WHERE...Northeast Aroostook and Northwest Aroostook Counties.
* WHEN...For the Blizzard Warning, from 1 AM Friday to 7 PM EST
Saturday. For the Wind Chill Warning, from 4 AM Friday to 7 PM EST
Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the Friday morning and evening commutes.
Isolated to scattered power outages are possible. The dangerously
cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as
little as 5 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...In addition to low wind chills, areas of
blowing snow could cause whiteout conditions, particularly across
open areas exposed to northwest winds. Blowing and drifting snow
could make travel very difficult. If you must travel have a winter
survival kit and if you get stranded, stay in your vehicle.</description>
<instruction>A Wind Chill Warning means the combination of very cold air and the
wind will create dangerously low wind chill values. Frostbite can
occur quickly and even hypothermia or death if precautions are not
taken.
Persons should consider delaying all travel. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution. Consider taking a winter
storm kit along with you, including such items as tire chains,
booster cables, flashlight, shovel, blankets and extra clothing.
Also take water, a first aid kit, and anything else that would help
you survive in case you become stranded.
Keep pets indoors as much as possible.</instruction>
