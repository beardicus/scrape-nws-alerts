<headline>Wind Chill Warning issued February 02 at 10:34PM EST until February 05 at 1:00AM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...DANGEROUSLY COLD WIND CHILLS EXPECTED FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...
.An arctic cold front will cross the region tonight and drive
temperatures below zero through the day Friday. In fact the high
temperature for Friday will likely occur in the coming few hours,
with continuous temperature falls through Friday night. Temperatures
will not begin to rise again until after sunrise Saturday morning.
The bitter cold combined with gusty winds will lead to widespread,
dangerously cold wind chills beginning imminently in the mountains
and into the morning to the south. The wind chills have the
potentially to be once in a generation cold late Friday into early
Saturday.
...WIND CHILL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM EST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Dangerously cold wind chills expected. Wind chills as low
as 50 below zero.
* WHERE...Portions of west central and western Maine. Portions of
northern New Hampshire.
* WHEN...Until 1 AM EST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Frostbite and hypothermia are possible if precautions
are not taken. Exposed skin may become quickly frostbitten or
frozen in as little as 10 minutes. Wind chill values may fall to
life threatening levels.</description>
<instruction>Persons are urged to stay indoors until conditions improve. If you
must go outside, dress in layers. Several layers of clothes will
keep you warmer than a single heavy coat. Cover exposed skin to
reduce your risk of frostbite or hypothermia. Gloves, a scarf, and a
hat will keep you from losing your body heat.
Keep pets indoors as much as possible.
If you must travel, dress for the outdoor conditions in case of car
trouble. Car troubles become more common in cold conditions.
Make frequent checks on older family, friends, and neighbors. Ensure
portable heaters are used correctly. Do not use generators or grills
inside.</instruction>
