<description>...Weak system expected tonight into Friday with a second,
stronger winter storm slated to arrive by Saturday evening...
* A weak system is expected to push through northeast California
tonight into Friday. Southwest winds will begin to increase this
evening with gusts along the ridges of 50 to 70 mph and 30 mph
or less in the lower elevations. Winds will begin to diminish
late Friday afternoon.
* Light snow showers will move into the Sierra on Friday. While
accumulations are expected to be minimal, we may see up to 2
inches above 5500 feet west of US-395. Keep in mind that even
light accumulations on the roadway can create slick and
hazardous conditions.
* A more potent winter storm is still expected to move into the
area Saturday evening through Sunday. This system will bring
more widespread wind and snow impacts. Total snowfall
accumulations of 1 to 5 inches will be possible above 5000 feet,
with 7 to 15 inches west of US-395. Stay tuned to forecast
updates as we head into the weekend. In the meantime, download
Caltran`s &quot;Quickmap&quot; application so you will have access to the
latest information on California roadway conditions.</description>
