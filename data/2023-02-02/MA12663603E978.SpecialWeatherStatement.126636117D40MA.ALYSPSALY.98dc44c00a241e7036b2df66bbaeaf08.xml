<description>...Snow squalls, gusty winds, and plummeting temperatures expected
late this evening into tonight...
A band of snow squalls is likely to produce a brief period of
whiteout conditions, gusty winds, and slick travel on untreated
roadways in portions of eastern New York and western New England
late this evening into tonight. This threat is highest over the
southern Adirondacks, Mohawk and Schoharie Valleys, southern
Greens, and eastern Catskills. Snow showers could produce a
dusting of snow and briefly lowered visibilities in the Saratoga-
Glens Falls Region to the Capital District as well.
The snow squalls and showers are most likely over the southern
Adirondacks 8-11 pm, Mohawk and Schoharie Valleys and Lake George
Saratoga Region 10 pm-1 am, and the Capital District, eastern
Catskills, and southern Vermont 12-3 am.
Temperatures will plummet with winds gusting to 30-45 miles per
hour behind the cold front tonight. Wind chills will be well below
zero by early Friday morning.</description>
