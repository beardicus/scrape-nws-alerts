<headline>Wind Chill Warning issued February 02 at 3:31AM EST until February 05 at 1:00AM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...DANGEROUSLY COLD WIND CHILLS EXPECTED FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...
.An arctic cold front will cross the region tonight and drive
temperatures below zero during the day Friday. In fact the high
temperature for Friday will likely occur just after midnight
Thursday night and temperatures will not rise again until Saturday
morning. The bitter cold combined with gusty winds will lead to
widespread dangerously cold wind chills beginning as early as
Thurday night in the mountains and Friday morning to the south. The
wind chills have the potentially to be once in a generation cold
late Friday into early Saturday.
...WIND CHILL WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM FRIDAY TO 1 AM EST
SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Dangerously cold wind chills expected. Wind chills as low
as 50 below zero.
* WHERE...Portions of west central and western Maine. Portions of
northern New Hampshire.
* WHEN...From 1 AM Friday to 1 AM EST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Frostbite and hypothermia are possible if precautions
are not taken. Exposed skin may become quickly frostbitten or
frozen in as little as 10 minutes. Wind chill values may fall to
life threatening levels.</description>
<instruction>Persons are urged to stay indoors until conditions improve. If you
must go outside, dress in layers. Several layers of clothes will
keep you warmer than a single heavy coat. Cover exposed skin to
reduce your risk of frostbite or hypothermia. Gloves, a scarf, and a
hat will keep you from losing your body heat.
Keep pets indoors as much as possible.
Make frequent checks on older family, friends, and neighbors. Ensure
portable heaters are used correctly. Do not use generators or grills
inside.</instruction>
