<description>...LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND GUSTY CONDITIONS POSSIBLE THROUGH
WEDNESDAY...
A circulation, JTWC Invest 93W, is now located west of the Marianas
near 15N144E. Heavy showers and a few thunderstorms extend from near
the center to the east of the Marianas within a generally southerly
flow. Overnight scatterometry data indicated stronger southeast winds
of around 25 mph across the far northern Mariana Islands. This
feature is being monitored by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center for
gradual development as it heads northwestward and away from the
Marianas the next several days.
Computer model guidance continues to show the potential for heavy
rainfall through Wednesday as a moist and unsettled southerly flow
remains in place over the Marianas. The higher potential appears to
be from Rota northward where 4 to 6 inches of rain are possible.
Additionally, winds are expected to increase to between 15 and 20 mph
tonight and Wednesday with gusts nearer heavy showers reaching close
to 30 mph.
Seas, currently between 3 and 5 feet, will become choppy at times in
response to the increasing winds and could increase to between 6 and
8 feet by Wednesday, especially across the northern islands.
Folks in the Marianas should keep up to date with the latest
statements and advisories from the National Weather Service and
your local emergency management offices. Forecast products issued
by the National Weather Service are posted on the WFO Guam web
page at www.weather.gov/gum.</description>
