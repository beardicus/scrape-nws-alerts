<description>...EXCESSIVE HEAT WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM PDT
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Dangerously hot conditions with temperatures in the 90s
and lows in the mid to upper 60s. This will pose a high risk of
heat-related illness.
Along with high temperatures this week, we are expecting high
levels of ozone pollution (smog) for the Cascade foothills of
King and Pierce counties from Issaquah to the east. North Bend
and Enumclaw will particularly be affected. Ozone levels are
expected to reach UNHEALTHY FOR SENSITIVE GROUPS in the
afternoon, on Tuesday through Friday (July 26-29).
* WHERE...East Puget Sound Lowlands.
* WHEN...Until 9 PM PDT Friday.
* IMPACTS...Extreme heat will significantly increase the risk of
heat-related illnesses for much of the population, especially
those who are heat sensitive and those without effective cooling
or adequate hydration.
Ozone can trigger a variety of health problems including chest
pain, coughing, throat irritation and congestion. It can also
worsen bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Ozone concentrations are expected to be
the highest in the afternoon and evening. We expect the ground-
level ozone pollution levels to come back down to healthy levels
as temperatures decline.</description>
<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.
