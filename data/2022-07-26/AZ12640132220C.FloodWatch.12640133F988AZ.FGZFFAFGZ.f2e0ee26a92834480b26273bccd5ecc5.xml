* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of north central Arizona and northeast Arizona,
including the following areas, eastern Coconino County, central
and northern Navajo and Apache counties.
* WHEN...Through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Flash flooding will be possible in creeks, normally dry
washes, swimming holes, slot canyons, and over recently burned
areas. Low-water crossings could also experience flash flooding,
which would create deadly travel conditions.

region, including the Navajo and Hopi Nations. Additional
thunderstorms are likely today and tonight, which may lead to
flash flooding.

flood safety.</description>
