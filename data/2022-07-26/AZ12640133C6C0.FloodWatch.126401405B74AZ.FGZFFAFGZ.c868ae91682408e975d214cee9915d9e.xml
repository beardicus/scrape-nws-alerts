<headline>Flood Watch issued July 26 at 1:00PM MST until July 26 at 7:45PM MST by NWS Flagstaff</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH EARLY THURSDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...All of Northern Arizona...including Navajo Nation and Hopi
Tribal Lands. Area slot canyons will be especially prone to flash
flooding.
* WHEN...Through early Thursday Morning.
* IMPACTS...Flash flooding will be possible in creeks, normally dry
washes, swimming holes and over recently burned areas. Low-water
crossings could also experience flash flooding, which would create
deadly travel conditions. Consider changing your plans if you were
going to hike, boat, or paddle-board to a slot canyon or normally
dry wash. If you do still decide to recreate, check in at a nearby
visitor center or ranger station.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Heavy rainfall has created saturated soils over parts of the
region, including the Navajo and Hopi Nations. Additional
thunderstorms are likely through Wednesday, which may lead to
flash flooding.
- Visit www.weather.gov/safety/flood for more information on
flood safety.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action
should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.
If you have plans to visit any area slot canyons...please be advised
that heavy rainfall from showers and storms that are miles away can
result in rapid and significant flash flooding of these recreational
areas!</instruction>
