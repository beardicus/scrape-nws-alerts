        <headline>Flood Advisory issued June 29 at 7:41PM EDT until June 29 at 10:45PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg SC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...Nuisance to Minor flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
expected.

* WHERE...A portion of piedmont North Carolina, including the
following counties, Cabarrus and Mecklenburg.

* WHEN...Until 1045 PM EDT.

* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks, greenways,
boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and parking lots.
Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.  A few flood-
prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.  A small culvert
washout or two is possible.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 734 PM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated heavy rain due to thunderstorms. Minor flooding is
ongoing or expected to begin shortly in the Advisory area.
Between 1 and 2 inches of rain have fallen in less than 45
minutes, which is resulting in excessive runoff across
portions of northeast Mecklenburg County and northwest
Cabarrus County.

The areas of greatest concern are along the headwaters of
Clarke Creek including Ferrelltown Creek near Eastfield
Regional Park and Skybrook Golf Club, South Prong Clarke
Creek near Ashbury Chapel Rd and Harris Rd and in
Huntersville, especially along as east of N Main St.

- Additional rainfall amounts of 0.5 to 1 inch are expected
over the area. This additional rain will exacerbate ongoing
flooding or cause new flooding to develop. If storm-total
rainfall amounts exceed 3-4 inches over the next 30-45
minutes, more significant flooding may develop and a Flash
Flood Warning may be issued.  Caution is advised near any
stream or other vulnerable area.  Seek higher ground
immediately if streams start to rise.  Please have a plan in
place should flash flooding develop and do not hesitate to
act.

- Some locations that may experience nuisance to Minor flooding
include...
Huntersville, Northeast Charlotte, West Concord, Cornelius,
Davidson, Charlotte Motor Speedway, Lake Norman and Croft.
