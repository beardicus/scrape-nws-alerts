        <headline>Flood Advisory issued June 29 at 8:04PM EDT until June 29 at 11:00PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg SC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...Nuisance to Minor flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
expected.

* WHERE...A portion of piedmont North Carolina, including the
following counties, Cabarrus and Rowan.

* WHEN...Until 1100 PM EDT.

* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks,
greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and
parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.
A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.  A
small culvert washout or two is possible.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 802 PM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated heavy rain is ongoing due to a slow-moving
thunderstorm over northwest Cabarrus County and southwest
Rowan County, impacting areas from China Grove to Landis to
Kannapolis to Cooks Crossing.  Between 1 and 2 inches of rain
have fallen in less than 30 minutes, which is resulting in
excessive runoff.  As a result, areas of nuisance to Minor
flooding are expected to develop in the Advisory area over
the next 30-75 minutes.

The areas of greatest concern include across the city of
Kannapolis and North Kannapolis, where areas of deeper poor
drainage inundation is possible, in the headwaters of Irish
Buffalo Creek near Kannapolis Lake, including near Pine St,
Tiffany Dr, and Pump Station Rd as well as in the town of
Landis and the headwaters of Grants Creek near N Meriah St
and Mt Moriah Church Rd.

- Additional rainfall amounts of 1-2 inches are possible over
the area within the next hour. This additional rain may
exacerbate ongoing flooding or cause new flooding to develop.
If storm-total rainfall amounts exceed 2-3 inches over the
next 30-60 minutes, more significant flooding may develop and
a Flash Flood Warning may be issued.  Caution is advised near
any stream or other vulnerable area.  Seek higher ground
immediately if streams start to rise.  Please have a plan in
place should flash flooding develop and do not hesitate to
act.

- Some locations that may experience nuisance to Minor flooding
include...
Kannapolis, China Grove, Landis, and Enochville
