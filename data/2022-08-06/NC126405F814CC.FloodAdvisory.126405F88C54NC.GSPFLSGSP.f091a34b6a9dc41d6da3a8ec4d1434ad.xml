Creek Rd, Jack Branch Rd, Anthony Branch Rd, and Campbell
Creek Rd.   Minor flooding is ongoing or expected to begin
shortly in the advisory area.  People in the Advisory area,
especially in southeast Graham County, need to be prepared to
seek higher ground immediately upon seeing rising streams.  A
Flash Flood Warning may be issued if heavy rainfall continues
over the next 30 minutes.

<instruction>In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
