SUNDAY...

expected.
* WHERE...Oakland, Macomb and Wayne Counties.
* WHEN...From 8 AM this morning to 10 PM EDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Hot temperatures and high humidity may cause heat

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The combination of warm muggy nights and
multiple consecutive days of heat indices over 90 will lead to
increased heat stress in Metro Detroit. The affects of the heat
will be most notable in the more urbanized areas of Southeast
Oakland, Southern Macomb and much of Wayne County, especially

<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room if
possible, stay out of the sun, and check up on relatives and
neighbors. Young children and pets should never be left unattended
in vehicles under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
