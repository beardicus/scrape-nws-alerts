<headline>Red Flag Warning issued August 06 at 8:04PM PDT until August 07 at 8:00PM PDT by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...VERY DRY AND HOT THIS WEEKEND AWAY FROM THE COAST WITH
INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE CONDITIONS OVER THE CASCADES AND COLUMBIA
GORGE...
...BREEZY OFFSHORE FLOW SATURDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH SUNDAY
MORNING...
.Offshore flow will bring a very dry and hot airmass into the
region this weekend. North-northeast winds will develop Saturday
night and continue through much of Sunday. Thermal low pressure
will settle between the Oregon Coast Range/southwest Washington
Willapa Hills and the Cascade foothills overnight and then shift
to the Cascades Sunday afternoon. This will enhance instability
over the Cascades, potentially impacting the Cedar Creek and
Potter wildfires.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM PDT SUNDAY FOR
WIND AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONES 605, 607,
AND 660...
* AFFECTED AREA...In Oregon, Fire Weather Zone 605 North Oregon
Cascade Foothills and Fire Weather Zone 607 Mt. Hood National
Forest West of Cascade Crest. In Washington, Fire Weather Zone
660 Extreme South Washington Cascades and Foothills.
* WINDS...Northeast 10 to 15 mph. Gusts to 25 mph.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...As low as 15-20 percent Sunday afternoon
through the evening, especially on exposed ridges.
* IMPACTS...Conditions may be favorable for rapid fire spread
which may threaten life and property. Use extra caution with
potential ignition sources, especially in grassy areas.
Outdoor burning is not recommended.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now, or will shortly. A combination of the
above conditions can contribute to extreme fire behavior.</instruction>
