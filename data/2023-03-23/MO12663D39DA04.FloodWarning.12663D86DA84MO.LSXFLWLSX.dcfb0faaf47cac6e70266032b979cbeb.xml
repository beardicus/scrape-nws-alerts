<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Rainfall heavier than forecast could cause river levels to rise even
higher than predicted, while lesser amounts could result in a lower
crest. The National Weather Service will monitor this developing
situation and issue follow up statements as conditions change.
