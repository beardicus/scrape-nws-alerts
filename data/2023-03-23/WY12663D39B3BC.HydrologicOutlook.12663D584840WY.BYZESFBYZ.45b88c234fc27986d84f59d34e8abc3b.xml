<description>...Ice Jam flooding on rivers and streams possible...
Ice is beginning to break up on area waterways, with ice jams
reported on portions of the Yellowstone River, Tongue River, and
Powder River. With warm temperatures in the forecast, ice will begin
to break up in more area waterways. As the ice breaks up it may
become piled up resulting in an ice jam and localized flooding.
Ice jams impede water flows, sometimes pushing water and ice over the
banks causing flooding with little warning. Water rises can be
measured in feet per minute on larger waterways, quickly inundating
surrounding land. Getting caught in flood waters caused by ice jams
means navigating through ice cold water that is full of large moving
ice chunks, which may weigh several tons. Hypothermia is likely and
injury or death is possible should you have to escape through these
floodwaters.
Those living near rivers or streams should pay close attention to
the state of the ice over the next week or two. Move any equipment
or livestock away from low lying areas adjacent to rivers or
streams. Take protective action for any threatened structures. Be
prepared to seek the safety of higher ground should waters rise.
If you are observing waterways, please do so from a safe distance and
elevation, stay away from the ice edge. Water from ice jams can rise
faster than you can move to safety and can also come in behind you
leaving you stranded in a very dangerous position. Please report any
flooding to local law enforcement and have them relay the report to
the National Weather Service.</description>
