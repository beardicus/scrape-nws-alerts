<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.
Life-threatening flooding of creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos
is likely. The heavy rains will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides
and debris flows in steep terrain, especially in and around these
areas.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
