<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Life-threatening flooding of creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos
is likely. The heavy rains will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides
and debris flows in steep terrain, especially in and around these
areas.</instruction>
