<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued August 05 at 1:23PM MDT until August 05 at 3:30PM MDT by NWS El Paso</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in El Paso Tx/Santa Teresa has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
Northwestern Sierra County in south central New Mexico...
Northern Grant County in southwestern New Mexico...
* Until 330 PM MDT.
* At 123 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing
heavy rain across the warned area. Between 0.5 and 1.5 inches of
rain have fallen. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin
shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through the Black Fire Burn Scar. The debris flow can consist
of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban
areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as
other poor drainage and low-lying areas.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
mainly rural areas of Northwestern Sierra and Northern Grant
Counties
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>This is a life threatening situation. Heavy rainfall will cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks...streams...and
ditches in the Burn Scar. Severe debris flows can also be
anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may be washed away in
places. If you encounter flood waters...climb to safety.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.</instruction>
