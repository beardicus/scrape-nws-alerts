<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued August 05 at 4:49PM EDT until August 05 at 7:45PM EDT by NWS Buffalo</headline>
<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 745 PM EDT THIS
EVENING FOR SOUTHWESTERN ONTARIO COUNTY...
At 449 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicated much of the rain with the
thunderstorms has ended across the warned area. However runoff from
these storms will continue and ponding water in low lying areas or
flow rates in creeks and streams could still rapidly increase with
flash flooding possible.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,
highways, streets and underpasses as well as other poor
drainage and low-lying areas.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Naples, Bristol Mountain and Hunt Hollow.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
