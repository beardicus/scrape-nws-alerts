heavy rain over the Poodle Burn Scar. Between 0.3 and 0.5 inches
of rain have fallen. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to

moving through the Poodle. The debris flow can consist of rock, mud,
vegetation and other loose materials.

the Poodle Burn Scar.

mainly rural areas of Central Washoe County including NV Highway
447 from south of Squaw Creek Reservoir north through Jones Canyon.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>This is a life threatening situation. Heavy rainfall will cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks...streams...and
ditches in the Poodle Burn Scar. Severe debris flows can also be
anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may be washed away in
places. If you encounter flood waters...climb to safety.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.</instruction>
