clogged with debris.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
-
Periods of moderate to heavy rainfall will bring the
potential for moderate to rapid rises along area rivers,
streams, and creeks across the region. This could result in
nuisance as well as minor flooding. Although many sites are
forecast to remain below flood stage, several locations may
reach and exceed flood stage across the region.
Ensemble guidance shows a greater than 50 percent chance of
reaching flood stage on numerous rivers and creeks across the
North Bay  and monitor stage on the San Lorenzo River at Big
Trees and numerous other locations across the San Francisco
and Monterey Bay Area by Thursday.

Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
