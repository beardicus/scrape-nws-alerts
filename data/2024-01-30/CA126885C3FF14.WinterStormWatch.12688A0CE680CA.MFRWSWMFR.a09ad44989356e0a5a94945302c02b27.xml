<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 30 at 3:33AM PST until February 01 at 4:00PM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH NOW IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY MORNING
THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snowfall accumulations of 6 to
12 inches for most roadways, elevations above 5500 feet could
see accumulations up to 2 feet. South winds 35 to 45 mph with
gusts as high as 60 mph.
* WHERE...Southern Siskiyou County. This includes portions of
Interstate 5 at Black Butte Summit and Dunsmuir, Highway 89 at
Snowmans Summit, Portions of Highway 97 near Tennant and
Sawyers Bar Road near Mount Etna.
* WHEN...From Wednesday morning through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Very
strong winds could cause tree damage and cause blowing snow to
reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The heaviest snowfall will occur late
Wednesday afternoon into Wednesday night. Snow will mostly occur
above 4000 feet, but high snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per
hour Wednesday afternoon could bring snow levels down as low as
Dunsmuir on Interstate 5 at times. Winter weather impacts like
poor visibility and snow on roads are why elevations below 4000
feet were included despite our expectation that accumulations
will be limited.

<instruction>* Stock emergency kit with tire chains, flashlight, batteries,
blankets, food, water, and medications.
* The safest place during a winter storm is indoors.
* Plan now to avoid traveling during the storm. Do not detour
during winter storms.
* A Winter Storm Watch means there is potential for significant
snow accumulations that may create dangerous travel.</instruction>
