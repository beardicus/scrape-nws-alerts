<description>...STRONG WINDS COMBINED WITH PERIODS OF HEAVY SNOW FOR THE
PRIBILOF ISLANDS THROUGH TUESDAY EVENING...
A compact storm system from Siberia is forecast to track across
the Pribilof Islands through the day Tuesday, bringing periods of
heavy snow and strong winds gusting as high as 55 mph. Expect
southeasterly winds early this morning shifting to the west in the
afternoon. Gusty winds combined with heavy snowfall may reduce
visibility to less than one mile at times due to blowing snow. The
worst conditions will be brief, likely lasting only a few hours,
first early this morning and again this afternoon. This system is
expected to bring 2-4 inches of new snowfall to the Pribilofs
during this time. Winds and snow showers will taper off tonight as
the storm moves toward the Southwest Alaska coast.</description>
