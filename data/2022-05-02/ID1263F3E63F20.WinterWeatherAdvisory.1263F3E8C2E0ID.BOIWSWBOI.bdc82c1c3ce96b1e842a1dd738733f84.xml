* WHERE...The far southeast portion of the Southwest Highlands
and southwest Southern Twin Falls County zones.
* WHEN...From 6 AM to noon MDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. Gusty winds could
bring down tree branches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...This advisory is for a small part of each

Driving will become difficult on 3 Creek Rd / Jarbidge Rd
