<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued May 02 at 4:31AM PDT until May 02 at 5:00PM PDT by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM PDT THIS
AFTERNOON ABOVE 5000 FEET...
* WHAT...Snow expected above 5000 feet. Total snow accumulations
of 6 to 10 inches. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...South Central Oregon and Southern Oregon Cascades,
including Crater Lake National Park, Diamond Lake, Lake of the
Woods, and the Cascade passes along highways 140, 138, 230,
58, and 62.
* WHEN...Until 5 PM PDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Plan for difficult travel conditions. Roads may
become slick and snow covered.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Brief snowfall rates of up to one inch
per hour with visibility less than one half of a mile are
possible during periods of heavier snowfall. This is most
likely to coincide with the Monday morning commute. Since it
is early May, roads may turn wet in some areas Monday
afternoon, but heavier snow showers could still cause snow
covered roads at times through late afternoon.
* View the hazard area in detail at

<instruction>* Slow down and allow extra time to reach your destination.
* Carry tire chains and be prepared for snow covered roads and
limited visibilities.
* See https://www.tripcheck.com for latest road conditions.
* A Winter Weather Advisory for snow means that periods of snow
will cause travel difficulties.</instruction>
