<description>...Near-Freezing Temperatures Possible Overnight into Tuesday
Morning...
Low temperatures Tuesday morning are currently forecast to bottom
out between 32 to 35 degree range across western portions of
south central Nebraska and north central Kansas, with any readings
as cold as 32 expected to be brief. However, there is some
uncertainty regarding these low temperatures, as continued
widespread cloud cover could keep readings a bit warmer than
currently forecast, and also prevent frost formation. On the other
hand, should more breaks in the cloud cover develop than
currently expected, this might allow some places to drop down to
32 degrees or slightly colder, and perhaps allow frost to develop.
Given that the most likely forecast scenario currently leans
toward low temperatures prevailing slightly above freezing in
most areas due to widespread cloud cover, no official Freeze
Warning or Frost Advisory is planned at this time. However, those
in the area with any concerns regarding sensitive outdoor
vegetation may still want to take precautions against frost or
freeze, just in case.</description>
