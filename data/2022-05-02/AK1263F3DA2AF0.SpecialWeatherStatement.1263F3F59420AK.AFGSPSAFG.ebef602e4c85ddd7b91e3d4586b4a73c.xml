<description>...Rising Water Levels and Ice Jam Potential on Interior Rivers...
Spring breakup is picking up speed in the Middle Tanana Valley and
across the Interior with the warm temperatures this past week and
over the weekend. Significant melting of the snowpack was observed
in the Fairbanks area and now that water is rapidly making its
way into the waterways. Rivers and stream around Fairbanks continue
to show significant rises on the gages that are not ice effected.
Observers report that the Chena River is mainly open from the
Steese Bridge to University Bridge in Fairbanks as well as several
hundred yards upstream and down stream of the Moose Creek Dam
with only small sheets of ice noted. Significant ice remains on
the Upper Chena and Little Chena near the Nordale Bridge. Ice on
the Tanana River also remain mostly solid with a few small open
leads. Local ice jams have been reported on the Chena River
upstream of Hunts Cabin with local inundations in low lying areas
near the river. Rising water levels could lift the ice at any
time and move in sheets with the potential for ice dams to form.
Residents should be vigilant if they are near rivers and streams
and watch for rapidly rising water. Significant overflow continues
on many of the waterways in the Interior. Local ponding of water
in the urban areas will continue to be an issue. For the latest
river information go to www.weather.gov/aprfc.</description>
