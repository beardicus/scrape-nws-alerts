<headline>Flood Warning issued September 30 at 12:58PM AKDT  by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM AKDT SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...The following area, Taiya River near Skagway in the
Northern Inner Channels.
* WHEN...Until 400 PM AKDT Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, other low-lying
areas and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1254 PM AKDT, satellite estimates and rain gauge data
indicate heavy rain across the warned area. Rapid river rises
will cause flooding of small streams, especially near the
Taiya River. Between 0.5 and 1 inch of rain has fallen.
Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches are possible.
- Areas along low lying portions of the Chilkoot Trail and near
the Dyea campground is the most likely place to experience
flooding.
- For Taiya River near Skagway:
At 1:00pm the stage was 15.81 feet.
Flood Stage is 16.5 feet.
Forecast: A crest around 18.4 feet is expected around 10:00am
Saturday.
Impacts:
At 17.0 feet: The National Park Service advises against
boating and other recreational water-based activities on the
Taiya River. Trail orientation and navigation begins to
become difficult and may hinder route-finding for several
hundred feet. Water will be knee deep or higher in places
along the lower portions of the trail.
At 17.5 feet: The National Park Service may close the
Chilkoot Trail due to flooding impacts associated with high
water in the surrounding watershed.
At 19.0 feet: Campground 3/4 mi downstream of bridge starts
to flood.  There can also be considerable bank erosion near
the campground.
- If you live near or along the Taiya River or in Dyea should stay
alert and be prepared to take action.</description>
