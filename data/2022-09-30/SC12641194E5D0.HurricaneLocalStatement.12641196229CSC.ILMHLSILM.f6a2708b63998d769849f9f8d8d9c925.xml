SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Post-tropical Storm Ian will continue to weaken as it moves farther
inland across North Carolina. Wind speeds will gradually diminish and
rain should come to an end, although tidal flooding will continue
along the lower Cape Fear River tonight through the weekend. Downed
trees and ongoing power outages will make travel hazardous tonight.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
southeast North Carolina and northeast South Carolina. Remain well
sheltered from hazardous wind having possible limited impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes is possible. Unsecured lightweight objects may be
blown about.
- Some large limbs may break from trees. A few shallow rooted or
weak trees may snap or be knocked down. Some fences and roadway
signs damaged.
- Scattered power and communications outages are possible.
* OTHER COASTAL HAZARDS:
Significant beach erosion occurred earlier today. Large cliffs were
cut into the beaches and could be dangerous to foot traffic. In areas
where significant storm surge flooding occurred, streets may have
significant deposits of sand on them and travel could be hazardous.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Remain safely sheltered from the storm. Stay
inside and away from windows. Locate your battery powered radio and
flashlight from your Emergency Supplies Kit. Keep these items close.
Continue to keep your cell phone well charged for as long as
possible. If you lose power, use it more sparingly and mainly for
personal emergencies and check-ins. Do not overload communications
systems with idle chatter.
