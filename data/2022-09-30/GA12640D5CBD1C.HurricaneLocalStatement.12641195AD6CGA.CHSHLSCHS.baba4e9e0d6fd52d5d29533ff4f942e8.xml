SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Ian will continue to shift farther inland over northeastern South
Carolina before moving into North Carolina tonight. Tropical storm
force wind gusts and lingering flooding from earlier rainfall will
persist into the evening, mainly over South Carolina, though
conditions will continue to improve. Hazardous marine and surf
conditions will persist along the coast and Atlantic waters.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
Charleston Tri-County. Remain well sheltered from hazardous
wind having additional limited impacts. If realized,
these impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or uprooted,
but with greater numbers in places where trees are shallow
rooted.
- Some roads impassable due to debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded locations. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways, especially for high
profile vehicles.
- Isolated to scattered power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia,
little to no impact is anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
the Charleston Tri-County. Remain well guarded against locally
hazardous flood waters having additional limited impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- Localized rainfall flooding could prompt a few rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries could quickly rise with swifter
currents. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches could
become swollen and overflow in spots.
- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in normally
vulnerable spots. Rapid ponding of water could occur at
underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage areas. Several
storm drains and retention ponds become near-full and begin to
overflow. Some brief road and bridge closures.
Elsewhere across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia,
little to no impact is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
If you are prone to flooding or in an area under a storm surge watch
or warning, be prepared for the possibility of a quick and dramatic
rise in water levels.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
