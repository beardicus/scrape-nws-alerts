SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Ian continues as a hurricane over the Georgia Atlantic waters, and
is moving northward towards the Carolinas. Ian is expected to remain a
hurricane as it treks through the Atlantic waters making landfall
along the Carolinas coast later today.
A storm surge warning remains in effect along the coast as well as the
St Johns River with dangerous storm surge inundation along the coast,
Intracoastal waterway and along the St Johns River during high tide.
Moderate to major flooding will be possible with the best chance along the
northeast Florida intracoastal waterways south of Jacksonville and
along the St. Johns River. Trapped tides in the St. Johns river will
exacerbate flooding potentially into next week for areas along the St.
Johns river.
Tropical Storm and Hurricane warnings remain in effect over the
coastal waters through this afternoon. Coastal impacts will continue
into this weekend with high risk of rip currents, beach erosion and
high surf and seas.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from surge continue across coastal southeast Georgia,
coastal northeast Florida, Intracoastal waterway, and the St. Johns
River basin. Remain well away from life-threatening surge having
possible additional impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
Also, protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across inland Glynn, Nassau, and Camden counties.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Do not enter evacuated areas until officials have given the all clear
to return.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
If you are prone to flooding or in an area under a storm surge
warning, be prepared for the possibility of a quick and dramatic rise
in water levels.
* ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION:
- For information on appropriate preparations see ready.gov
- For information on creating an emergency plan see getagameplan.org
- For additional disaster preparedness information see redcross.org
