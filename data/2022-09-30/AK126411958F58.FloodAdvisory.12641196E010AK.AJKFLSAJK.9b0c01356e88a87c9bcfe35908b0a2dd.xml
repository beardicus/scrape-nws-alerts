* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 835 PM AKDT, satellite estimates and rain gauge data
indicate heavy rain across the advisory area. Minor flooding
is ongoing or expected to begin shortly, especially near the
Chilkat and Klehini Rivers along with Porcupine Creek.
Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches are possible.
- Areas around mile post 14 and 24 of the Haines Highway and

minor flooding.

Forecast: A crest around 128.5 feet is expected around
10:00pm Saturday.
Impacts:
At 127.0 feet: This is bankfull stage, but water can encroach
the Haines Highway, south of Klukwan.  Note that the Chilkat
River is highly braided, if and when it shifts channels, our
present bankfull and flood stages will be outdated.

some other minor flooding near 14 mile and 25 mile boat
launches and along Porcupine Road.
