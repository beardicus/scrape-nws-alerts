SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Ian made landfall at 2:05 PM this afternoon near Georgetown, South
Carolina. As Ian continues inland toward the Pee Dee region this
evening it will weaken, moving into North Carolina late tonight.
Additional impacts will be limited to the Midlands and Pee Dee this
evening and tonight. Periods of heavy rainfall will continue with
highest amounts along and north of the I-26 corridor, with flash
flooding possible. Tropical storm force winds are possible this
evening across the Midlands and Pee Dee regions.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
portions of the Midlands and Pee Dee regions of South Carolina. Remain well
sheltered from dangerous wind having additional significant impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
Elsewhere across the western Midlands and east central Georgia,
little to no additional impacts are anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
portions of the Midlands and Pee Dee of South Carolina. Remain well guarded
against life-threatening flood waters having possible extensive impacts.
If realized, these impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, arroyos, and
ditches may become dangerous rivers. In mountain areas,
destructive runoff may run quickly down valleys while
increasing susceptibility to rockslides and mudslides. Flood
control systems and barriers may become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.
Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with
underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.
Many road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
Elsewhere across the western Midlands and east central Georgia,
little to no additional impacts are anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Keep cell phones well charged. Cell phone chargers for automobiles
can be helpful, but be aware of your risk for deadly carbon monoxide
poisoning if your car is left idling in a garage or other poorly
ventilated area.
If in a place that is vulnerable to high wind, such as near large
trees, a manufactured home, upper floors of a high-rise building, or
on a boat, consider moving to a safer shelter before the onset of
strong winds or flooding.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
