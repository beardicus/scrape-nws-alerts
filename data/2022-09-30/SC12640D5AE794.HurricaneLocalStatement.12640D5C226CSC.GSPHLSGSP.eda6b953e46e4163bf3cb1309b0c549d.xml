SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Ian, a category 1 storm, will make landfall again on the
South Carolina coast this afternoon. It will track north northwest
across the Carolinas, weakening to a tropical storm tonight,
eventually moving north into Virginia on Saturday. Strong and gusty
winds will be widespread around the region throughout the day, but
peaking this afternoon. Heavy rainfall is expected mainly this
afternoon and evening, and may cause localized flash flooding. The
flood threat will primarily affect the North Carolina Piedmont,
northern North Carolina mountains, and eastern Upstate.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Protect against dangerous wind having possible significant impacts
across I-77 corridor and ridgetops in the Carolina mountains. Potential
impacts in this area include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
Also, protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts
across the remainder of the western Carolinas and northeast Georgia.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across the western Carolinas east of I-26 as well as
the mountains of western North Carolina and the Blue Ridge Escarpment.
Potential impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, arroyos, and
ditches may become dangerous rivers. In mountain areas,
destructive runoff may run quickly down valleys while
increasing susceptibility to rockslides and mudslides. Flood
control systems and barriers may become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.
Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with
underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.
Many road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
It is important to remain calm, informed, and focused during an
emergency. Be patient and helpful with those you encounter.
Rapidly rising flood waters are deadly. If you are in a flood-prone
area, consider moving to higher ground. Never drive through a flooded
roadway. Remember, turn around don`t drown!
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
