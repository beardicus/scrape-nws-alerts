<instruction>A Flood Watch for flash flooding means there is a potential for
rapid onset flooding based on current forecasts. Flash flooding is a
very dangerous situation and may impact areas that do not typically
flood. Please monitor the latest forecasts and be prepared to take
action quickly should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.
Low-lying areas adjacent to streams, including campgrounds, are
especially vulnerable to flooding. If you live or are vacationing
next to a stream, please have a plan in place to seek higher ground
once heavy rainfall develops. Flash floods can occur quickly and
overwhelm adjacent low-lying areas with little warning. Once the
stream starts to rise, you may only have minutes to evacuate. Flash
floods can cause catastrophic damage and be powerful enough to sweep
away campers, vehicles, and mobile homes. Consider temporarily
relocating away from streams until the heavy rainfall threat passes.</instruction>
