EVENING...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT... Minor tidal flooding of around 1ft will be possible
over the SW Florida coast during periods of high tide through
Friday. Please do not venture out into floodwater. Floodwater
may contain hazardous materials, such as downed power lines,
hazardous waste, and physical objects. You never know how deep
floodwater is and what may be in floodwater. The best way to
protect yourself is to stay out of floodwater and sheltered in
place while water recedes. Additional flooding may be possible
today especially during high tide. Please heed the advice of
local emergency management officials and first responders as
search and rescue efforts are ongoing. Dangerous rip currents
will also be possible through Friday.
* WHERE...Coastal Collier County.
* WHEN...Through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...Some water on low lying roads and property. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water.</description>
<instruction>Do not drive through flooded roadways.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
