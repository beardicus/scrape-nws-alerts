SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Ian will approach the South Carolina coast today, making
landfall in the Hurricane Warning area this afternoon. Conditions will
steadily deteriorate this morning with the risk for life-threatening
storm surge inundation, flooding rains, and tropical storm force winds
rapidly increasing as the hurricane approaches the coast. Wind gusts
to hurricane force could occur along parts of the lower South Carolina
coast, including Charleston Harbor.
The combination of life-threatening storm surge inundation and heavy
rainfall could produce areas of considerable urban and flash flooding,
mainly across southern South Carolina including Downtown Charleston.
In addition, dangerous marine and surf conditions will persist with
significant beach and lakeshore erosion continuing at the beaches and
around Lake Moultrie. Conditions will begin to improve across
Southeast Georgia this afternoon and this evening across Southeast
South Carolina as a weakening Ian moves farther inland into North
Carolina.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding along
the coast, especially the lower South Carolina coast. Remain well away
from life-threatening surge having possible extensive impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate
shorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near rivers
and creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by battering
waves. Structural damage to buildings, with several washing
away. Damage compounded by floating debris. Locations may be
uninhabitable for an extended period.
- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads
washed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control systems and
barriers could become stressed.
- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.
- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many
small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and stranded.
- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.
- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in surge
waters.
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across south
coastal South Carolina. Remain well sheltered from life-threatening wind
having possible extensive impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some window,
door, and garage door failures leading to structural damage.
Mobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed. Damage
accentuated by airborne projectiles. Some locations may be
uninhabitable for weeks.
- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne
projectiles outside.
- Large trees snapped or uprooted.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and access routes
impassable.
- Large areas with power and communications outages, which could
persist for days.
- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.
Potential impacts from the main wind event are also now unfolding
across interior Southeast South Carolina and north coastal Georgia.
Remain well sheltered from dangerous wind having possible limited to
significant impacts.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
the coast. Remain well guarded against life-threatening flood waters
having possible extensive impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding could prompt many rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries could rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple locations. Small streams, creeks, canals, ditches may
become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and barriers
could become stressed.
- Flood waters could enter many structures within multiple
communities; some structures become uninhabitable or are washed
away. Flood waters could cover multiple escape routes. Streets
and parking lots become rivers of moving water with underpasses
submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous. Many road and
bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
- Drinking water and sewer services could be negatively impacted.
- Hazardous containers and materials could possibly be present in
flood waters.
* OTHER COASTAL HAZARDS:
Life-threatening surf conditions, including dangerous rip currents, high
waves, as well as beach and lakeshore erosion are expected across coastal
portions of Southeast South Carolina and Southeast Georgia, including
Lake Moultrie.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
near the ocean or a large inland lake, in a low-lying or poor
drainage area, in a valley, or near an already swollen river, plan to
move to safe shelter on higher ground.
Storm surge is the leading killer associated with tropical storms and
hurricanes! Make sure you are in a safe area away from the surge
zone. Even if you are not in a surge-prone area, you could find
yourself cutoff by flood waters during and after the storm. Heed
evacuation orders issued by the local authorities.
Rapidly rising flood waters are deadly. If you are in a flood-prone
area, consider moving to higher ground. Never drive through a flooded
roadway. Remember, turn around don`t drown!
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
