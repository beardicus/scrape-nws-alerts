<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued September 30 at 3:55PM EDT until October 03 at 7:00PM EDT by NWS Philadelphia - Mount Holly</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM EDT SUNDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY AFTERNOON...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM NOON SUNDAY TO 7 PM EDT
MONDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of up to
8 feet in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to
one foot of inundation above ground level expected in low-
lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways. For the High
Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Eastern Monmouth County.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory and High Rip Current Risk,
until 6 PM EDT Sunday. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from noon
Sunday to 7 PM EDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...With minor tidal flooding, flooding begins on the most
vulnerable roads in coastal and bayside communities, and along
inland tidal waterways. Some partial or full road closures are
possible. High surf will lead to dangerous swimming and surfing
conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep
even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The coastal flooding and high rip current
risk may linger into Tuesday.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>During coastal flooding, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of unknown
depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
If caught in a rip current, relax and float. Don`t swim against
the current. If able, swim in a direction following the shoreline.
If unable to escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
