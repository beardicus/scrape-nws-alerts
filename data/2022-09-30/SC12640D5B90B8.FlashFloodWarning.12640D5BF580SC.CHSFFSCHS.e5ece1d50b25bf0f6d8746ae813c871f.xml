<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON EDT TODAY FOR
BERKELEY AND CHARLESTON COUNTIES...
At 933 AM EDT, county officials reported numerous roads closed
across downtown Charleston due to flooding. This flooding was a
result of 2 to 3 inches of rainfall that fell earlier this morning.
A band of moderate to heavy rain will arrive over the area during
the mid to late morning hours. This band could produce an additional
2 to 4 inches of rainfall. The arrival rain band is expected to
coincide with high tide, flash flooding is expected to develop and
expand across Downtown Charleston area, especially near the
perimeter of the Charleston Peninsula. In addition, water levels on
Church Creek near West Ashley have steadily risen this morning. The
arrival of the mid to late morning rain band could result in the
creek to rise above flood stage.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms producing
flash flooding.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Life threatening flash flooding of creeks and streams,
urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
North Charleston, Mount Pleasant, Downtown Charleston, James
Island, West Ashley, Daniel Island, I-26/I-526 Interchange, Fort
Sumter, Johns Island, Isle Of Palms, Folly Beach, Sullivan`s
Island, Charles Towne Landing, Charleston Naval Complex, Maybank
Bridge, James Island County Park, Fort Johnson, Don Holt Bridge
and Sullivans Island.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
High tide will inhibit runoff of heavy rain, flooding areas of poor
drainage in Downtown Charleston. Areas most prone to flooding
include the Market, Crosstown, East Bay Street and Morrison Drive.
Flooding is likely in low-lying coastal areas where high tide will
inhibit runoff of heavy rain.</instruction>
