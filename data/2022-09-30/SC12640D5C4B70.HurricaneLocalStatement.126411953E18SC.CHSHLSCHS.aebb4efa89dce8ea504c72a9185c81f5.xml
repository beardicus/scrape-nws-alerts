SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Ian has made landfall over the northern South Carolina
coast this afternoon. The risk for life-threatening storm surge
inundation, flooding rains, and tropical storm force winds will
continue through the afternoon, especially over South Carolina. Wind
gusts to hurricane force could also occur along parts of the lower
South Carolina coast, including the Charleston Harbor.
Ongoing heavy rainfall is producing areas of considerable urban and
flash flooding, mainly across southern South Carolina including
Downtown Charleston. In addition, dangerous marine and surf conditions
will persist with significant beach and lakeshore erosion continuing
at the beaches and around Lake Moultrie. Conditions will continue to
improve across Southeast Georgia this afternoon and this evening
across Southeast South Carolina as a weakening Ian moves farther
inland and into North Carolina.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
coastal South Carolina. Remain well guarded against life-threatening
flood waters having additional extensive impacts. If realized, these
impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding could prompt many rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries could rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple locations. Small streams, creeks, canals, ditches may
become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and barriers
could become stressed.
- Flood waters could enter many structures within multiple
communities; some structures become uninhabitable or are washed
away. Flood waters could cover multiple escape routes. Streets
and parking lots become rivers of moving water with underpasses
submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous. Many road and
bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
- Drinking water and sewer services could be negatively impacted.
- Hazardous containers and materials could possibly be present in
flood waters.
Elsewhere across southeast Georgia, little to no impact is
anticipated.
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
south coastal South Carolina. Remain well sheltered from
life-threatening wind having possible extensive impacts. If realized,
these impacts include:
- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some window,
door, and garage door failures leading to structural damage.
Mobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed. Damage
accentuated by airborne projectiles. Some locations may be
uninhabitable for weeks.
- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne
projectiles outside.
- Large trees snapped or uprooted.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and access routes
impassable.
- Large areas with power and communications outages, which could
persist for days.
- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.
Potential impacts from the main wind event are also now unfolding
across interior Southeast South Carolina and Georgia. Remain well
sheltered from dangerous wind having possible limited to
significant impacts.
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding along
the coast, especially the lower South Carolina coast. Remain well
away from life-threatening surge having possible extensive impacts.
If realized, these impacts include:
- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate
shorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near rivers
and creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by battering
waves. Structural damage to buildings, with several washing
away. Damage compounded by floating debris. Locations may be
uninhabitable for an extended period.
- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads
washed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control systems and
barriers could become stressed.
- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.
- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many
small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and stranded.
- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.
- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in surge
waters.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
near the ocean or a large inland lake, in a low-lying or poor
drainage area, in a valley, or near an already swollen river, plan to
move to safe shelter on higher ground.
Storm surge is the leading killer associated with tropical storms and
hurricanes! Make sure you are in a safe area away from the surge
zone. Even if you are not in a surge-prone area, you could find
yourself cutoff by flood waters during and after the storm. Heed
evacuation orders issued by the local authorities.
Rapidly rising flood waters are deadly. If you are in a flood-prone
area, consider moving to higher ground. Never drive through a flooded
roadway. Remember, turn around don`t drown!
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
