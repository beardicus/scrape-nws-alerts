<headline>Flood Advisory issued September 30 at 8:06PM EDT until September 30 at 10:00PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of piedmont North Carolina, including the
following county, Cabarrus.
* WHEN...Until 1100 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 802 PM EDT, Doppler radar was indicating heavy tropical
showers redeveloping across the region and this additional
rainfall may be enough to promote flooding of low-lying areas
across the county.  Isolated rainfall totals of around 3
inches are possible, especially south of highway 49, and in
parts of the Rocky River headwaters.  Spotty urban type flood
issues may also be seen throughout greater Concord.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Kannapolis, Downtown Concord, West Concord, Harrisburg,
Enochville, Mt Pleasant, Charlotte Motor Speedway, Coddle
Creek Reservoir and Midland.
