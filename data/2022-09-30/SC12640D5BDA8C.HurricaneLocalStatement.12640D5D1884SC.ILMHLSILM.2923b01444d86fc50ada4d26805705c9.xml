SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Ian will make landfall along South Carolina`s Grand
Strand beaches this afternoon, accompanied by storm surge flooding
over four feet in depth and significant beach erosion. Heavy rainfall
may result in inland flash flooding, and wind gusts near the coast
will reach hurricane force. Even across inland portions of the Pee
Dee region and across southeastern North Carolina, wind gusts of 50 to
70 mph are expected and may result in downed trees and power outages.
Ian should weaken as it moves inland tonight, with weather conditions
slowly improving late tonight.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
northeastern South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina. Impacts
will be most severe along the South Carolina coastline. Remain
well sheltered from life-threatening wind having possible extensive
impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Some structural damage is likely, with buildings receiving roof
damage as well as window, door, and garage door failures.
Mobile homes may suffer severe damage, with some destroyed.
Damage may be enhanced by projectiles. Locations may
be inaccessible or uninhabitable for some time after the storm
passes.
- Widespread large limbs will be down and many trees snapped or
uprooted, along with fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Roads will be blocked in many areas as a result of large
debris, especially within urban or heavily wooded areas.
Several bridges, causeways, and elevated roadways will likely
become unsafe.
- Some areas will suffer from power and communication
outages.
- Poorly secured small craft may break from their
moorings.
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across
The Grand Strand coast, the tidal portion of the Cape Fear River,
and coastal Brunswick County, NC. Remain well away from life-threatening
surge having possible extensive impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- Large areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding
enhanced by battering waves. Structural damage to buildings is
likely. Damage will be compounded by floating debris. Some locations
may become uninhabitable for an extended period.
- Inundation is likely to impact vulnerable homes along tidal
creeks and waterways farther inland.
- Drinking water and sewer services may become impacted
by the storm surge. Surge waters will contain hazardous
materials.
- Large sections of coastal roads will become flooded, or
wash-out altogether.
- Severe beach erosion is expected with significant dune loss.
Sands from displaced dunes will likely deposit onto the barrier
island roads.
- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers is
possible.
- Navigation may be difficult, especially near inlets and
waterways, as some navigational aids may be off station or
missing. Debris is possible in the waterways and other
navigable channels.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
northeastern South Carolina and interior Southeastern North Carolina.
Remain well guarded against life-threatening flood waters having possible
extensive impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Significant flooding from rainfall may prompt evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and streams may rapidly overflow their banks in multiple
places. Creeks and ditches will flood and may contain strong
currents.
- Flood waters may enter many structures, and some may become
uninhabitable. Some road scours or complete road failures will
be possible. Many streets and parking lots may flood, and may
be impacted by flowing water. Many road and low-lying bridge
closures are possible with some weakened or washed away. Driving
conditions will be dangerous. The delivery of drinking water and sewer
services may be interrupted. Flood waters may be polluted and
contain hazardous materials.
* TORNADOES:
Potential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across southeast
North Carolina and northeast South Carolina. Remain well braced
against a tornado event having possible limited
impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Tornadoes can cause damage to trees, vehicles, boats, and
buildings. Unsecured mobile homes and poorly constructed
structures are particularly vulnerable.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Remain safely sheltered from the storm. Stay inside and away from windows.
Listen for updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Locate
your battery powered radio and flashlight from your Emergency Supplies Kit.
Keep these items close.
During the peak of the storm, keep your shoes on and rain gear handy.
Boots and tennis shoes offer the best foot protection if you become
unexpectedly exposed to the elements.
Continue to keep your cell phone well charged for as long as
possible. If you lose power, use it more sparingly and mainly for
personal emergencies and check-ins. Do not overload communications
systems with idle chatter.
