<headline>Flood Watch issued September 30 at 4:15PM EDT  by NWS Charleston</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EDT TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of southeast South Carolina, including the
following areas, Charleston, Dorchester, Inland Berkeley and Tidal
Berkeley.
* WHEN...Until Midnight EDT tonight.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. Storm drains and ditches may
become clogged with debris. Extensive street flooding and flooding
of creeks and rivers are possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Since much of the area received 4 to 8 inches with locally
higher amounts from Ian, conditions will be slow in
improving. As a result, the Flood Watch continues through
midnight.

should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.
Be prepared to protect life and property, especially in areas prone
to flooding. If flooding develops, move to higher ground
immediately. If driving, be prepared for flooded roadways and
possible road closures.</instruction>
