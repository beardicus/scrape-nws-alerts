SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Post-tropical Cyclone Ian will move farther inland across northeastern
South Carolina this evening and then into North Carolina overnight.
Strong winds and a threat of tornadoes this afternoon and this evening
will diminish overnight, but additional coastal flooding is expected
at the beaches during tonight`s high tide. Downed trees and ongoing
power outages will make travel hazardous tonight.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
southeastern North Carolina and continue across northeastern South Carolina.
Remain well sheltered from dangerous wind having additional significant
impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding, along with damage to porches
and awnings. A few buildings may experience window, door, and
garage door failures. Damage to vulnerable structures such as
carports, sheds and mobile homes is possible.
- Large limbs will be down with some trees snapped or
uprooted. Several fences and roadway signs may become blown
over. Some roads may become impassable due to large debris
blocking the roadway, especially within urban or heavily wooded
locations. Some bridges, causeways, and elevated roads may be
impacted by high winds making driving on them hazardous.
- Scattered power and communications outages are possible, but
more prevalent in areas with above ground lines.
- Small craft that are not properly moored may break loose.
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across
the beaches and tidal rivers in the Grand Strand and Cape Fear areas.
Remain well away from life-threatening surge having additional impacts.
If realized, these impacts include:
- Areas of storm surge inundation enhanced by breaking waves are
possible along the barrier islands.
- Sections of near-shore roads may become weakened or washed out,
especially in vulnerable low-lying areas.
- Major beach erosion is possible with heavy surf and elevated
water levels impacting or breaching the dunes.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Small craft may break away from moorings, especially
in unprotected anchorages.
- Navigation may be difficult near inlets and waterways, as
navigational aids may be off station or missing.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
interior portions of northeastern South Carolina and southeastern
North Carolina. Remain well guarded against life-threatening flood waters
having possible extensive impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Flooding from rainfall may prompt evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and streams may rapidly overflow their banks in multiple
places. Creeks and ditches will flood and may contain strong
currents.
- Flood waters may enter many structures. Streets and parking
lots may flood, and may be impacted by flowing water. Driving
conditions may be dangerous.
* TORNADOES:
Only an isolated risk for tornadoes exists across southeastern North
Carolina this evening.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Remain safely sheltered from the storm. Stay
inside and away from windows. Listen for updates and be ready in case
you lose electrical power. Locate your battery powered radio and
flashlight from your Emergency Supplies Kit. Keep these items close.
During the peak of the storm, keep your shoes on and rain gear handy.
Boots and tennis shoes offer the best foot protection if you become
unexpectedly exposed to the elements.
Continue to keep your cell phone well charged for as long as
possible. If you lose power, use it more sparingly and mainly for
personal emergencies and check-ins.
