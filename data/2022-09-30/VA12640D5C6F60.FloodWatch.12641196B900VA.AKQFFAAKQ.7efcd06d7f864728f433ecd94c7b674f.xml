<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of eastern Virginia and southeast Virginia,
including the following counties, in eastern Virginia,
Northampton. In southeast Virginia, Accomack.
* WHEN...Through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Tropical Cyclone Ian made a second landfall in South Carolina
today and will track northwest across the Carolinas tonight.
Several rounds of moderate to heavy rain are likely in the
watch area today through tonight before the heaviest rain
pushes offshore Saturday morning. On average, 2 to 4 inches
of rain are expected, with localized amounts of 4 to 6 inches
possible. Despite the dry antecedent conditions, this will
likely be enough to result in a few instances of flooding,
especially in urban and flood prone areas.
