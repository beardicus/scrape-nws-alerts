<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued September 30 at 11:51AM EDT until September 30 at 4:00PM EDT by NWS Charleston</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Charleston has extended the
* Flash Flood Warning for...
Berkeley County in southeastern South Carolina...
Charleston County in southeastern South Carolina...
* Until 400 PM EDT.
* At 1142 AM EDT, Charleston Police reported that the Crosstown was
closed due to flooding. In addition, numerous streets across
Downtown Charleston were closed due to flood waters. This flooding
was a result of 3 to 5 inches of rainfall that has fallen so far
today. A band of heavy rainfall may continue to produce torrential
rainfall rates over Charleston and the surrounding areas well into
this afternoon. This band may produce an additional 2 to 3 inches
of rain. Little to no storm water drainage will occur until the
tide waters fall later this afternoon, likely producing flash
flooding across the city of Charleston. In addition, water levels
on Church Creek near West Ashley continue to steadily rise, on
this pace the creek could exceed flood stage later this afternoon.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Rain bands with
Hurricane Ian.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Life threatening flash flooding of creeks and streams,
urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
North Charleston, Mount Pleasant, Downtown Charleston, James
Island, West Ashley, Daniel Island, I-26/I-526 Interchange, Fort
Sumter, Johns Island, Isle Of Palms, Folly Beach, Sullivan`s
Island, Charles Towne Landing, Charleston Naval Complex, Maybank
Bridge, James Island County Park, Fort Johnson, Don Holt Bridge
and Sullivans Island.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
High tide will inhibit runoff of heavy rain, flooding areas of poor
drainage in Downtown Charleston. Areas most prone to flooding
include the Market, Crosstown, East Bay Street and Morrison Drive.
Flooding is likely in low-lying coastal areas where high tide will
inhibit runoff of heavy rain.</instruction>
