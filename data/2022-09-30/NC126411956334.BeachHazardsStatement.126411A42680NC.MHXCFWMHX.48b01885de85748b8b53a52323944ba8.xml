<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM EDT SATURDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON EDT SATURDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 6 to
9 feet in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, 1 to 2
feet of inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways. For the Beach Hazards Statement,
dangerous rip currents and large breaking waves in the surf
zone.
* WHERE...Northern Outer Banks.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until noon EDT Saturday.
For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 8 AM EDT Saturday. For
the Beach Hazards Statement, through Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Dangerous swimming and
surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip currents
can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper
water. Dangerous shore break can throw a swimmer or surfer
head first into the bottom causing neck and back injuries.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most likely time for strong rip
currents to occur is a couple hours either side of low tide,
which will occur around noon Saturday.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
