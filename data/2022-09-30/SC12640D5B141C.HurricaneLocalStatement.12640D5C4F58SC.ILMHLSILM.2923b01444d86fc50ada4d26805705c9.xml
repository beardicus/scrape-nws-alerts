SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Ian was moving north over the Atlantic waters off of the Southeast
coast and will make landfall over South Carolina as a hurricane later
today before rapidly weakening as it heads northwest through the
Carolinas toward the mountains. The greatest impacts will last today
into tonight, increasing gusty winds expected to reach
tropical-storm-force with mainly hurricane force gusts. There is
potential for hurricane force winds as well, mainly near the coast of
South Carolina. Confidence is increasing on more widespread impacts
from wind and storm surge inundation, especially along the northeast
South Carolina coast. Heavy rain, coastal flooding, and beach erosion
are also expected. Rain tapers off tonight, but coastal flooding
issues may linger a little longer.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for life-threatening wind having possible extensive impacts
across northeast South Carolina and southeast North Carolina. Potential
impacts in this area include:
- Some structural damage is likely, with buildings receiving roof
damage as well as window, door, and garage door failures.
Mobile homes potentially suffering severe damage, with some
destroyed. Damage may be enhanced by projectiles. Locations may
be inaccessible or uninhabitable for some time after the storm
passes.
- Widespread large limbs will be down and many trees snapped or
uprooted, along with fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Roads will be blocked in many areas as a result of large
debris, especially within urban or heavily wooded areas.
Several bridges, causeways, and elevated roadways will likely
become unsafe.
- Widespread areas will suffer from power and communication
outages.
- Several poorly secured small craft may break from their
moorings.
Also, prepare for dangerous wind having possible limited to
significant impacts across northeast South Carolina and
southeast North Carolina.
* SURGE:
Protect against life-threatening surge having possible extensive
impacts across coastal South Carolina and coastal southeastern North
Carolina. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Large areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding
enhanced by battering waves. Structural damage to buildings is
likely, with several potentially washing away. Damage will be
compounded by floating debris. Some locations may become
uninhabitable for an extended period.
- Inundation is likely to impact vulnerable homes along tidal
creeks and waterways farther inland.
- Drinking water and sewer services will likely become impacted
by the storm surge. Surge waters will contain hazardous
materials.
- Large sections of coastal roads will become flooded, or
wash-out altogether.
- Severe beach erosion is expected with significant dune loss.
Sands from displaced dunes will likely deposit onto the barrier
island roads.
- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers is
possible. Many small craft broken away from moorings,
especially in unprotected anchorages with some lifted onshore
and stranded inland.
- Navigation may be difficult, especially near inlets and
waterways, as some navigational aids may be off station or
missing. Debris is possible in the waterways and other
navigable channels.
Also, protect against life-threatening surge having possible
significant impacts across the lower Cape Fear River in inland New
Hanover.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across northeastern South Carolina. Potential
impacts include:
- Major flooding from rainfall may prompt evacuations and
numerous rescues.
- Rivers and streams may rapidly overflow their banks in multiple
places. Creeks and ditches will flood and may contain strong
currents.
- Flood waters may enter many structures, and some may become
uninhabitable. Some road scours or complete road failures will
be possible, along with the potential for sinkholes. Many
streets and parking lots may flood, and may be impacted by
flowing water. Many road and low-lying bridge closures are
possible with some weakened or washed away. Driving conditions
will be dangerous.The delivery of drinking water and sewer
services may be interrupted. Flood waters may be polluted and
contain hazardous materials.
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible
significant impacts across southeastern North Carolina.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts
across southeast North Carolina and northeast South Carolina.
Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Tornadoes can cause damage to trees, vehicles, boats, and
buildings. Unsecured mobile homes and poorly constructed
structures are particularly vulnerable.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
Closely monitor NOAA Weather Radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for possible changes to the
forecast.
