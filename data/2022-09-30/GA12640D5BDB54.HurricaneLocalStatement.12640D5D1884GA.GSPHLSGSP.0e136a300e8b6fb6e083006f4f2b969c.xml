SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Ian is expected to make landfall on the South Carolina
coast this afternoon. It will track northward across the Carolinas
through tonight, weakening and evolving to an extratropical storm,
with the remnants eventually moving north into Virginia on Saturday
afternoon. Strong and gusty winds will be widespread around the region
throughout the afternoon and into tonight, but peaking late this
afternoon or early this evening. Heavy rainfall is expected mainly
this afternoon and evening, and may cause localized flash flooding.
The flood threat will primarily affect the Piedmont, northern
foothills, and northern mountains of North Carolina, and the eastern
Upstate of South Carolina.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
the western Piedmont of North Carolina and eastern Piedmont of South
Carolina, including the Charlotte metro area. Potential impacts in this
area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across the western Carolinas and northeast Georgia, occasional
strong wind gusts could knock down a few tree limbs or power lines.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across the western Carolinas east of I-26 as well
as the mountains of western North Carolina and the Blue Ridge
Escarpment. Potential impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, arroyos, and
ditches may become dangerous rivers. In mountain areas,
destructive runoff may run quickly down valleys while
increasing susceptibility to rockslides and mudslides. Flood
control systems and barriers may become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.
Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with
underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.
Many road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
It is important to remain calm, informed, and focused during an
emergency. Be patient and helpful with those you encounter.
Rapidly rising flood waters are deadly. If you are in a flood-prone
area, consider moving to higher ground. Never drive through a flooded
roadway. Remember, turn around don`t drown!
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
