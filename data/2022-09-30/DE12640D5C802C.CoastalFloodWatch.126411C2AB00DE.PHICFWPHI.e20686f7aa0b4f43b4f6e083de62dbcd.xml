<instruction>During coastal flooding, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of unknown
depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
If caught in a rip current, relax and float. Don`t swim against
the current. If able, swim in a direction following the shoreline.
If unable to escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
