<headline>Flood Watch issued September 30 at 6:18AM EDT until October 01 at 4:00AM EDT by NWS Wakefield</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of south central Virginia, including the
following counties, Brunswick, Lunenburg and Mecklenburg.
* WHEN...Through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Tropical Cyclone Ian is expected to make a second landfall in
South Carolina today and track northwest across the Carolinas
tonight. Several rounds of moderate to heavy rain are likely
in the watch area today through tonight before the heaviest
rain pushes offshore Saturday morning. On average, 2 to 4
inches of rain are expected, with localized amounts of 4 to 6
inches possible. Despite the dry antecedent conditions, this
will likely be enough to result in a few instances of
flooding, especially in urban and flood prone areas.

to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
