creeks, canals, and ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken
foundations. Several places could experience expanded areas
of rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and
poor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on
moving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.
Driving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge
closures.
