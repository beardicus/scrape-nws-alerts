* WHAT...For the Lake Wind Advisory, southwest winds 20 to 25 mph

Advisory, Greater Reno-Carson City-Minden Area.
* WHEN...For the Lake Wind Advisory, from noon today to 10 PM
PDT this evening. For the Wind Advisory, from 11 AM to 8 PM
PDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Small boats, kayaks and paddle boards will be prone to
capsizing and should remain off lake waters until conditions
improve. Gusty winds could blow around unsecured objects and
high profile vehicles. Tree limbs could be blown down and a few
power outages may result.</description>
<instruction>Now is the time to secure loose outdoor items such as patio
furniture, holiday decorations, and trash cans before winds
increase which could blow these items away. The best thing to do
is prepare ahead of time by making sure you have extra food and
water on hand, flashlights with spare batteries and/or candles in
the event of a power outage.
Check lake conditions before heading out and be prepared for a
sudden increase in winds and wave heights. Consider postponing
boating activities on the lake until a day with less wind.</instruction>
