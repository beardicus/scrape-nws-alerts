<headline>Wind Advisory issued June 11 at 9:23AM PDT until June 12 at 8:00PM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WIND ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM TO 8 PM PDT
SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Southwest winds 25 to 35 mph with gusts up to 60 mph
expected. Higher wind gusts possible in wind prone areas. Wave
heights of 2 to 4 feet on Lake Tahoe. Sierra ridge gusts between
80 and 110 mph.
* WHERE...Greater Lake Tahoe Area, Surprise Valley California,
Lassen-Eastern Plumas-Eastern Sierra Counties, Northern Washoe
County and Mono County.
* WHEN...From 11 AM to 8 PM PDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Small boats, kayaks and paddle boards will be prone to
capsizing and should remain off lake waters until conditions
improve. Gusty winds could blow around unsecured objects and
high profile vehicles. Tree limbs could be blown down and a few
power outages may result.</description>
<instruction>Now is the time to secure loose outdoor items such as patio
furniture, holiday decorations, and trash cans before winds
increase which could blow these items away. The best thing to do
is prepare ahead of time by making sure you have extra food and
water on hand, flashlights with spare batteries and/or candles in
the event of a power outage.
Check lake conditions before heading out and be prepared for a
sudden increase in winds and wave heights. Consider postponing
boating activities on the lake until a day with less wind.</instruction>
