<description>...HEAVY RAINFALL SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT PROMPTING RISING STREAMS
AND RIVERS IN THE JOHN DAY BASIN...
The combination of runoff and moderate to localized heavy rainfall
over the next 24 hours will promote rising streams and rivers
tomorrow into early next week. Rainfall amounts between a half inch
to one inch is anticipated over the John Day Basin Sunday and Sunday
night. Rises are expected on the John Day River at Service creek
with the possibility of minor flood stage being reached Monday
morning. Additional rises are also expected elsewhere along the John
Day and nearby streams and creeks where levels may approach bankfull
or rise above such as at the North Fork John Day River near Monument.
Additional outlooks, including possible warnings or advisories, may
be issued. Those with interests along rivers and streams should stay
tuned to the forecast and stay up to date with the latest river
levels.</description>
