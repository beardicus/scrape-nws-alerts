<headline>Lake Wind Advisory issued June 11 at 9:23AM PDT until June 11 at 10:00PM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>

* WHAT...For the Lake Wind Advisory, west winds 15 to 25 mph with
gusts up to 45 mph expected. Waves 2 to 4 feet on Pyramid. For

* WHERE...For the Lake Wind Advisory, Pyramid Lake, Lahontan

* WHEN...For the Lake Wind Advisory, from noon today to 10 PM
PDT this evening. For the Heat Advisory, from noon today to 8
PM PDT this evening. For the Wind Advisory, from 11 AM to 8 PM
PDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Small boats, kayaks and paddle boards will be prone to
capsizing and should remain off lake waters until conditions
improve. Gusty winds could blow around unsecured objects and
high profile vehicles. Tree limbs could be blown down and a few
power outages may result. Blowing dust downwind of dry lake beds
and sinks may reduce visibility. Hot temperatures may cause heat
illnesses to occur.</description>
<instruction>Now is the time to secure loose outdoor items such as patio
furniture, holiday decorations, and trash cans before winds
increase which could blow these items away. The best thing to do
is prepare ahead of time by making sure you have extra food and
water on hand, flashlights with spare batteries and/or candles in
the event of a power outage.
Check lake conditions before heading out and be prepared for a
sudden increase in winds and wave heights. Consider postponing
boating activities on the lake until a day with less wind.
Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.</instruction>
