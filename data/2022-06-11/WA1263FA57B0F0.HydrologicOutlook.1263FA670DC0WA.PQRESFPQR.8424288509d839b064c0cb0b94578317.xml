<description>...High flows on the Columbia River through at least the middle of
next week...
...A series of wet storm systems will result in rising rivers
across the Pacific Northwest over the next several days. As this
water feeds into the Columbia River, expect the Columbia River to
approach minor flood stage between Vancouver and Kelso late in the
weekend into early next week. The last time the Columbia River
hit minor flood stage was in the Spring of 2017. It also came a
few inches away in the Spring of 2019.
At this point, the Columbia River is forecast to fall short of
minor flood stage, but given unforeseen dam releases upstream can
happen, there remains some uncertainty in river levels over the
coming week. Either way, the impacts will be similar for most
recreational users. Those venturing in the river should be
prepared for cold water and unusually powerful currents. Boaters
should be aware that many objects typically exposed along the
sides of the river channel will now be below the water`s surface
and could damage their boat. A few paths along the river`s edge
may also become submerged. Residents impacted by the waters levels
in the Spring of 2017 should take precautions to protect their
property as well as continuing to monitor the latest forecast.
Finally, Interstate 5 bridge lifts are more frequent during
periods of high flows on the Columbia River.</description>
