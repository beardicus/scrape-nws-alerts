<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM TO 1 PM MDT SUNDAY...
The New Mexico Departments of Health and Environment has issued an
Air Quality Alert, from 6 AM to 1 PM MDT Sunday.
* WHAT... New Midnight Fire in Rio Arriba County is burning at the
edge of private lands in Potrero Canyon. Winds will be out of the
west-northwest today with sustained winds around 13 mph to possibly
cause smoke to drift into Taos County and further south. Smoke from
new fires in western areas of the state and the two largest fires
will tend to drift toward the southeast through the remainder of
the afternoon and evening. Light and more variable wind conditions
expected in the vicinity of the Black fire. Significant impacts
from new and residual smoke will be localized and in close
proximity to individual fires through Sunday morning. New fires
caused by recent lightning activity may also contribute additional
smoke to regional airsheds going into Sunday as hot and dry
conditions dominate.
* WHERE... Significant smoke impacts will be localized across
portions of Taos, northern Grant and western Sierra counties.
Elsewhere, brief moderate impacts are expected at times between the
Rio Grande Valley and Continental Divide but widespread unhealthy
conditions are not expected. More details and latest air quality
information can be found at https://fire.airnow.gov
* WHEN... Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1 PM MDT
Sunday, June 12th.</description>
