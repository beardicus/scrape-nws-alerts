<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT...
The following message is transmitted at the request of the New Mexico
Departments of Health and Environment, United States Forest Service
and the Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality Response Program.
* WHAT...New Midnight Fire in Rio Arriba County is burning at the edge
of private lands in Potrero Canyon. Winds will be out of the west-
northwest today with sustained winds around 13 mph to possibly cause
smoke to drift into Taos County and further south. Smoke from new
fires in western areas of the state and the two largest fires will
tend to drift toward the southeast through the remainder of the
afternoon and evening. Light and more variable wind conditions
expected in the vicinity of the Black Fire. Significant impacts from
new and residual smoke will be localized and in close proximity to
individual fires through Sunday morning. New fires caused by recent
lightning activity may also contribute additional smoke to regional
airsheds going into Sunday as hot and dry conditions dominate.
* WHERE...Significant smoke impacts will be localized across portions
of Taos, northern Grant, and western Sierra counties. Elsewhere,
brief moderate impacts are expected at times between the Rio Grande
Valley and Continental Divide, but widespread unhealthy conditions
are not expected. More details and latest air quality information
can be found at https://fire.airnow.gov.
* WHEN...This evening through at least 1 PM MDT Sunday, June 12th.
* IMPACTS...Those with conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and heart
disease will be especially vulnerable to impacts from poor air
quality, as will adults over age 65, young children, and pregnant
women if smoke concentrations become unhealthy.
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method available
at https://nmtracking.doh.nm.gov/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
https://nmtracking.doh.nm.gov/environment/air/IndoorQuality.html and
https://cv.nmhealth.org
New Mexicans will also need to take steps to keep their homes cool to
avoid heat-related illnesses. NMDOH offers tips here:
