<description>...SIGNIFICANT MOUNTAIN SNOW EXPECTED EARLY TO MID NEXT WEEK...
A series of Pacific storms associated with the next atmospheric
river event will impact eastern Utah and western Colorado early to
mid next week. Significant snow is expected in all of the
mountains with the heaviest amounts projected to fall in the
southern and central mountains. At this time, over a foot of snow
is possible in the northern ranges with projected accumulations in
the 3 to 4 foot range possible for the southern mountains. Mostly
rain will fall in the valleys early on in the event but, once
colder air moves in towards the midweek point, rain will turn to
snow for many valley locations. The northern valleys as well as
the southwest Colorado valleys may see several inches of snow with
locally higher amounts possible in the foothills of the San Juan
Mountains.
The main concern in the valleys, particularly early in the week
before the colder air arrives, will be the potential for localized
flooding due to runoff from impervious areas and/or rain on snow
which will enhance runoff rates from snowmelt.
In addition to the snow, gusty winds are expected over much of
the region as these systems move through, resulting in blowing
snow and significantly reduced visibilities at times. Travel,
especially over the mountain passes, will be difficult if not
impossible at times. Expect winter driving conditions with icy and
snow packed roads at higher elevations.
There is some uncertainty regarding if there will be any notable
break between these two systems, and the exact track of them both.
This will ultimately impact final snow totals. Those who are
planning to travel across eastern Utah and western Colorado,
especially in the mountains, should stay informed of the latest
weather forecast at weather.gov/gjt. You can find the latest road
conditions for Colorado at cotrip.org, or you can visit
udottraffic.utah.gov for conditions in Utah.</description>
