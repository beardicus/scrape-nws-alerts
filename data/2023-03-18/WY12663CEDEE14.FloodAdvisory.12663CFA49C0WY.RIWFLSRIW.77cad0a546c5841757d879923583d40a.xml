<headline>Flood Advisory issued March 18 at 1:01PM MDT  by NWS Riverton</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY FOR ICE JAMS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM MDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by ice jams.
* WHERE...A portion of north central Wyoming, including the
following county, Big Horn. Flooding is most likely to occur on
the Bighorn River from around Manderson to Greybull, and on the
Nowood River in Big Horn County.
* WHEN...Until 600 PM MDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
Some low-water crossings may become impassable. Agricultural land
adjacent to the rivers could become covered by flood waters.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1242 PM MDT, At 12 PM MDT Sunday, emergency management
reported ice in the Bighorn River between Manderson and
Greybull. Temperatures rising into the mid to upper 40s and
afternoon sunshine will aid low elevation snowmelt and add
additional water to the Bighorn and Nowood Rivers through
Monday afternoon. Any ice jams could quickly produce minor
flooding. Bridge supports and tight bends in the river are
the most likely locations for ice jams to begin. Water can
quickly accumulate behind the jam causing localized flooding.
- The Bighorn River from Manderson to Basin and north to
Greybull is the most likely place to experience minor
flooding. This flood advisory replaces the previous advisory
that had been in effect until 6 PM Saturday.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Low-lying areas between Manderson and Greybull.
