<description>...HAZARDOUS TRAVEL CONDITIONS POSSIBLE INTO THIS AFTERNOON FROM
BLOWING AND DRIFTING SNOW...
Gusty northwest winds will continue into the afternoon hours today
leading to blowing and drifting snow. The combination of the wind
and blowing snow will reduce visibilities, especially in
unsheltered areas and in open country. These conditions will also
lead to icy conditions on roads as the snow melts and re-freezes.
Motorists should be aware of the potentially quickly changing
conditions and should drive accordingly. Winds will subside by
late afternoon with improving conditions expected by this evening.
Unfortunately, another round of strong winds are expected to
develop across the downslope favored areas of the Prairie Coteau
late tonight into Sunday. This will lead to more blowing and
drifting snow, reduced visibilities and hazardous travel
conditions.</description>
