<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued March 18 at 4:13PM AKDT until March 20 at 10:00AM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY EVENING THROUGH
MONDAY MORNING FOR THE KUSKOKWIM COAST AND NUNIVAK ISLAND...
* WHAT...Snow and blowing snow expected. Total snow accumulations
of 1 to 3 inches possible. Southeast winds could gust as high
as 50 mph. Visibilities potentially reduced to one half mile or
less at times.
* WHERE...Kuskokwim Coast and Nunivak Island.
* WHEN...From Sunday evening through Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. Gusty winds could
bring down tree branches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A strong Bering low is expected to bring a
front into the Kuskokwim Delta on Monday. Winds gusting to as
high as 50 mph and light to moderate snow will promote a threat
for blowing snow with significantly reduced visibility down to
one half mile or less at times. The area of greatest threat
should stretch from Nunivak Island into Toksook Bay, and then
southward along the coast to Kipnuk. However, snow and blowing
snow may spread as far inland as Bethel through the morning
hours on Monday.</description>
