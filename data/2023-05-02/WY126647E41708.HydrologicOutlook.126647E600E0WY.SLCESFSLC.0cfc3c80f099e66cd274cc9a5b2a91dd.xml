<description>...RISES TO CREEKS, STREAMS, AND RIVERS DUE TO INCREASED
SNOWMELT...
Streams, creeks, and rivers will continue to experience
significant rises moving forward throughout the week, especially
low and mid elevation watersheds across the forecast area.
Waterways will be running high, fast, cold, and extremely
dangerous increasing the risk of hypothermia and drowning with
even brief periods of time in the water. Keep a safe distance from
these waterways as banks may become unstable, and especially
monitor children and pets closely as they can quickly drown in
these elevated flows.
Isolated flooding has occurred, and will continue to over the
several days. Many other mid-elevation watersheds will continue to
run high, fast, and cold with flows approaching, or remaining
near, bankfull conditions.
High pressure over the area will lead to continued temperatures
around 10 to 20 degrees above normal through midweek. Given record
snowpack in our area mountains, these temperatures will yield
continued snowmelt of low and mid-elevation basins, leading to the
high flows mentioned above. A low pressure system will move into
the region and bring cooler temperatures from Thursday on into the
weekend, resulting in decreased snowmelt.
Continue to monitor conditions closely as the spring snowmelt-
runoff has now begun in earnest. Stay tuned for the latest river
forecasts, watches, and warnings. Refer to those already issued
for additional information.</description>
