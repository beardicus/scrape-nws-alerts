<description>...Critical Fire Weather Conditions This Afternoon and Early
Evening for Parts of Southeast Minnesota and Northeast Iowa...
.Afternoon humidities are expected fall into the teens and lower 20s
across parts of northeast Iowa and southeast Minnesota this
afternoon. In addition, there will be sustained northwest winds of
15 to 25 mph with winds gusts of 25 to 35 mph. While fuels are
starting to green-up, there is still plenty of dead grasses around
from last year`s growing season to support fires which could spread
quickly if ignited. These conditions are expected to produce
critical fire weather conditions; therefore, the Fire Weather
Watch will be upgraded to a Red Flag Warning for this afternoon
and early evening.
