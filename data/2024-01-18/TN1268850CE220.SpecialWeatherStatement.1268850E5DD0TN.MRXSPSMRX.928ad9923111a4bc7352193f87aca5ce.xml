<description>...DANGEROUS ROAD CONDITIONS EXPECTED THIS MORNING DUE TO BLACK
ICE AND LOCALIZED LIGHT ICE ACCUMULATION POSSIBLE TONIGHT...
Numerous roads across the Tennessee Valley and Southern
Appalachians remain snow and ice covered from the recent winter
storm. Any melted snow and ice will have re-frozen this morning,
especially on untreated secondary and rural roads as well as
bridges and overpasses.
Additionally, black ice will be a major concern this morning as
any wet pavement refreezes. Black ice is difficult to see on
roads and can result in slick spots. Use caution, slow down, and
remain alert if traveling this morning. Please check local road
conditions first before traveling this morning.
Areas of rain and freezing rain will approach the region tonight.
While widespread freezing rain and ice accumulation is not
expected across Bradley and Polk Counties, localized icy spots may
develop in sheltered valleys, low spots in hilly terrain, and
locations near the McMinn County line. Please continue to monitor
the forecast for the latest information.</description>
