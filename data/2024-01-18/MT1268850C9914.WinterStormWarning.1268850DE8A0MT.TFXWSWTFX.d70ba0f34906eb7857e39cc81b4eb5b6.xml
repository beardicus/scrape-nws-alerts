...WIND CHILL ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM MST THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...For the Winter Storm Warning, snow diminishing by late this
morning. Additional snow accumulations up to two inches. Winds
gusting as high as 40 mph will create significant blowing and

snow could significantly reduce visibility and has resulted in
some road closures. The dangerously cold wind chills could cause
frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow diminishes this morning, but gusty winds
will create significant drifting and blowing snow hazards over
mountain passes.</description>
