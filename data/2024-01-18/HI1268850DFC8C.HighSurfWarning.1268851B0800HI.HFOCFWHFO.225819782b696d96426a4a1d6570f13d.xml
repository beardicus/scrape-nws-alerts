<headline>High Surf Warning issued January 18 at 8:51AM HST until January 18 at 6:00PM HST by NWS Honolulu</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF WARNING FOR NORTH FACING SHORES OF NIIHAU KAUAI OAHU
MOLOKAI MAUI AND FOR WEST FACING SHORES OF KAUAI OAHU MOLOKAI
HAS BEEN CANCELLED...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT FOR NORTH FACING SHORES OF
NIIHAU KAUAI OAHU MOLOKAI MAUI AND FOR WEST FACING SHORES OF KAUAI
OAHU MOLOKAI AND LANAI UNTIL 6 PM HST...
...HIGH SURF WARNING FOR WEST FACING SHORES OF BIG ISLAND STILL
IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM HST....
.A moderate size, medium period west northwest swell peaked
earlier this morning and has rapidly fallen the past few hours.
Thus, the High Surf Warning (HSW) has been downgraded to a High
Surf Advisory (HSA) for most smaller island north and west-facing
shores through today. There has been a significant enough westerly
component to this swell to maintain warning level surf along
various points of the leeward Big Island kona coastline.
...HIGH SURF WARNING IN EFFECT FOR WEST FACING SHORES OF BIG
ISLAND UNTIL 6 PM HST...
* WHAT...Surf heights 10 to 14 feet.
* WHERE..West facing shores of Big Island.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM HST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...High. Expect very strong breaking waves and powerful
currents. Waves breaking in channel entrances may make
navigating the channels dangerous.</description>
<instruction>Stay away from the shoreline along the affected coasts. Be
prepared for road closures. Postpone entering or leaving channels
affected by the high surf until the surf subsides.</instruction>
