<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 18 at 4:41AM EST until January 20 at 1:00AM EST by NWS Chicago</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 10 PM THIS EVENING TO NOON
CST FRIDAY...
...WINTER STORM WATCH NOW IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
FRIDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Winter Storm Warning, locally very heavy lake
effect snow expected. Total snow accumulations in excess of 6
inches likely in northeastern Porter County with isolated
totals of a foot or more possible. For southwestern Porter
County, light snow tonight will deposit 2 to 4 inches of snow.
Winds gusting as high as 40 mph are expected near the lake and
up to 30 mph inland, leading to blowing and drifting snow. For
the Winter Storm Watch, heavy lake effect snow possible if the
band remains over Porter County or moves back into the county.
* WHERE...Porter County, particularly northeast Porter County for
the warning-level impacts.
* WHEN...For the Winter Storm Warning, from 10 PM this evening
to noon CST Friday. For the Winter Storm Watch, from Friday
afternoon through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...For northeast Porter County, travel is expected to
become extremely dangerous, if not impossible in spots late
tonight into Friday morning under the most intense lake effect
band. Snowfall rates in this band of 2 to possibly over 3 inches
per hour are likely. This, combined with wind gusts to 40 mph,
will lead to pure whiteout conditions. Unnecessary travel should
be avoided over northeast Porter County late tonight and Friday
morning. For southwest Porter County, accumulating light snow
along with blowing and drifting snow will result in hazardous
travel late this evening through Friday morning.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Due to the nature of lake effect snow,
conditions can vary significantly over very short distances,
going from just flurries to white out conditions over the span
of just a few miles. This can also result in highly variable
snowfall totals over short distances.</description>
