<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 18 at 3:19PM EST until January 19 at 1:00PM EST by NWS Chicago</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM THIS
EVENING TO NOON CST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Lake effect snow possible. Total snow
accumulations of 2 to 4 inches. Additional lake effect snow
accumulations of 1 to 3 inches possible in northeast Lake
County.
* WHERE...Lake County, IN.
* WHEN...From 6 PM CST this evening to noon CST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on hazardous travel conditions. Areas of blowing
and drifting snow also develop late tonight and persist through
Friday morning. This will significantly reduce visibility and
result in snow covered roads, especially in open areas. The
hazardous conditions likely impact the morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The dominant lake effect snow band is
expected to remain mainly east of Lake County. If the band ends
up further west than currently forecast, heavy snowfall rates in
excess of 2 inches per hour could result in a period of
dangerous travel conditions in northeast Lake County early
Friday morning.</description>
