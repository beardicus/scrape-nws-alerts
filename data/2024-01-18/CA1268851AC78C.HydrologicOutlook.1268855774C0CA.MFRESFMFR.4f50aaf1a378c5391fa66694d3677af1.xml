<headline>Hydrologic Outlook issued January 18 at 6:35PM PST  by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...Flood Potential Outlook for snow melt flooding, quick rises of
streams and creeks to near bankfull, and ponding of low-lying areas
as well as poorly draining urban areas... in the following counties:
In California...Siskiyou and in Oregon...Coos...Curry...
Douglas...Jackson...Josephine...
A long duration atmospheric river event is forecast to bring 1 to
5 inches of rain to the region from Friday night through Monday
morning. Rainfall amounts are expected to be highest in
southwestern Siskiyou, Josephine and Curry County. However,
excessive rainfall with snow levels consistently around 6000 feet
and melting snow pack, raises the risk for more widespread
flooding. As well as flooding concerns, this rainfall could also
lead to increased occurrences of rockfall and localized land
slides.
A flood potential outlook is issued when there is the potential for
significant rises or flooding along rivers and streams. The exact
scenario for flooding remains uncertain. This product will be
updated as necessary. Watches and warnings may be issued by the
National Weather Service if this situation worsens.</description>
