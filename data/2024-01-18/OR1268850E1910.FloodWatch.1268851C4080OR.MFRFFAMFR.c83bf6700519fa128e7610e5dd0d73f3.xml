<headline>Flood Watch issued January 18 at 11:24AM PST until January 19 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>.A long duration atmospheric river event is forecast to bring 2 to 5
inches of rain to the region from Friday night through Monday
morning.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY MORNING, JANUARY 20 THROUGH
MONDAY MORNING, JANUARY 22...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of southwest Oregon including the Curry County
Coast. This is roughly from port Orford south to the California
state line.
* WHEN...From Saturday morning through Monday, January 29.
* IMPACTS...Area creeks and streams are running high and could flood
with more heavy rain. Flooding may occur in poorly draining
low-lying areas and urban areas. Low-water crossings may be
flooded. As well as flooding concerns, this rainfall could also
lead to increased occurrences of rockfalls and land slides.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Excessive rainfall on already saturated soils, leading to
increased runoff into already high creeks, streams, and
rivers.
