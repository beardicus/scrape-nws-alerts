<description>...FLASH FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL FURTHER
NOTICE...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by the sudden shifting or break up of
an ice jam continues to be possible.
* WHERE...The lower Kankakee River from near Wilmington downstream
to the confluence with the Illinois River, including portions of
Grundy and Will counties.
* WHEN...Until further notice.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous ice flows or shifting of ice may damage
structures along the shore. Additional roads and streets may be
flooded. Localized water level fluctuations possible due to an ice
jam.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A significant ice jam is located on the Kankakee River near
the confluence with the Illinois River to just upstream of
Wilmington. The ice jam is holding back a significant amount
of water. Continued cold weather has likely begun to freeze
the ice jam in place, which reduces the risk of downstream
flooding over the next few days. Sudden shifting or breaking
may still be possible, which could cause new flooding with
limited advanced notice. The risk of breaking and shifting of
this ice jam may again increase by next week due to warmer
temperatures.

<instruction>A Flood Watch means flooding is possible, but not yet certain, based
upon the latest forecasts. Persons with interests along area rivers,
creeks, and other waterways should monitor the latest forecasts and
be prepared to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
