<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 18 at 3:19PM EST until January 19 at 1:00PM EST by NWS Chicago</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 10 PM THIS EVENING
TO NOON CST FRIDAY...
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH FRIDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Winter Storm Warning, locally very heavy lake
effect snow expected. Total snow accumulations in excess of 8
inches expected in northern Porter County with isolated totals
in excess of 12 inches likely in northeast Porter County. For
southwestern Porter County, snow tonight with 2 to 4 inches of
snow expected. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph are expected near
the lake and up to 30 mph inland, leading to blowing and
drifting snow. For the Winter Storm Watch, very heavy lake
effect snow remains possible, if the band either remains over or
moves back into Porter County.
* WHERE...Porter County, particularly northeast Porter County.
* WHEN...For the Winter Storm Warning, from 10 PM this evening
to noon CST Friday. For the Winter Storm Watch, from Friday
afternoon through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...For northeast Porter County, travel is expected to
become extremely dangerous, if not impossible in spots late
tonight into Friday morning under the most intense lake effect
band. Peak snowfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour are likely.
This, combined with wind gusts to 40 mph, will lead to periods
of whiteout conditions. Unnecessary travel should be avoided
over northeast Porter County late tonight and Friday morning.
For southwest Porter County, accumulating snow along with
blowing and drifting snow will result in hazardous travel late
this evening through Friday morning.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Due to the nature of lake effect snow,
conditions can vary significantly over very short distances,
going from just flurries to white out conditions over the span
of just a few miles. This can also result in highly variable
snowfall totals over short distances.</description>
