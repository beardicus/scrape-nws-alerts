<instruction>Even light snowfall causes major travel delays, especially during
periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to reach
your destination. Leave extra space between vehicles since it takes
longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions for the state you are calling from can be
obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
