<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 18 at 11:00AM EST until January 19 at 1:00PM EST by NWS Chicago</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 10 PM THIS EVENING
TO NOON CST FRIDAY...
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH FRIDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Winter Storm Warning, locally very heavy lake
effect snow expected. Total snow accumulations in excess of 6
inches expected in northern Porter County with isolated totals
of a foot or more likely in northeast Porter County. For
southwestern Porter County, light snow tonight with 2 to 4
inches of snow expected. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph are
expected near the lake and up to 30 mph inland, leading to
blowing and drifting snow. For the Winter Storm Watch, heavy
lake effect snow possible if the band remains over Porter County
or moves back into the county.
* WHERE...Porter County, particularly northeast Porter County
for the warning-level impacts.
* WHEN...For the Winter Storm Warning, from 10 PM this evening
to noon CST Friday. For the Winter Storm Watch, from Friday
afternoon through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...For northeast Porter County, travel is expected to
become extremely dangerous, if not impossible in spots late
tonight into Friday morning under the most intense lake effect
band. Snowfall rates in this band of 2 to possibly over 3
inches per hour are likely. This, combined with wind gusts to
40 mph, will lead to pure whiteout conditions. Unnecessary
travel should be avoided over northeast Porter County late
tonight and Friday morning. For southwest Porter County,
accumulating light snow along with blowing and drifting snow
will result in hazardous travel late this evening through
Friday morning.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Due to the nature of lake effect snow,
conditions can vary significantly over very short distances,
going from just flurries to white out conditions over the span
of just a few miles. This can also result in highly variable
snowfall totals over short distances.</description>
