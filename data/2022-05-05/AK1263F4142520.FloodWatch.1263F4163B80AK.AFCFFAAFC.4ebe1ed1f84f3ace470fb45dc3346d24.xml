<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY
EVENING ALONG THE KUSKOKWIM RIVER FROM STONY RIVER TO CROOKED
CREEK...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam is possible.
* WHERE...Kuskokwim River from Stony River to Crooked Creek.
* WHEN...Through Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks.
Ice jam flooding has high uncertainty. Impacts could range between
localized high water and severe flooding. Now is the time to take
precautions. Where possible, move items to higher ground and prepare
your community for possible flooding.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- There are 20 plus miles of firm ice in place along the
Kuskokwim River between Crooked Creek and Napaimute.
Tributaries between Stony River and Crooked Creek are opening
up and adding water to the Kuskokwim River, which is causing
moving ice and bankful conditions.
An ice jam downstream of Crooked Creek near Rabbit Island
remains in place. Water levels continue to steadily rise and
will continue to rise until the ice jam releases.
An ice jam has also formed along the Kuskokwim River below
the community of Stony River. The Stony River feeding into
the Kuskokwim River is above flood stage. Should ice from
upstream of Stony River begin to move, it likely would result
in ice jam flooding in the community of Stony River.
