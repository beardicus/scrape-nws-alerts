<description>...FLOOD WATCH NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Arkansas and Oklahoma, including the following
counties, in Arkansas, Benton, Carroll, Crawford, Franklin,
Madison, Sebastian and Washington AR. In Oklahoma, Adair,
Cherokee, Choctaw, Craig, Creek, Delaware, Haskell, Latimer, Le
Flore, Mayes, McIntosh, Muskogee, Nowata, Okfuskee, Okmulgee,
Osage, Ottawa, Pawnee, Pittsburg, Pushmataha, Rogers, Sequoyah,
Tulsa, Wagoner and Washington OK.
* WHEN...Through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Significant and potentially life threatening flash
flooding is ongoing just south of I-44 across Okfuskee and
Okmulgee counties. Numerous main-stem rivers will likely rise
above flooding. Extensive low land flooding will be likely,
especially where the heavier rain has already occurred. Many
low-water crossings will likely become flooded. Area creeks and
streams are already running high.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Widespread heavy rainfall has fallen over the past 24 hours
across much of northeast Oklahoma and far northwest Arkansas.
Heavy rains will continue to spread east and southward
through the morning. Additional showers and storms are likely
to develop through the day Thursday. Any locally heavy
amounts could lead to rapid onset flooding. Rains will taper
off by late afternoon from west to east.
