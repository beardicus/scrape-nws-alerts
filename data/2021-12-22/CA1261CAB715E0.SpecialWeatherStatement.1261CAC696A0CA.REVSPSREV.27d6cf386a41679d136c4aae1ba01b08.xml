<description>...WINTER WEATHER WILL RESULT IN MAJOR TRAVEL DISRUPTIONS THROUGH
THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND...
A series of systems will continue to bring stormy weather to the
Sierra, northeast California, and western Nevada. There may be a
period with lighter snowfall for the Sierra Friday afternoon
before heavy snowfall returns on Christmas Day. However, travel is
likely to remain very slow with snow-covered roads and chain
requirements quite possible.
*  Sierra and northeast CA - Winter advisories and warnings are in
place... please check those for details.
*  Western Nevada - Widespread spillover precipitation is possible
by Thursday morning. However, snow levels are not forecast to
drop to valley floors until Friday morning so any impacts look
limited to higher foothills and ranges above 6000-6500 feet.
Accumulating snow will then be likely by Friday morning across
lower elevations of western Nevada as a colder system moves
into the region. The chance for snow and travel headaches will
continue through the remainder of the weekend.
*  Consider alternate routes or adjusting plans if you are
traveling for the holidays. This is especially true if you`re
heading into or out of any Sierra locations where chain
controls, long delays, and potential road closures may occur.
Monitor the latest weather forecast (weather.gov/reno) and
check road conditions routinely (511 for Nevada and
1-800-427-7623 for California) or download the mobile
applications NVRoads (Nevada) and Quickmap (California).</description>
