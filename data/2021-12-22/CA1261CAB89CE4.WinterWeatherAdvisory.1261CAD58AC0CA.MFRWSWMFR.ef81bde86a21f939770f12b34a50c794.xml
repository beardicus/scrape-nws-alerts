FRIDAY...

inches likely. Wind gusts from the southwest at 30 to 50 mph are
possible, at times, leading to blowing and drifting snow,
mainly in exposed areas.
* WHERE...In Modoc County, California, portions of Highway 139
between Canby and Adin, portions of Highway 299 at and near
Cedar Pass, and a portion of Highway 395 between Davis Creek
and Willow Ranch. In Oregon, portions of Highway 97 from

* WHEN...From 4 PM Wednesday to 4 AM PST Friday. The heaviest
snowfall is most likely to occur between 9 PM PST and 7 AM PST
Thursday morning.

conditions could impact the Thursday morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Additional snowfall with lower snow
levels is likely between the 24th and the 30th of December. Be
sure to check for additional details as that time frame nears
because travel is likely to be significantly affected by
