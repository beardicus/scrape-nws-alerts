<description>...An area of heavy snow showers will affect northeastern Aroostook
County...
At 447 PM EST...An area of heavy snow showers was along a line
extending from near Loring to near Houlton. Heavy snow showers are
expected to continue in this area through 8 p.m.
Locations impacted include...
Presque Isle, Caribou, Houlton, Fort Fairfield, Limestone, Van Buren,
Mapleton, Washburn, Mars Hill, Hodgdon, Ashland, Easton, Woodland,
Bridgewater, Smyrna, Masardis, Dudley Township, Smyrna Mills, Loring
and Madawaska Lake.
This includes the following highways...
Interstate 95 between mile markers 286 and 302.
US Highway 1 between Houlton and Caribou.
State Highway 11 near Knowles Corner.
* Visibilities will drop quickly to less than a half mile in this
area of heavy snow showers.
* Sudden and brief snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour are
possible in this area of heavy snow showers.
Travel is not advised during these heavy snow showers. Rapid
visibility reduction and potentially icy roads are likely to lead to
accidents. Consider delaying travel until the snow showers pass your
location. If traveling pull off to a safe location.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time when traveling.</description>
