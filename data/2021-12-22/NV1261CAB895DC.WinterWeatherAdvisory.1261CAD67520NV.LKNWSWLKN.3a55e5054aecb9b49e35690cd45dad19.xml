<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 22 at 2:23PM PST until December 24 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Elko</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM THURSDAY TO 10 AM
PST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 6 inches.
Very low chance for freezing rain of less than 0.1 of an inch.
Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...Southwest Elko County.
* WHEN...Late Thursday morning through Friday morning.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery to icy road conditions. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute and Christmas travel.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Lamoille Summit is the area most likely to
see the higher snow amounts. Freezing rain remains an outside
chance but if it occurs will rapidly cause icy conditions. Elko
proper would be the area to see this low chance of freezing
rain. What is likely is the winter precipitation will lead to
travel impacts just ahead of the Christmas weekend.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
The latest road conditions for the state you are calling from can
