<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued December 22 at 4:32AM PST until December 27 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM MIDDAY FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY
MORNING ABOVE 1500 FEET...
* WHAT...Periods of moderate to heavy snowfall is possible, mainly
above 1500 foot elevations. Total snow accumulations of several
inches at lower elevations to as much as a few feet near 3500
foot elevations are possible.
* WHERE...Central Douglas County, Eastern Curry County and
Josephine County, Eastern Douglas County Foothills and Jackson
County including portions of Interstate 5 between Grants Pass
and Tri-City, portions of Highway 199 in the Illinois Valley,
portions of the Tiller Highway from near Tiller to Shady Cove,
portions of Highway 138 east of Roseburg, portions of Highway 62
from Shady Cove to Prospect, much of the Applegate Valley,
Jacksonville, from east Medford south to the Ashland area in
the Rogue Valley, and Highway 140 east of White City.
* WHEN...From Friday morning through Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be difficult to impossible, at times,
during this time period. The hazardous conditions could impact
the morning or evening commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow levels on Christmas Eve day are likely
to be between 1500 and 2500 feet. Cold low pressure moving
through the area Christmas Eve into Christmas Day is likely to
lead to locally intense showers resulting in accumulations, at
times. Additional waves of low pressure and a cooling air mass
are then likely to bring additional periods of snow on the 26th
and 27th, possibly down to 500 to 1000 foot elevations, at times.

<instruction>* Stock emergency kit with tire chains, flashlight, batteries,
blankets, food, water, and medications.
* The safest place during a winter storm is indoors.
* Plan now to avoid traveling during the storm.
* A Winter Storm Watch means there is potential for significant
snow accumulations that may create dangerous travel.</instruction>
