<description>...NEAR CRITICAL TO CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS ON TUESDAY...
.Min RH values will be in the single digits to lower teens on
Tuesday as an upper level system approaches from the west. Winds

dry and moderately unstable air, in addition to above normal
temperatures, will lead to critical fire weather on Tuesday
afternoon. The worst conditions will likely be west of the Rio
Grande, along with portions of the Sacramento mountains.
