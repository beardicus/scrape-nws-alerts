<description>...Light Snow Accumulations Expected Through the Morning Hours...
A band of light snow extending from northwest North Carolina into
southwest Virginia and west central Virginia was continuing to
drift slowly east. Snow accumulations of around an inch are common
within this band of precipitation with a few spots across eastern
West Virginia seeing amounts closer to 2 inches this morning.
Temperatures have fallen below freezing in areas where the snow
has been falling with most areas in the upper 20s to lower 30s.
Untreated roads and sidewalks will become slick and hazardous.
Although these snow accumulations fall short of typical Winter
Weather Advisory levels, travel across this region this morning is
discouraged. If you must travel through the morning hours today,
reduce speed and drive slower than normal, allow extra time to
reach your destination, leave extra distance between you and the
vehicle in front of you. Avoid sudden breaking and accelerating
and use extreme caution while traveling in more mountainous
terrain.
Note, a Winter Weather Advisory remains in effect for area further
east and north from Blacksburg to Roanoke and north of Lynchburg.
The heaviest snowfall is expected to occur in the Southern
Shenandoah Valley from Lexington northward near the Interstate 81
corridor.
If conditions become worse than expected at this time, a Winter
Weather Advisory may be needed for other parts of the forecast
area. Stay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio or visit our web site at
www.weather.gov/blacksburg for further weather information.</description>
