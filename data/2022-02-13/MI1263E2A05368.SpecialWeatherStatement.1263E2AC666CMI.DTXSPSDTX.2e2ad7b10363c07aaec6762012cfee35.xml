<description>...BANDS OF SNOW FROM LAKE HURON DURING LATE AFTERNOON CONTINUES
THROUGH EARLY EVENING...
WEATHER...
* Bands of snow moving inland from Lake Huron will be heavy at
times leading to reduced visibility and snow cover on untreated
roads.
* Snow showers continue across the eastern half of Huron county
and move into northeast Sanilac county by 6 PM. Activity
persists in these areas through 8 PM and then moves offshore
during mid to late evening.
* Snow accumulation up to 2 inches is expected mainly along and
east of M-53 and M-19 between 5 PM and 8 PM.
IMPACTS...
* Accumulating snow will lead to slick conditions on untreated
roads particularly on bridges, exit ramps and overpasses.
* Bursts of heavier snow will reduce visibility for motorists
with wide variations over short distances.
&amp;&amp;
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
* Motorists are urged to use caution and account for the variable
driving conditions by traveling and slower speed and allowing
extra time.
* Prepare, plan and stay informed. Visit http://go.usa.gov/c7kkP</description>
