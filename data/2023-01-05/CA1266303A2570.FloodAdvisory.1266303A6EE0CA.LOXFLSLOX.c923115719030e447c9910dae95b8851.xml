MORNING...
* WHAT...Urban and small stream flooding caused by moderate to heavy
rainfall.
* WHERE...eastern Santa Barbara.
* WHEN...Until 230 AM PST.
* IMPACTS...Heavy rainfall could trigger shallow debris flows in and
near recent burn scars. Minor flooding of urban, low-lying, and
poor drainage areas, especially in Isla Vista, and the West Beach

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1209 AM PST, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated moderate to heavy rainfall moving into the eastern
Santa Barbara County from the west. This will cause urban and
small stream flooding and flooding of low-lying areas across
the advisory area. Rainfall rates between 0.33 and 0.50 inch
per hour are possible with this band of rainfall. Local
rainfall rates up to 1 inch per hour could occur, especially
along the south facing slopes of the Santa Ynez Range.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Santa Barbara, Montecito, Carpinteria, Isla Vista,
Summerland, Goleta, Highway 154 over San Marcos Pass, Lake
Cachuma.

<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas only if it is safe to do so.
The rain will likely trigger shallow mud and debris flows, minor
rock falls, and flooding capable of localized damage, especially in
steep terrain in and near burn scars.
Do not drive on flooded roads. Turn around, don`t drown when
encountering flooded roads. Most flood deaths occur in vehicles. Be
especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
