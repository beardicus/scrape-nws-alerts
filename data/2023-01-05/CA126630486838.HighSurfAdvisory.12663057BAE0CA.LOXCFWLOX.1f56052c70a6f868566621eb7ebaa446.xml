<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM PST
FRIDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM PST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Large breaking waves of 8 to 12 feet through Friday

Barbara County Southeastern Coast.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 1 PM PST Friday.
For the High Surf Advisory, until 6 PM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...There is an increased risk for ocean drowning. Rip
currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Large
breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and
rocks, and capsize small boats near shore. Flooding of sea
water is possible around the time of high tide, over
vulnerable low- lying coastal areas such as parking lots,
beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to roads or
structures is NOT expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The high tides will be near 6.0 feet
between 8 AM to 830 AM PST.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
