<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued January 05 at 5:20AM PST until January 05 at 11:00AM PST by NWS Eureka</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM PST FRIDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 AM PST THIS
MORNING...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking
waves around 30 feet. For the Coastal Flood Warning, high
astronomical tides along with high surf will cause minor
flooding in low-lying areas along the North Coast, with major
flooding possible in locations with exposure to surf. Up to one
half foot of saltwater inundation above ground level is possible
in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...Coastal Del Norte, Northern Humboldt Coast,
Southwestern Humboldt and Mendocino Coast Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Warning, from 3 AM Thursday to 6 AM
Friday. For the Coastal Flood Warning, from during high tide from 8
AM to 11 AM Thursday. High tide is between 9 and 10 AM between
Arena Cove and Crescent City. Saltwater inundation will be possible
1 to 2 hours before and after high tide.
* IMPACTS...Low-lying areas will experience minor flooding
including, but not limited to, roadways in King Salmon and the
Arcata bottoms, sections of Highway 1 on the Mendocino coast and
101 near South Beach in Del Norte, along with portions of New
Navy Base Rd on the North Spit of Humboldt Bay and Centerville
Rd. Breaking waves can sweep people off jetties and docks, and
into dangerous seas. Life- threatening surfing conditions and
significant beach erosion can be expected.</description>
<instruction>A Coastal Flood Warning means that flooding is occurring or
imminent. Coastal residents in the warned area should be alert
for rising water, and take appropriate action to protect life and
property.
Feet Above Ground is locally defined as feet above the Highest
Astronomical Tide or HAT.
Large breaking waves along the coast will lead to increased wave
run-up on beaches with waves topping and washing over large rocks
and jetties. These large waves can be erratic and unpredictable.
Use extra caution near the surf zone as these large waves will be
capable of sweeping people into the frigid and turbulent ocean
water. Mariners traversing the bar are urged to exercise extreme
caution or stay in port until the threat subsides. Please contact
the U.S. Coast Guard for information regarding harbor and bar
closures.</instruction>
