<description>...WINTRY PRECIPITATION TO MAKE FOR SLIPPERY TRAVEL IN SPOTS TODAY...
.Low pressure will gradually move south of the Gulf of Maine today.
Cold air will filter in from the north changing rain over to a
light, perhaps intermittent, mix of freezing drizzle, sleet, and
snow. It will not add up to much but will make for slippery travel
at times. The western Maine mountains will pick up 3 to 6 inches of
snow.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM EST THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation. Additional snow and sleet
accumulations up to one inch and ice accumulations around one
tenth of an inch. Winds gusting as high as 20 mph.
* WHERE...In Maine, Southern Oxford County. In New Hampshire,
Northern Carroll, Northern Grafton, and Southern Coos Counties.
* WHEN...Until 5 PM EST this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...A period of mixed precipitation is expected today with
air temperatures trending below freezing. Expect slippery road
conditions and avoid travel if possible.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling. The latest road
conditions can be obtained by going to newengland511.org</instruction>
