<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM PST THIS
AFTERNOON...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM THIS AFTERNOON
TO 5 AM PST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding
expected. For the High Surf Advisory, large waves expected in
the surf zone.
* WHERE...North Coast and Central Coast zones.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 8 AM this morning
to 1 PM PST this afternoon. For the High Surf Advisory, from 2
PM this afternoon to 5 AM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Tidal overflow around high tide may cause flooding
of lots, parks, and roads with only isolated road closures
expected. High surf will create large waves that can wash over
beaches, jetties, and other structures unexpectedly. People
can be swept off rocks and jetties and drown while observing
high surf. Minor beach erosion may damage coastal properties
and buildings.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.</instruction>
