<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued January 05 at 2:19PM PST until January 06 at 1:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST FRIDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM PST
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking
waves of 16 to 22 feet with dangerous rip currents. Sets up to
25 feet will be possible during the highest surf. For the
Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding.
* WHERE...San Luis Obispo County Beaches and Santa Barbara
County Central Coast Beaches.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Warning, until 10 AM PST Friday. For
the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 1 PM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely, around the time of
high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as
parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to
roads or structures is NOT expected. Powerful waves and strong
rip currents will pose an exceptional risk of ocean drowning
and damage to coastal structures like piers and jetties. Large
breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and
rocks, and capsize small boats near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The high tides will be near 5.8 feet
between 8 AM to 9 AM PST.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other water side
infrastructure.</instruction>
