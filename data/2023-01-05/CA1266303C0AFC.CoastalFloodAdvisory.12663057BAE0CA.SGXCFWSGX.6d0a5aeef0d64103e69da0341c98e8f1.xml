...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM PST
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking
waves of 10 to 16 feet. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor
coastal flooding expected.
* WHERE...San Diego County Coastal Areas.
* WHEN...From noon today to 6 PM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with isolated
road closures expected. Breaking waves can sweep people off
jetties and docks, and into dangerous seas. Life-threatening
swimming conditions and significant beach erosion can be
expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A westerly swell of 10 to 13 feet and a
period of 16 to 19 seconds from 270 degrees will produce very
high surf. The surf will steadily increase today to around 10
feet, then increase to as high as 16 feet tonight through
Friday morning. This should be a short-lived event as the surf
will subside late Friday.
Also, the following are the high tides for La Jolla:
Today: 3.5 feet at 09:39 PM. Friday: 5.9 feet at 808 AM.
Friday morning will be the time when coastal flooding is most likely.</description>

surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other waterside
infrastructure.</instruction>
