<headline>Flood Advisory issued January 05 at 1:08AM PST  by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM PST EARLY THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Urban and small stream flooding caused by moderate to heavy
rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Los Angeles County, excluding the Antelope Valley portion.
* WHEN...Until 400 AM PST.
* IMPACTS...Heavy rainfall could trigger shallow debris flows in and
near recent wildfire burn scars. Minor flooding in low-lying and
poor drainage areas. Ponding of water in urban or other areas is
occurring or is imminent.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 102 AM PST, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated moderate to heavy rainfall moving into the eastern
Santa Barbara County from the west. This will cause urban and
small stream flooding and flooding of low-lying areas across
the advisory area. Rainfall rates between 0.33 and 0.50 inch
per hour are possible with this band of rainfall.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Woodland Hills, Long Beach, Malibu, Burbank, Universal City,
Hollywood, Downtown Los Angeles, Pasadena, Van Nuys, Culver
City, Mount Wilson, Northridge, and Santa Monica.
- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood</description>
<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas only if it is safe to do so.
The rain will likely trigger shallow mud and debris flows, minor
rock falls, and flooding capable of localized damage, especially in
steep terrain in and near burn scars.
Do not drive on flooded roads. Turn around, don`t drown when
encountering flooded roads. Most flood deaths occur in vehicles. Be
especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
