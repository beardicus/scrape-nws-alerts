<headline>Flood Watch issued January 05 at 2:53AM PST until January 06 at 3:00AM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible within
the entire Watch area. Areas of most concern include the Alisal
burn scar, urban roads and freeways, and in creeks and streams.
* WHERE...All of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties,
including the Alisal burn scar.
* WHEN...Through this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Significant flash flooding is possible anywhere. This
includes mud and debris flows in and below the Alisal burn scar.
Urban areas should expect significant flooding of some roads and
freeways, with major delays or closures. Excessive runoff will
result in flooding of creeks and streams. While the risk of main
stem river flooding is low, water flowing through normally dry
rivers and washes will threaten homeless encampments.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A strong Pacific storm system will continue to bring periods
of heavy rainfall and scattered thunderstorms to the watch
area today.  Rainfall rates up to around an inch per hour are
possible.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding, including the
Alisal burn scar, should be prepared to take action should flooding
develop or evacuations are ordered.</instruction>
