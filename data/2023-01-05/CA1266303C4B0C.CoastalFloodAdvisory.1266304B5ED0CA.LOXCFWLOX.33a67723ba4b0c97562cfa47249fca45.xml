<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued January 05 at 2:19PM PST until January 06 at 1:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM PST
FRIDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM PST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Large breaking waves of 8 to 12 feet with dangerous rip
currents. Local sets up to 15 feet will be possible during the
highest surf.

Barbara County Southeastern Coast.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 1 PM PST Friday.
For the High Surf Advisory, until 6 PM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...There is an increased risk for ocean drowning. Rip
currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Large
breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and
rocks, and capsize small boats near shore. Flooding of sea water
is possible around the time of high tide, over vulnerable low-
lying coastal areas such as parking lots, beaches, and walkways.
Significant damage to roads or structures is NOT expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The high tides will be near 6.0 feet
between 8 AM to 830 AM PST.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
