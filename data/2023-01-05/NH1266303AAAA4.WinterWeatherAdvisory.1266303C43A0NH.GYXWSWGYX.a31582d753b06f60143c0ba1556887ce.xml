<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 05 at 6:53AM EST until January 05 at 5:00PM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...WINTRY PRECIPITATION TO MAKE FOR SLIPPERY TRAVEL IN SPOTS TODAY...
.Low pressure will gradually move south of the Gulf of Maine today.
Cold air will filter in from the north changing rain over to a
light, perhaps intermittent, mix of freezing drizzle, sleet, and
snow. It will not add up to much but will make for slippery travel
at times. The western Maine mountains will pick up 3 to 6 inches of
snow.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM EST THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation. Additional snow and sleet
accumulations of 2 to 4 inches for a storm total of 3 to 6 inches
and ice accumulations around a light glaze.
* WHERE...Portions of south central, west central, and western
Maine. Portions of northern New Hampshire.
* WHEN...Until 5 PM EST this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Slippery roads are expected today due to a mix of snow,
sleet, and freezing drizzle.</description>
