<headline>Heat Advisory issued June 23 at 8:50PM PDT until June 26 at 11:00PM PDT by NWS Seattle</headline>
<description>...HEAT ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON SATURDAY TO 11 PM
PDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Hot conditions with high temperatures in the mid to
upper 80s. Overnight low temperatures will likely only cool
into the low 60s for many locations Saturday night into Sunday
morning. This will pose a moderate risk of heat-related
illness.
* WHERE...North Coast and Central Coast.
* WHEN...From noon Saturday to 11 PM PDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Hot conditions will increase the risk of heat-
related illnesses for those who are sensitive to heat,
especially those without effective cooling or adequate
hydration.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A significant increase in cold- and high-
water related incidents is possible. Recent rains and late
snowmelt has lead to high, fast and cold flows on area
waterways. Cold water shock can lead to life-threatening
hypothermia within minutes. Use extreme caution if recreating
near water, wear a life jacket, and supervise children closely.</description>
<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.
