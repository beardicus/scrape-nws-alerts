<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued June 23 at 2:21PM PDT until June 23 at 5:15PM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Reno has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
The East Dixie and Beckwourth burn scars. in...
Plumas County in northern California...
* Until 515 PM PDT.
* At 221 PM PDT, A trained weather spotter reported thunderstorms
producing heavy rain over the East Dixie and Beckwourth burn
scars. Between 1 and 1.5 inches of rain have fallen. The expected
rainfall rate is 0.5 to 1 inch in 1 hour. Flash flooding is
ongoing.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar is resulting in debris flow
moving through the East Dixie and Beckwourth burn scars. The debris
flow can consist of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms in and around
the East Dixie and Beckwourth burn scars.
SOURCE...Trained spotter reported.
IMPACT...Flooding of areas in and around the East Dixie and
Beckwourth burn scars.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Frenchman Lake.
FLASH FLOOD...OBSERVED
EXPECTED RAINFALL RATE...0.5-1 INCH IN 1 HOUR</description>
<instruction>This is a life threatening situation. Heavy rainfall will cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks...streams...and
ditches in the East Dixie and Beckwourth burn scars. Severe debris
flows can also be anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may
be washed away in places. If you encounter flood waters...climb to
safety.
A Flash Flood Warning for a recent burn area means that flooding
and/or debris flows are imminent or occurring. Residents living in
or immediately downstream should take immediate precautions to
protect life. Quickly move away from the burn area only if it is
safe to do so, otherwise shelter in place and move to a second story
or the highest location in your home to stay out of the path of
fast-moving water and debris flows.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Move to higher ground now. Act quickly to protect your life.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
