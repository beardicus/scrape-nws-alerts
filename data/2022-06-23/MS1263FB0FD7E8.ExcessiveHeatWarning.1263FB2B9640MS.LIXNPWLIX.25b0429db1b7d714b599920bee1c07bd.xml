<headline>Excessive Heat Warning issued June 23 at 1:18PM CDT until June 24 at 7:00PM CDT by NWS New Orleans</headline>
<description>...HEAT ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM CDT FRIDAY...
...EXCESSIVE HEAT WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM TO 7 PM CDT
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Excessive Heat Warning, heat index values in
excess of 112 degrees. For the Heat Advisory, heat index values
between 108 and 112.
* WHERE...Portions of southeast and southern Mississippi and
southeast Louisiana.
* WHEN...For the Excessive Heat Warning, from 10 AM to 7 PM CDT
Friday. For the Heat Advisory, until 10 AM CDT Friday.
* IMPACTS...Extreme heat and humidity will significantly increase
the potential for heat related illnesses, particularly for those
working or participating in outdoor activities. Overnight lows
in the 80s, especially in urban areas, will not provide much
relief from the heat for those that do not have access to air
conditioning or shelters.</description>
<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
