        <headline>Flood Advisory issued July 10 at 8:04PM EDT until July 11 at 1:45AM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg SC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...Nuisance flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.

* WHERE...A portion of western North Carolina, including the
following county, Caldwell.

* WHEN...Until 145 AM EDT.

* IMPACTS...Nuisance to Minor flooding of low-lying areas adjacent
to streams and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland,
parks, greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses,
and parking lots. Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is
possible. A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may become
impassible. A small culvert washout or two is possible.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 754 PM EDT, Doppler radar and automated gauges indicated
heavy rain across western and southern portions of Caldwell
County. Between 1 and 2.5 inches of rain have fallen
prompting concerns for excessive runoff capable of producing
areas of nuisance to Minor flooding.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are expected
over the area. This additional rain will result in minor
flooding, especially in areas that received heavy rain fall
yesterday. Rapid rises along the upper reaches of the Johns
River, Wilson Creek, Lower Creek, and other small tributaries
and waterways can be expected.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Lenoir, Gamewell, Cajah's Mountain, Blowing Rock In Caldwell
County, Cedar Rock, Grandfather Mountain State Park, B.R.

        <instruction>When it is safe to do so, please report flooding or landslides
threatening roads or property to the National Weather Service
Greenville-Spartanburg by calling toll free, 1, 800, 2 6 7, 8 1 0 1,
by posting on our Facebook page, or via X using hashtag NWSGSP. Your
message should describe the specific location where impacts occurred
and the depth of flooding observed.

In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.

Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
