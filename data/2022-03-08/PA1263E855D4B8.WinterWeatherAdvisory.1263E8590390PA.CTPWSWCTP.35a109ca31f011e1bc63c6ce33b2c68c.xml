<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM TO 4 PM EST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 3 inches.
The largest snow amounts will be at the higher elevations and on
ridges.
* WHERE...Cambria and Somerset Counties.
* WHEN...From 1 AM to 4 PM EST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could affect the morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The snow will be heaviest between 5 AM and
1 PM. Much of the snow may melt as it falls as temperatures
will warm slightly through the day. That could cut down eventual
snow totals.</description>

Turnpike Commission remind motorists to adjust speeds based on
driving conditions as winter weather impacts will include snow
