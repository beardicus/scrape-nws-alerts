<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM WEDNESDAY TO 9 AM
AKST THURSDAY FROM KIPNUK NORTH...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow accumulations of
up to one inch and ice accumulations up to one tenth of an inch.
Northeasterly winds 20 to 30 mph, gusting as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...Kuskokwim Delta from Kipnuk north.
* WHEN...From 6 PM Wednesday to 9 AM AKST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel may be difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The combination of warm air and moisture
aloft moving over colder air near the surface will create the
potential for a band of freezing rain to develop Wednesday
night. The band will move southward through the night as
temperatures cool. Freezing rain will begin in the northern
Kuskokwim Delta Wednesday evening and work southward, reaching
its southern extent along a line from Bethel to Kipnuk around
midnight. Freezing rain will transition to snow from north to
south as temperatures aloft begin to cool. Freezing rain may
persist near Kipnuk into the morning until precipitation begins
to taper off on Thursday.</description>
