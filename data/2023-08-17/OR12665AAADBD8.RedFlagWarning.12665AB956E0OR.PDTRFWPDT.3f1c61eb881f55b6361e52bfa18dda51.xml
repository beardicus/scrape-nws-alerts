...ISOLATED TO SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS OVER SOUTH CENTRAL OREGON
THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING...
.On Thursday, winds will increase for areas in and around the
Lower Columbia Basin. Meanwhile, a monsoonal wave over southern
and central Oregon will result in isolated to widely scattered
thunderstorm chances in the afternoon and evening Thursday. These
storms will be capable of producing abundant lightning. On
Friday, a cold front will sweep across Washington and northern
Oregon for even stronger winds with critically low humidity.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO
11 PM PDT THIS EVENING FOR WIND AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR
FIRE WEATHER ZONE OR611...
* AFFECTED AREA...Fire Weather Zone 611 Deschutes National
Forest  -minus Sisters Ranger District.
* IMPACTS...New fire starts from lightning. Very dry and
unstable conditions could result in extreme fire behavior.
* THUNDERSTORMS...Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms
will develop over northern Klamath and southern Deschutes
counties. While there is a 30 percent chance that storms will
bring heavy rain, lightning strikes outside of the heavy rain
cores will also threaten this area with new fire starts.
* OUTFLOW WINDS...Storms will be capable of producing gusty and
erratic winds.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now, or will shortly. A combination of
