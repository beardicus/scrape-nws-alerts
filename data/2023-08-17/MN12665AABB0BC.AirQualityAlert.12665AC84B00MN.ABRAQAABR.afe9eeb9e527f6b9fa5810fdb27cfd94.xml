<description>...AIR AQUALITY ALERT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM CDT FRIDAY...
* WHAT...The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has issued an Air
Quality Alert for fine particles pollution. The Air Quality Index
(AQI) is expected to reach the Orange or Unhealthy for Sensitive
Groups category.
* WHERE...Western Minnesota.
* WHEN...Until 11 PM CDT Friday.
* IMPACTS...Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease
(including asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults, may
experience health effects.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Heavy ground-level smoke from wildfires in the
Northwest Territories of Canada has reached northwest Minnesota
Thurday morning. Strong northwest winds will bring this smoke into
central Minnesota by Thursday afternoon. Smoke levels are lower than
expected and the alert has been downgraded to Orange for the alert
area. Winds will become southerly overnight and will prevent the
heaviest smoke from reaching southern Minnesota. The alert has been
cancelled for far southern Minnesota, along with the Arrowhead
region. Smoke will linger across the alert area through Friday
afternoon. Smoke will continue to disperse as it retreats away from
the state. Air quality should improve below alert levels by late
Friday.

<instruction>Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including
asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults, should limit
prolonged or heavy exertion.
Reduce or eliminate activities that contribute to air pollution, such
as outdoor burning, and use of residential wood burning devices.
Reduce vehicle trips and vehicle idling as much as possible.
Keep windows closed overnight to prevent smoke from getting indoors.</instruction>
