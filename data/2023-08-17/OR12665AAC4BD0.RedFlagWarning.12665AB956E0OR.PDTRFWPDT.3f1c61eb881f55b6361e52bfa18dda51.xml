<headline>Red Flag Warning issued August 17 at 1:52PM PDT until August 17 at 11:00PM PDT by NWS Pendleton</headline>
<description>...GUSTY WINDS AND LOW HUMIDITY THROUGH FRIDAY...
...ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE OVER SOUTH CENTRAL OREGON
THROUGH THE EVENING...
.Breezy winds have begun to materialize across the Columbia Basin
and Cascade Gaps this afternoon. Gusts up to 30 mph are possible,
with stronger winds expected Friday afternoon and evening, when
gusts could eclipse 35 mph at times. This, combined with the
recent heat wave, will make for critical fire weather conditions.
Central Oregon may also see thunderstorm development late this
afternoon into the late evening hours, however confidence has
decreased due to the cloud cover that has encompassed the area for
much of the day today.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM PDT THIS
EVENING FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONE OR611...
* AFFECTED AREA...Fire Weather Zone 611 Deschutes National
Forest  -minus Sisters Ranger District.
* IMPACTS...New fire starts from lightning. Very dry and
unstable conditions could result in extreme fire behavior.
* THUNDERSTORMS...Isolated thunderstorms may develop over northern
Klamath and southern Deschutes counties. Lightning strikes
outside of the heavy rain cores may threaten this area with new
fire starts.
* OUTFLOW WINDS...Storms will be capable of producing gusty and
erratic winds.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now, or will shortly. A combination of
strong winds, low relative humidity, and warm temperatures can
contribute to extreme fire behavior.</instruction>
