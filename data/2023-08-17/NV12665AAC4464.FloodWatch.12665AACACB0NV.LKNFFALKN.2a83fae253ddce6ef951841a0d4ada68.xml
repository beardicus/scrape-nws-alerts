<headline>Flood Watch issued August 17 at 1:33PM PDT  by NWS Elko</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY EVENING THROUGH LATE MONDAY
NIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall and localized heavy
rainfall from thunderstorms is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of eastern, north central, northeast, and south
central Nevada, including the following areas, in eastern Nevada,
White Pine County. In north central Nevada, Southern Lander County
and Southern Eureka County. In northeast Nevada, Ruby Mountains
and East Humboldt Range. In south central Nevada, Northeastern Nye
County and Northwestern Nye County.
* WHEN...From Saturday evening through late Monday night.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poorly drained areas and urban areas.
Low-water crossings may be flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Deep Tropical moisture is forecast to move northward into
portions of northern Nye County, Southern Lander and Eureka
Counties, White Pine counties and southern Elko County mainly
affecting the Ruby Mountains starting late on Saturday
lasting at least through Monday morning. The moisture,
atmospheric instability, and weak lift associated with the
decaying remnants of Hilary will aid in the potential for
moderate to heavy rainfall and the potential of localized
heavy rainfall from thunderstorms that could lead to flash
flooding.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
