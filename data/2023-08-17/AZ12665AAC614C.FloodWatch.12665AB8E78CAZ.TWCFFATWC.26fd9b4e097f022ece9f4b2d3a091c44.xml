<headline>Flood Watch issued August 17 at 2:07PM MST until August 17 at 8:15PM MST by NWS Tucson</headline>
<description>.Moisture moving north in advance of Hurricane Hilary is expected to
enhance the potential for heavy rainfall producing showers and
thunderstorms for areas south and west of Tucson Saturday afternoon
through Saturday night.  Multiple storms with heavy rainfall moving
over the same location is also a possibility increasing the threat
of heavy runoff and flooding.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE SATURDAY MORNING THROUGH SUNDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of Southeast Arizona, including the following
areas, Baboquivari Mountains, Tohono O`odham Nation, Upper Santa
Cruz River Valley/Altar Valley and Western Pima County.
* WHEN...From Saturday morning through Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Storms could produce very heavy short duration rainfall
resulting in local Flash Flooding (rapid rises) while
repetitive rains over a larger area could also result in
significant rises in slower responding water ways such as the
Vamori Wash.
