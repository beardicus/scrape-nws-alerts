<headline>Flood Watch issued August 17 at 1:17PM PDT  by NWS Phoenix</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY MORNING THROUGH MONDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Arizona, including the following areas, Aguila
Valley, Central La Paz, Gila Bend, Gila River Valley, Kofa, Parker
Valley, Sonoran Desert Natl Monument, Southeast Yuma County,
Tonopah Desert, West Pinal County and Yuma. Portions of
California, including the following areas, Chiriaco Summit,
Chuckwalla Mountains, Chuckwalla Valley, Imperial County
Southeast, Imperial County Southwest, Imperial County West,
Imperial Valley, Joshua Tree NP East, Joshua Tree NP West, Palo
Verde Valley and Salton Sea.
* WHEN...From Saturday morning through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Area creeks
and streams are running high and could flood with more heavy rain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A rich moisture plume will accompany tropical cyclone Hilary
as it progresses north along the west coast of Mexico and
into Southern California this weekend. This will lead to
widespread heavy rainfall across Southern California and
Southwestern Arizona through this weekend. A combination of
rapid onset and slow response flooding is expected with high
rain rates and rainfall totals. Rainfall totals will be
highest in the mountains of Southern California, in upslope
favored regions, and with banding. With rainfall amounts
forecast around 2-4 inches across Southern California and
Southwest AZ, and localized amounts up to 6+ inches, there is
potential for considerable flooding across the region.
