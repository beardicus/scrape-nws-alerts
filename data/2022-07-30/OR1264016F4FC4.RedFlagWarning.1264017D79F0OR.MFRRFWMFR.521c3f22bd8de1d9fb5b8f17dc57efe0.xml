<description>...Abundant Lightning On Dry Fuels Expected This Weekend...
.Heat, instability, and increasing moisture along with a couple of
low pressure impulses moving through today and Sunday into Monday
are expected to bring scattered thunderstorms and abundant
lightning on dry fuels this weekend. Today, thunderstorms are
expected to develop mid to late afternoon across western Siskiyou
County, across the Siskiyous, and over portions of the Southern Oregon
Cascades. These thunderstorms are then likely to propagate across
portions of Jackson and Josephine counties. Sunday into Monday, an
approaching low pressure system will bring another round of
lightning to areas east of the coastal ranges to the Cascades and
into Klamath and northwest Lake County as well as across western
and central Siskiyou.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO
8 PM PDT THIS EVENING FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE
WEATHER ZONES 280, 617, 620, 621, AND 622...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH MONDAY MORNING FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR
FIRE WEATHER ZONES 280, 617, 620, 621, AND 622...
* Impacts: Lightning and high fire danger will likely result in
new fire starts. Gusty thunderstorm winds could contribute to
fire spread. Despite rainfall, initial attack resources could be
overwhelmed and holdover fires are possible.
* Affected area:
In Northern CA Fire Zone....280.
In Southwest OR Fire Zones...617...620...621...622.
* Wind: Gusty outflow winds of 30 to as high as 50 mph will be
possible with stronger thunderstorm cells today and again Sunday
into Monday.
* Thunderstorms: Today, thunderstorms are expected to develop mid
to late afternoon across western Siskiyou County, across the
Siskiyous, and over portions of the Oregon Cascades. These
thunderstorms are then likely to propagate across portions of
Jackson and Josephine counties. Sunday into Monday, an
approaching low pressure system will bring another round of
lightning to areas east of the coastal ranges to the Cascades and
into Klamath and northwest Lake County as well as across western
and central Siskiyou.
* Rainfall: Thunderstorms today may begin dry and then transition
to a mix of wet and dry. Sunday into Monday the thunderstorms
will be a mix of wet and dry, as well. Locally significant
wetting rainfall will be possible with some of the thunderstorms,
especially the slower moving ones.
