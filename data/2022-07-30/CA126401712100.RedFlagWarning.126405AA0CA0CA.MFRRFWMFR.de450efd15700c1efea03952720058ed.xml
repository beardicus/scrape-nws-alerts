<description>...Abundant Lightning On Dry Fuels Expected This Weekend and, Likely

Siskiyous, and over portions of the Southern Oregon Cascades. These
thunderstorms are then likely to propagate across portions of
Jackson and Josephine counties. Sunday into Monday, an approaching
low pressure system will bring more abundant lightning to areas from
the Marble Mountains and Siskiyous northeastward.

Avoid tossing burning cigarettes on the ground, parking hot
vehicles on dry vegetation, and using equipment that can cause
sparks. Follow all fire restrictions. Find links to restrictions
at weather.gov/medford/wildfire. One less spark, one less
wildfire.

want to lose and prioritize your checklist. Visit ready.gov/kit

How will you get there? Who will you call to let others know your
are safe? Visit ready.gov/wildfires for more information.
A Red Flag Warning does not mean there is a fire. It means that
critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now or will
shortly. These conditions promote rapid spread of fire which may
become life threatening. Evacuate if ordered to, or if a fire
threatens.
If you have not packed your evacuation kit yet, now is the time to
do so. This includes items like important documents and essentials
you cannot live without. Fill your vehicle`s fuel tank. Visit
ready.gov/kit for more information.
Plan now to avoid using equipment that could cause sparks during
the period when critical weather conditions are possible. Visit
weather.gov/medford/wildfire for links to fire restrictions in
your area.
A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are possible during the valid watch time. These conditions could
promote the rapid spread of wildfires which could become life-
threatening. Check weather.gov/medford for forecast updates and a
possible upgrade of the this watch to a Red Flag Warning.
