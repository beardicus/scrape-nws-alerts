<headline>Red Flag Warning issued July 30 at 3:08PM PDT until July 30 at 8:00PM PDT by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...Abundant Lightning On Dry Fuels Expected This Weekend and, Likely
into Monday...
.Heat, instability, and increasing moisture along with multiple low
pressure impulses moving through today through Monday are expected
to bring scattered thunderstorms and abundant lightning on dry fuels
to the area. Today, thunderstorms are expected to develop mid to
late afternoon across portions of Siskiyou County, across the
Siskiyous, and over portions of the Southern Oregon Cascades. These
thunderstorms are then likely to propagate across portions of
Jackson and Josephine counties. Sunday into Monday, an approaching
low pressure system will bring more abundant lightning to areas from
the Marble Mountains and Siskiyous northeastward.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM PDT THIS EVENING
FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONES 280, 617,
620, 621, AND 622...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IS CANCELLED FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY
FUELS FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONES 280, 617, 620, 621, AND 622...
The National Weather Service in Medford has cancelled the Fire
Weather Watch for Sunday into Monday, though isolated thunderstorms
will be possible.
* Impacts: Abundant lightning on critically dry vegetation will
likely result in numerous new fire starts today and, likely, on
Monday. Gusty thunderstorm outflow winds could contribute to fire
spread. Despite locally heavy downpours that could be wetting,
initial attack resources could be overwhelmed and holdover fires
are possible.
* Affected area: In Southwest OR...Fire Weather Zone 620.
* Wind: Gusty outflow winds of 30 to as high as 50 mph will be
possible with stronger thunderstorm cells today and again Sunday
into Monday.
* Thunderstorms: Today, thunderstorms are expected to develop mid-
late afternoon across portions of Siskiyou County, across the
Siskiyous, and over portions of the Southern Oregon Cascades.
These thunderstorms are then likely to propagate across portions
of Jackson and Josephine counties.
* Rainfall: Thunderstorms today will begin dry and then transition
to a mix of wet and dry. Monday the thunderstorms are more likely
to produce wetting rainfall where they occur. Locally significant
wetting rainfall will be possible with some of the
thunderstorms, especially the slower moving ones.

Precautionary/preparedness actions...
Avoid tossing burning cigarettes on the ground, parking hot vehicles
on dry vegetation, and using equipment that can cause sparks. Follow
all fire restrictions. Find links to restrictions at
weather.gov/medford/wildfire. One less spark, one less wildfire.
Gather your fire evacuation kit now. Collect essentials you don`t
want to lose and prioritize your checklist. Visit ready.gov/kit for
more information.
Familiarize yourself with your evacuation plan. Where will you go?
How will you get there? Who will you call to let others know your
are safe? Visit ready.gov/wildfires for more information.
A Red Flag Warning does not mean there is a fire. It means that
critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now or will
shortly. These conditions promote rapid spread of fire which may
become life threatening. Evacuate if ordered to, or if a fire
threatens.
