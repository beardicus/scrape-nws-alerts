<description>...Abundant Lightning On Dry Fuels Expected This Weekend and, Likely
into Monday...
.Heat, instability, and increasing moisture along with multiple low
pressure impulses moving through today through Monday are expected
to bring scattered thunderstorms and abundant lightning on dry fuels
to the area. Today, thunderstorms are expected to develop mid to
late afternoon across portions of Siskiyou County, across the
Siskiyous, and over portions of the Southern Oregon Cascades. These
thunderstorms are then likely to propagate across portions of
Jackson and Josephine counties. Sunday into Monday, an approaching
low pressure system will bring more abundant lightning to areas from
the Marble Mountains and Siskiyous northeastward.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY MORNING THROUGH MONDAY
EVENING FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONE
625...
The National Weather Service in Medford has issued a Fire Weather
Watch...which is in effect from Monday morning through Monday
evening. THE Fire Weather Watch has been cancelled.
* Impacts: Abundant lightning on critically dry vegetation will
likely result in numerous new fire starts on Monday. Gusty
thunderstorm outflow winds could contribute to fire spread.
Despite locally heavy downpours that could be wetting, initial
attack resources could be overwhelmed and holdover fires are
possible.
* Affected area: In South Central OR...Fire Weather Zone 625.
* Thunderstorms: While isolated thunderstorms will be possible
today and Sunday, the possibility of abundant lightning is
currently greatest on Monday for this area.
* Rainfall: Monday scattered thunderstorms will be a mix of wet and
dry, as well. Locally significant wetting rainfall will be
possible with some of the thunderstorms, especially the slower
moving ones.

If you have not packed your evacuation kit yet, now is the time to
do so. This includes items like important documents and essentials
you cannot live without. Fill your vehicle`s fuel tank. Visit
ready.gov/kit for more information.
Plan now to avoid using equipment that could cause sparks during the
period when critical weather conditions are possible. Visit
weather.gov/medford/wildfire for links to fire restrictions in your
area.
A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions are
possible during the valid watch time. These conditions could promote
the rapid spread of wildfires which could become life-threatening.
