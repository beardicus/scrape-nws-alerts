<description>...Abundant Lightning On Dry Fuels Expected through Monday...
.Heat, instability, and increasing moisture along with multiple
low pressure impulses moving through Monday are expected to bring
scattered thunderstorms and abundant lightning on dry fuels to the
area. Sunday into Monday, an approaching low pressure system will
bring more abundant lightning to areas from the Marble Mountains
and Siskiyous northeastward.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY MORNING
THROUGH MONDAY EVENING FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR
FIRE WEATHER ZONE 625...
* Impacts:  Lightning and high fire danger will likely result in
new fire starts. Gusty thunderstorm winds could contribute to fire
spread. Despite rainfall, initial attack resources could be
overwhelmed and holdover fires are possible.
* Affected area:
In Northern CA Fire Zone....285.
In South Central OR Fire Zone....625.
* Thunderstorms: While isolated thunderstorms will be possible
Sunday, the possibility of abundant lightning is currently
greatest on Monday for this area.
* Rainfall: Monday, scattered thunderstorms will be a mix of wet
and dry. Locally significant wetting rainfall will be possible
with some of the thunderstorms, especially the slower moving
ones.
