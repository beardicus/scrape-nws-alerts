<description>...Abundant Lightning On Dry Fuels Expected This Weekend and, Likely
into Monday...
.Heat, instability, and increasing moisture along with multiple low
pressure impulses moving through today through Monday are expected
to bring scattered thunderstorms and abundant lightning on dry fuels
to the area. Today, thunderstorms are expected to develop mid to
late afternoon across portions of Siskiyou County, across the
Siskiyous, and over portions of the Southern Oregon Cascades. These
thunderstorms are then likely to propagate across portions of
Jackson and Josephine counties. Sunday into Monday, an approaching
low pressure system will bring more abundant lightning to areas from
the Marble Mountains and Siskiyous northeastward.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY MORNING THROUGH MONDAY
EVENING FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONE

overwhelmed and holdover fires are possible.

If you have not packed your evacuation kit yet, now is the time to
do so. This includes items like important documents and essentials
you cannot live without. Fill your vehicle`s fuel tank. Visit

Plan now to avoid using equipment that could cause sparks during
the period when critical weather conditions are possible. Visit

A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are possible during the valid watch time. These conditions could
promote the rapid spread of wildfires which could become life-
threatening. Check weather.gov/medford for forecast updates and a
possible upgrade of the this watch to a Red Flag Warning.
