<headline>Flood Watch issued July 30 at 8:52AM PDT until August 03 at 5:00PM PDT by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of southwest California, including the following
areas, Antelope Valley, Los Angeles County Mountains, Los Angeles
County San Gabriel Valley, Santa Clarita Valley and Ventura County
Mountains.
* WHEN...Through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Low-water crossings may be flooded. Debris flows may be a concern
in and around the Bobcat, Lake, Ranch 2 and Dam Burn areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Copious moisture near climatological maximum across the
region will support heavy rainfall with rates in excess of
one inch per hour possible. However, the potential coverage
of thunderstorms remain in question with a range of
possibilities including limited coverage focused across the
most prone mountain locations to more widespread overage
across the watch area. Any storms that do form will move
slowly will would enhance the risk of heavy rainfall and
dangerous flash flooding. An additional Flood Watch may be
needed for Sunday.
