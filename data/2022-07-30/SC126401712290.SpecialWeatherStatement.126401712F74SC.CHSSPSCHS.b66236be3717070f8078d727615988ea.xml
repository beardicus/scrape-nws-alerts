<description>...STRONG THUNDERSTORMS WILL IMPACT PORTIONS OF LAKE MOULTRIE...
...MARINERS SHOULD SEEK SAFE HARBOR...
At 611 PM EDT, National Weather Service doppler radar indicated a
strong thunderstorm over Southern Lake Moultrie, or near Moncks
Corner, moving northeast at 5 knots.
HAZARD...gusty winds 30 to 40 knots.
SOURCE...Radar Indicated.
IMPACT...Expect briefly stronger winds and suddenly higher waves.
MAX HAIL SIZE...0.00 IN

<instruction>Boaters on Lake Moultrie should seek safe harbor immediately. If
caught on the open water, stay as low as possible and wear a personal
flotation device. Remember, if you can hear thunder you are at risk
for being struck by lightning.
Beaches are especially dangerous during thunderstorms because
lightning will usually strike the tallest object in the vicinity.
Move off beaches and get in a sturdy structure or automobile
immediately. Many people have been killed by lightning on beaches in
the southeastern United States.</instruction>
