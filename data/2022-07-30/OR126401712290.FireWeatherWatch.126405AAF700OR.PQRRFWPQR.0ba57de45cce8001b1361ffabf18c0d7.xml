<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued July 30 at 3:12PM PDT until August 01 at 5:00AM PDT by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>..Isolated to Scattered Thunderstorms with Abundant Lightning On
Dry Fuels Possible Sunday...
.Hot and unstable conditions are expected on Sunday as an upper
ridge of high pressure remains over the region. A cut-off low
offshore will bring increasing midlevel moisture and southerly
flow aloft. This will bring increased potential for isolated to
scattered thunderstorms to develop mainly across the central
Cascades of Oregon. Any storms that do develop would come with
abundant lightning and strong gusty outflow winds.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
LATE SUNDAY NIGHT FOR THUNDERSTORMS FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONE 608...

Weather Watch for thunderstorms, which is in effect from Sunday
afternoon through late Sunday night.

National Forest.
* THUNDERSTORMS...3 (A chance of thunderstorms).
* OUTFLOW WINDS...Gusty and erratic outflow winds of 30 to 50 mph
may occur with thunderstorms.
* IMPACTS...Frequent lightning and critically dry fuels may
result in numerous fire starts. Thunderstorm outflow winds may
result in erratic fire spread.</description>
