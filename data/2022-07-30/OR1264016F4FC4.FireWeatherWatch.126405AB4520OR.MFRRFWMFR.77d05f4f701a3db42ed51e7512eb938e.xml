<description>...Abundant Lightning On Dry Fuels Expected This Weekend...
.Heat, instability, and increasing moisture along with a couple of
low pressure impulses moving through today and Sunday into Monday
are expected to bring scattered thunderstorms and abundant
lightning on dry fuels this weekend. Today, thunderstorms are
expected to develop mid to late afternoon across western Siskiyou
County, across the Siskiyous, and over portions of the Southern Oregon
Cascades. These thunderstorms are then likely to propagate across
portions of Jackson and Josephine counties. Sunday into Monday, an
approaching low pressure system will bring another round of
lightning to areas east of the coastal ranges to the Cascades and
into Klamath and northwest Lake County as well as across western
and central Siskiyou.
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO 8 PM PDT
THIS EVENING FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE WEATHER
ZONE 623...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH MONDAY MORNING FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR
FIRE WEATHER ZONES 623...
The National Weather Service in Medford has issued a Red Flag
Warning...which is in effect from 2 PM this afternoon to 8 PM PDT
this evening.
* Impacts: Abundant lightning on critically dry vegetation will
likely result in numerous new fire starts. Gusty thunderstorm
winds could contribute to fire spread. Despite locally heavy
downpour that could be wetting, initial attack resources could
be overwhelmed and holdover fires are possible.
* Affected area:
In Southwest OR...Fire Weather Zone 623.
* Wind: Gusty outflow winds of 30 to as high as 50 mph will be
possible with stronger thunderstorm cells today and again Sunday
into Monday.
* Thunderstorms: Today, thunderstorms are expected to develop mid to
late afternoon across western Siskiyou County, across the
Siskiyous, and over portions of the Oregon Cascades. These
thunderstorms are then likely to propagate across portions of
Jackson and Josephine counties. Sunday into Monday, an
approaching low pressure system will bring another round of
lightning to areas east of the coastal ranges to the Cascades and
into Klamath and northwest Lake County as well as across western
and central Siskiyou.
* Rainfall: Thunderstorms today may begin dry and then transition
to a mix of wet and dry. Sunday into Monday the thunderstorms
will be a mix of wet and dry, as well. Locally significant
wetting rainfall will be possible with some of the thunderstorms,
especially the slower moving ones.

Precautionary/preparedness actions...
Avoid tossing burning cigarettes on the ground, parking hot
vehicles on dry vegetation, and using equipment that can cause
sparks. Follow all fire restrictions. Find links to restrictions
at weather.gov/medford/wildfire. One less spark, one less
wildfire.
Gather your fire evacuation kit now. Collect essentials you don`t
want to lose and prioritize your checklist. Visit ready.gov/kit
for more information.
Familiarize yourself with your evacuation plan. Where will you go?
How will you get there? Who will you call to let others know your
are safe? Visit ready.gov/wildfires for more information.
A Red Flag Warning does not mean there is a fire. It means that
critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now or will
shortly. These conditions promote rapid spread of fire which may
become life threatening. Evacuate if ordered to, or if a fire
threatens.
