* IMPACTS...High risk of heath health impacts for much of the
population, especially those without sufficient cooling or
hydration resources, and those outdoors for extended periods
of time.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...While daytime high temperatures will be
near or above records, limited overnight cooling will
exacerbate heat health impacts especially for those without
air conditioning.</description>
<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
