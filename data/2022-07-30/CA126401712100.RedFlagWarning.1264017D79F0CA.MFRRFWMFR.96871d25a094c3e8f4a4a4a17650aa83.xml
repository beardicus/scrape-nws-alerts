<description>...Abundant Lightning On Dry Fuels Expected This Weekend and, Likely
into Monday...
.Heat, instability, and increasing moisture along with multiple low
pressure impulses moving through today through Monday are expected
to bring scattered thunderstorms and abundant lightning on dry fuels
to the area. Today, thunderstorms are expected to develop mid to
late afternoon across portions of Siskiyou County, across the
Siskiyous, and over portions of the Southern Oregon Cascades. These
thunderstorms are then likely to propagate across portions of
Jackson and Josephine counties. Sunday into Monday, an approaching
low pressure system will bring more abundant lightning to areas from
the Marble Mountains and Siskiyous northeastward.

spread. Despite rainfall, initial attack resources could be
overwhelmed and holdover fires are possible.
* Affected area:
In Northern CA Fire Zone....280.
In Southwest OR Fire Zones...617...623.
* Wind: Gusty outflow winds of 30 to as high as 50 mph will be
possible with stronger thunderstorm cells today and again Sunday
into Monday.
* Thunderstorms: Today, thunderstorms are expected to develop mid-
late afternoon across portions of Siskiyou County, across the
Siskiyous, and over portions of the Southern Oregon Cascades.
These thunderstorms are then likely to propagate across portions
of Jackson and Josephine counties.
* Rainfall: Thunderstorms today will begin dry and then transition
to a mix of wet and dry. Monday the thunderstorms are more likely
to produce wetting rainfall where they occur. Locally significant
wetting rainfall will be possible with some of the
thunderstorms, especially the slower moving ones.

Precautionary/preparedness actions...
Avoid tossing burning cigarettes on the ground, parking hot
vehicles on dry vegetation, and using equipment that can cause
sparks. Follow all fire restrictions. Find links to restrictions
at weather.gov/medford/wildfire. One less spark, one less
wildfire.
Gather your fire evacuation kit now. Collect essentials you don`t
want to lose and prioritize your checklist. Visit ready.gov/kit
for more information.
Familiarize yourself with your evacuation plan. Where will you go?
How will you get there? Who will you call to let others know your
are safe? Visit ready.gov/wildfires for more information.
A Red Flag Warning does not mean there is a fire. It means that
critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now or will
shortly. These conditions promote rapid spread of fire which may
become life threatening. Evacuate if ordered to, or if a fire
threatens.
If you have not packed your evacuation kit yet, now is the time to
do so. This includes items like important documents and essentials
you cannot live without. Fill your vehicle`s fuel tank. Visit
ready.gov/kit for more information.
Plan now to avoid using equipment that could cause sparks during
the period when critical weather conditions are possible. Visit
weather.gov/medford/wildfire for links to fire restrictions in
your area.
A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are possible during the valid watch time. These conditions could
promote the rapid spread of wildfires which could become life-
threatening. Check weather.gov/medford for forecast updates and a
possible upgrade of the this watch to a Red Flag Warning.
