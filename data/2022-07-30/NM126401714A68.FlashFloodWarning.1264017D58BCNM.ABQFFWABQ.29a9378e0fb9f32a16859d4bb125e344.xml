FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Arroyos, streams, and normally dry rivers can become raging killer
currents in a matter of minutes. Water in arroyos can travel many
miles and take hours to reach your location from upstream rain areas.
Both localized and distant heavy rainfall will create sudden and
dangerous flows in arroyos and over low water crossings.</instruction>
