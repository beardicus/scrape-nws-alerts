new fire starts. Gusty thunderstorm winds could contribute to fire
spread. Despite rainfall, initial attack resources could be
overwhelmed and holdover fires are possible.

In Southwest OR Fire Zones...617...623.
* Wind: Southwest 10 to 15 mph with gusts up to 25 mph.
* Thunderstorms: Sunday, thunderstorms are expected to develop mid-
late afternoon across portions of Siskiyou County, and over
portions of the Southern Oregon Cascades.
* Rainfall: Thunderstorms Sunday will begin dry and then transition
to a mix of wet and dry. Monday the thunderstorms are more likely
to produce wetting rainfall. Locally significant wetting
rainfall will be possible with some of the thunderstorms,
especially the slower moving ones.

A Red Flag Warning does not mean there is a fire. It means that
critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now or will
shortly. These conditions promote rapid spread of fire which may
become life threatening. Evacuate if ordered to, or if a fire
threatens.
If you have not packed your evacuation kit yet, now is the time to
do so. This includes items like important documents and essentials
you cannot live without. Fill your vehicle`s fuel tank. Visit
ready.gov/kit for more information.
Plan now to avoid using equipment that could cause sparks during
the period when critical weather conditions are possible. Visit
weather.gov/medford/wildfire for links to fire restrictions in
your area.
A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are possible during the valid watch time. These conditions could
promote the rapid spread of wildfires which could become life-
threatening. Check weather.gov/medford for forecast updates and a
possible upgrade of the this watch to a Red Flag Warning.
