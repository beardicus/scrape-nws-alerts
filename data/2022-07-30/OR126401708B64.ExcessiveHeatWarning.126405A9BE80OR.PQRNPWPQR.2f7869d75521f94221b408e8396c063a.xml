<description>...EXCESSIVE HEAT WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM PDT
SUNDAY...
* WHAT...High heat risk. High temperatures 98F to 104F. Low
temperatures 60F to 70F.
* WHERE...In Oregon, Upper Hood River Valley, Western Columbia
River Gorge and Central Columbia River Gorge. In Washington,
Western Columbia River Gorge and Central Columbia River Gorge.
* WHEN...Until 9 PM PDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...The prolonged period of extreme heat will
significantly increase the potential for heat related
illnesses, particularly for those working or participating in
outdoor activities and for those that do not have access to
air conditioning.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Overnight lows in the upper 60s across
the higher hills of the region will provide little relief for
those without air conditioning. Low temperatures in low lying
areas, particularly in the upper Hood River Valley will drop
into the upper 50s to low 60s most nights between now and
Monday.</description>
<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances. If attempting to find relief from the
heat in rivers, lakes, or the ocean please apply safe water
practices and wear a life preserver.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
