<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY
AFTERNOON...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Dangerous surf conditions and rip currents expected due
to breaking waves between 8 to 12 feet.
* WHERE...Northern beaches of St. Thomas and St. John.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Monday afternoon.
For the High Surf Advisory, through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming conditions. Rip currents can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper
waters. Hazardous breaking waves. Localized beach erosion
is possible.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.</instruction>
