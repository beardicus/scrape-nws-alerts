<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 PM EST THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Areas of moderate flooding around the time this morning
high tide with one to three feet of inundation. Pockets of major
flooding expected in a few locations including Portland and
Hampton. Flooding may be prolonged and continue into the early
afternoon hours. Large, battering waves driven by storm force
southeasterly winds will lead to significant splash-over and
beach erosion.
* WHERE...In Maine, Coastal York, Coastal Cumberland, Sagadahoc,
Lincoln, Knox and Coastal Waldo Counties. In New Hampshire,
Coastal Rockingham County.
* WHEN...From 7 AM to 2 PM EST Friday.
* TIDAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Numerous roads may be closed. Low lying
property including homes, businesses, and some critical
infrastructure may be inundated and damaged. Shoreline erosion
will occur with damage to dune systems.
* WAVE IMPACTS...Expect moderate to locally severe beach erosion
with considerable erosion of protected dune structures due to
large breaking waves. Splash-over may lead to significant
ponding of water behind dune structures and result in flooding
of roads and vulnerable structures. Rocks associated with
splash-over may result in damage to passing vehicles or
pedestrians.
* ADDITIONAL TIDAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Widespread flooding of
locations near the waterfront expected, including some damage to
vulnerable structures. Numerous road closures expected. A few
locations will become isolated due to the flooding of roads.
Vehicles parked in vulnerable areas near the waterfront will
likely become flooded. Evacuations may be needed in the most
vulnerable areas. There is significant threat to property. Many
coastal communities will experience damage. Numerous structures
will flood. Flood waters will extend well inland in riverine
tidal areas and combine with the fresh water runoff leading to
additional flooding.
* WAVE IMPACTS...Expect moderate to locally significant beach
erosion with considerable erosion of protected dune structures
due to large breaking waves. Splash-over may lead to ponding
of water behind dune structures and result in flooding of
roads and vulnerable structures. Small rocks associated with
splash-over may result in damage to passing vehicles or
pedestrians.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
