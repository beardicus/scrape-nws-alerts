<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued December 23 at 2:37AM EST until December 23 at 1:00PM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM EST THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...One to two and a half, locally three feet of inundation
above ground level expected in vulnerable areas near the
waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...Northeast Suffolk, Southwest Suffolk and Southeast
Suffolk Counties.
* WHEN...From 3 AM to 1 PM EST Friday.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Widespread moderate to localized major
flooding of vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline
is becoming likely, with 1 to 2 1/2 feet, locally 3 ft, of
inundation above ground level in low lying, vulnerable areas.
This would result in numerous road closures and cause
widespread flooding of low lying property including parking
lots, parks, lawns and homes/businesses with basements near
the waterfront. A few buildings and homes near the waterfront
could experience flooding. Vehicles parked in vulnerable areas
near the waterfront will likely become flooded. Flooding could
also extend inland from the waterfront along tidal rivers and
bays.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...Along the ocean front, 10 to 15 ft
breakers (highest across eastern Long Island) will likely
result in widespread beach flooding and erosion during the
times of high tide. Areas of dune base erosion and localized
overwashes are likely as well. Along the south shore of the
north fork of Long Island, particularly Orient Point, 3 to 6
ft breaking waves will result in beach erosion and erosion of
dune structures. Wave splashover of dune structures and
bulkheads is possible in spots, which would cause flooding of
roadways and vulnerable structures behind protective
structures.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The potential for major flooding (3 ft of
inundation above ground) on Friday morning will depend on gale
force southeast winds occurring right through the time of high
tide. If winds are weaker or shift more to the south
southwest, moderate flood levels (2 ft of inundation) are more
likely. Additionally, there is potential for lingering minor
to moderate coastal flooding in the eastern Great South Bay
with the Friday evening high tide in response to a strong wind
shift sloshing trapped water to the eastern portion of Great
South Bay for the Fri eve high tidal cycle.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
