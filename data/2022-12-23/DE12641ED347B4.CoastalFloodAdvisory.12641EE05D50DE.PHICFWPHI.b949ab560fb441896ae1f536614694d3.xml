<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued December 23 at 2:25PM EST until December 24 at 12:00AM EST by NWS Philadelphia - Mount Holly</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EST TONIGHT...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IS CANCELLED...
* WHAT...Up to one foot of inundation above ground level in low-
lying areas.
* WHERE...Inland Sussex and Delaware Beaches.
* WHEN...Until midnight EST tonight.
* IMPACTS...At this level, flooding begins on the most
vulnerable roads in bayside communities and along tidal
waterways. Some partial or full road closures are possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Water levels have dropped below flood stage
across the oceanfront and inlets. As a result, the coastal flood
warnings have been allowed to expire for these areas. The
exceptions are Rehoboth and Little Assawoman Bays. Because of
the onshore flow we`ve seen ahead of the Arctic cold front, the
bays are not quickly draining. Tidal piling is occurring. As a
result, up to one foot of inundation above ground level can
still be expected across low-lying areas as we move through the
afternoon and into the evening.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
