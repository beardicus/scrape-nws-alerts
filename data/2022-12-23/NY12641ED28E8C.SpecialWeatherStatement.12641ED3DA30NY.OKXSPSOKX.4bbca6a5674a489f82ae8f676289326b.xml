<description>...Rapidly falling temperatures and gusty winds...
A strong Arctic cold front is expected to move through the region
from around 1 PM to 3 PM EST. The front will be accompanied with
briefly heavy showers, possibly with lightning, and strong gusty
winds of 40 to 50 mph. Southerly winds will shift to the west and
Arctic cold will begin to move into the region, with westerly
winds 20 to 30 mph and gusting 40 to 45 mph.
Temperatures will rapidly drop, as much as 15 to 20 degrees in
just a few hours, and will fall below freezing by late this
afternoon, and wind chills will be around 10 to 15 above zero by
late afternoon into the early evening. If venturing outside be
prepared for the rapidly changing conditions, and dress
appropriately.
Another concern is any standing water may become black ice late
this afternoon into the early evening hours.</description>
