<headline>Wind Chill Advisory issued December 23 at 9:09AM EST until December 24 at 10:00AM EST by NWS Philadelphia - Mount Holly</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM EST THIS
EVENING...
...WIND CHILL ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM THIS EVENING
TO 10 AM EST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Winter Weather Advisory, a cold front will move
west to east across the area late this morning bring rain
showers ending as a quick burst of snow with rapidly falling
temperatures. Any snow accumulation should be limited to a light
coasting, if that, but the main concern will be the potential
for briefly heavy rates that could lead to a quick drop in
visibility. Also, as temperatures rapidly drop below freezing
this will lead to a quick freezing of any wet surfaces resulting
in icy conditions. Also, southerly winds gusting up to 50 mph
ahead of the front will shift to westerly gusting up to 50 mph
in the front`s wake. For the Wind Chill Advisory, very cold wind
chills expected. Wind chills as low as 10 below zero.
* WHERE...Portions of southern Delaware and central and southern
New Jersey.
* WHEN...For the Winter Weather Advisory, until 6 PM EST this
evening. For the Wind Chill Advisory, from 6 PM this evening
to 10 AM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...The hazardous conditions could impact the evening
commute. Gusty winds could bring down tree branches resulting in
power outages. The cold wind chills could result in hypothermia
if precautions are not taken.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The snow will be brief but icy conditions
may linger through at least this afternoon.</description>
