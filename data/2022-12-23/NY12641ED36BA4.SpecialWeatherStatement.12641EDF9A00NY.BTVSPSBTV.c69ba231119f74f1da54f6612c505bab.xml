<description>...Difficult Travel Conditions Likely for Evening Commute...
An area of moderate to briefly heavy precipitation is expected to
lift into the Champlain Valley and much of Vermont through 7 pm.
Temperatures are currently above freezing so the precipitation
will start out as rain. However, a sharp drop in temperatures is
still expected this afternoon and evening as a strong cold front
crosses the region. This will cause any rain to quickly change to
snow and freeze any water standing on roadways. The snow may be
briefly heavy at times, reducing visibility to below 1 mile and
producing a dusting to a couple inches of accumulation.
Motorists are urged to remain alert for rapidly changing road
conditions through this evening. Roads that appear wet may in fact
be icy, and sharp reductions in visibility are likely.
Precautionary/Preparedness Actions...
Temperatures are above freezing, but sharply colder temperatures
following the snow will cause any water or slush to quickly freeze
on roads and sidewalks. Untreated surfaces will become extremely
slippery and offer little or no traction. Reduced speeds and
greater distance between vehicles is advised.</description>
