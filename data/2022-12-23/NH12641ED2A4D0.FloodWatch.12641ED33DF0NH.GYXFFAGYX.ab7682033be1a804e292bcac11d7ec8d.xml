<headline>Flood Watch issued December 23 at 10:08AM EST until December 23 at 2:00PM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>.A powerful storm system bringing moderate to heavy rainfall to the
region will lift north of the area tonight. The runoff and snowmelt
from the event will continue for hours after the rain has ended.
Overland flooding will increase in coverage as the day progresses.
For interior and mountain regions, the snowpack will hold but will
be reduced and result in some additional runoff. This rain in
combination with some snow melt and already high stream levels will
cause rapid rises especially on small streams and creeks. Minor
river flooding is possible as well which will continue even after
the rain moves out. Cold temperatures on the backside of the storm
system could cause flooded areas to freeze in place.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flash, urban, and small stream flooding expected from
widespread heavy rain and snowmelt.
* WHERE...Portions of Maine, including the following areas,
Androscoggin, Central Interior Cumberland, Coastal Cumberland,
Coastal Waldo, Coastal York, Interior Cumberland Highlands,
Interior Waldo, Interior York, Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln, Sagadahoc,
Southern Franklin, Southern Oxford and Southern Somerset. Portions
of New Hampshire, including the following areas, Belknap,
Cheshire, Coastal Rockingham, Eastern Hillsborough, Interior
Rockingham, Merrimack, Northern Carroll, Northern Grafton,
Southern Carroll, Southern Grafton, Strafford, Sullivan and
Western And Central Hillsborough.
* WHEN...Through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Expect widespread overland flooding that could cause disruptions
to travel.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Warm temperatures and heavy rain will support rapid snowmelt
which will add around an inch of additional runoff. Frozen
ground and snow blocked drainage will exacerbate flooding
conditions. The total combined runoff will cause rapid rises
on small streams and creeks which could produce locally
significant flooding.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
