<instruction>A Wind Chill Warning means the combination of very cold air and
strong winds will create dangerously low wind chill values. This
will result in frost bite and lead to hypothermia or death if
precautions are not taken.
Avoid outside activities if possible. When outside, make sure you
wear appropriate clothing, a hat, and gloves.
A Winter Weather Advisory for snow means that periods of snow
and blowing snow will cause travel difficulties. Be prepared for
snow covered roads and limited visibilities...and use caution
while driving.
The latest road conditions for the state you are calling from can
