* WHAT...For the Wind Chill Warning, dangerously cold wind

* IMPACTS...Plan on snow and ice covered roads. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous travel

chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 30
minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The snow combined with the increasing wind,
sharply falling temperatures and initially wet roads may lead to
a flash freeze and extremely dangerous travel conditions.</description>

layers and cover exposed skin. Wear a hat and gloves. Frostbite
and hypothermia can occur within minutes if precautions are not
taken.
