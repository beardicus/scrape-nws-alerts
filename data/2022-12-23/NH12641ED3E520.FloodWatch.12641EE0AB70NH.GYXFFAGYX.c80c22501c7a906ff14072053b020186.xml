<headline>Flood Watch issued December 23 at 6:28PM EST until December 24 at 2:00AM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>.A powerful storm which brought a broad swath of moderate to heavy
rainfall to the region is lifting through northern New England with
temperatures quickly crashing below freezing in its wake. While
freezing temperatures will cease or slow overland runoff, runoff
from rain and snowmelt through streams and waterways will continue
through the next several hours into Saturday. The flash flooding
threat has ended with heavy rainfall moving out of the area. The
overland flooding threat has peaked, although low-lying and other
poorly-drained areas make take several hours for waters to recede.
Snowpack has absorbed much of the rain in the mountains, however
much of the snowpack through the interior has melted off into local
waterways which are currently seeing significant rises. Flashiest
basins will peak tonight... while larger stems will see rises into
tomorrow. Minor flooding is occuring on many of the smaller streams
and rivers in the meantime. Cold temperatures on the backside of the
storm system could cause flooded areas to freeze in place.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flash, urban, and small stream flooding expected from
widespread heavy rain and snowmelt.
* WHERE...Portions of Maine, including the following areas, Central
Somerset, Northern Franklin and Northern Oxford. Portions of
northern New Hampshire, including the following area, Southern
Coos.
* WHEN...Through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Overland flooding could cause disruptions to travel.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A storm system has brought 1 to 3 inches of rainfall with
locally higher amounts in the higher terrain. Area snowpack
has captured some of the rainfall to dampen the runoff,
however sufficient runoff has occurred to cause rapid rises
on small streams and creeks. Frozen ground and snow blocked
drainage will exacerbate flooding conditions.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Travel in and out of the region could be disrupted due to
flooding. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
