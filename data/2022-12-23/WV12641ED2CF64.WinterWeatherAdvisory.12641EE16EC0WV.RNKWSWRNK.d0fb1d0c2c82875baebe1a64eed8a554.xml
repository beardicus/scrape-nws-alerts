strong winds will create dangerously low wind chill values. This
will result in frost bite and lead to hypothermia or death if
precautions are not taken.
Avoid outside activities if possible. When outside, make sure
you wear appropriate clothing, a hat, and gloves.
A Winter Weather Advisory for snow means that periods of snow
will cause travel difficulties. Be prepared for snow covered
roads and limited visibilities...and use caution while driving.
