<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 23 at 7:41AM EST until December 23 at 3:00PM EST by NWS State College</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 PM EST THIS
AFTERNOON...
...WIND CHILL WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Wind Chill Warning, dangerously cold wind
chills expected. Wind chills as low as 35 below zero. For the
Winter Weather Advisory, snow expected. Total snow
accumulations of up to two inches. Winds gusting as high as 45
mph.
* WHERE...Sullivan County.
* WHEN...For the Wind Chill Warning, until 7 PM EST Saturday.
For the Winter Weather Advisory, until 3 PM EST this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the latter half of the morning and
perhaps linger into the early evening commute. Gusty winds could
bring down tree branches and cause scattered power outages. The
cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as
little as 30 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The snow combined with the increasing
wind, sharply falling temperatures and initially wet roads may
lead to a flash freeze and extremely dangerous travel
conditions.</description>
<instruction>Avoid going outside during the coldest parts of the day. Dress in
layers and cover exposed skin. Wear a hat and gloves. Frostbite
and hypothermia can occur within minutes if precautions are not
taken.
