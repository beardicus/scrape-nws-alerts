<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued December 23 at 11:22AM EST until December 23 at 1:00PM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM EST THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...One to two and a half feet, locally 3 ft of inundation
above ground level expected in vulnerable areas near the
waterfront and shoreline. The water will peak shortly and will
subside by mid afternoon.
* WHERE...In Connecticut, Southern Fairfield County. In New
York, Southern Westchester County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, from 8 AM to 1 PM EST
Friday.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Widespread moderate to localized major
flooding of vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline
is becoming likely, with 1 to 2 1/2 feet, locally 3 ft, of
inundation above ground level in low lying, vulnerable areas.
This would result in numerous road closures and cause
widespread flooding of low lying property including parking
lots, parks, lawns and homes/businesses with basements near
the waterfront. A few buildings and homes near the waterfront
could experience flooding. Vehicles parked in vulnerable areas
near the waterfront will likely become flooded. Flooding could
also extend inland from the waterfront along tidal rivers and
bays.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...3 to 5 ft breaking waves, particularly
facing Central Long Island Sound, will result in beach erosion
and erosion of dune structures. Wave splashover of dune
structures and bulkheads is possible in spots, which would cause
flooding of roadways and vulnerable structures behind protective
structures and locally major inundation impacts.</description>

travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.</instruction>
