on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Multiple observations in northeast Ohio
and northwest Pennsylvania have reported near-zero
visibilities. The combination of falling snow, blowing snow,
and strong winds will continue to create blizzard conditions
through tonight. From today through Sunday, a period of almost
48 hours where temperatures remain in the single digits. This
combined with the strong winds would allow for a long period
of wind chills well below zero. Temperatures this cold for an
extended period of time will impact infrastructure across the
region with frozen pipes a concern.</description>
