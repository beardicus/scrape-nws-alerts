<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued December 23 at 4:36PM EST until December 24 at 1:00AM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM EST SATURDAY...

vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...Southwest Suffolk and Southeast Suffolk Counties,
particularly Bellport eastward through Westhampton Beach and
Quogue
* WHEN...Until 1 AM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Minor coastal flooding is likely in the most
vulnerable locations near the waterfront and shoreline, with up
to 1 feet of inundation above ground level in low lying,
vulnerable areas. Some roads and low lying property including
parking lots, parks, lawns and homes/businesses with basements
near the waterfront will experience shallow flooding.

thresholds across eastern Great South Bay during this evening
high tide in response to strong southwest winds trapping water

final high tide of concern.</description>

closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
