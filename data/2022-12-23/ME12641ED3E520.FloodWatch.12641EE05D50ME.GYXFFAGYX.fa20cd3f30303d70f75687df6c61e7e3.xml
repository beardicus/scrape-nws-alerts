<headline>Flood Watch issued December 23 at 6:28PM EST until December 24 at 12:00AM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>.A powerful storm which brought a broad swath of moderate to heavy
rainfall to the region is lifting through northern New England with
temperatures quickly crashing below freezing in its wake. While
freezing temperatures will cease or slow overland runoff, runoff
from rain and snowmelt through streams and waterways will continue
through the next several hours into Saturday. The flash flooding
threat has ended with heavy rainfall moving out of the area. The
overland flooding threat has peaked, although low-lying and other
poorly-drained areas make take several hours for waters to recede.
Snowpack has absorbed much of the rain in the mountains, however
much of the snowpack through the interior has melted off into local
waterways which are currently seeing significant rises. Flashiest
basins will peak tonight... while larger stems will see rises into
tomorrow. Minor flooding is occuring on many of the smaller streams
and rivers in the meantime. Cold temperatures on the backside of the
storm system could cause flooded areas to freeze in place.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flash, urban, and small stream flooding expected from
widespread heavy rain and snowmelt.
* WHERE...Portions of Maine, including the following areas,
Androscoggin, Central Interior Cumberland, Coastal Cumberland,
Coastal Waldo, Coastal York, Interior Cumberland Highlands,
Interior Waldo, Interior York, Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln, Sagadahoc,
Southern Franklin, Southern Oxford and Southern Somerset. Portions
of New Hampshire, including the following areas, Belknap, Coastal
Rockingham, Eastern Hillsborough, Interior Rockingham, Merrimack,
Northern Carroll, Northern Grafton, Southern Carroll, Southern
Grafton, Strafford and Western And Central Hillsborough.
* WHEN...Through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Expect widespread overland flooding that could cause disruptions
to travel.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Warm temperatures and heavy rain has resulted in rapid
snowmelt contributing to additional runoff. Frozen ground and
snow blocked drainage will exacerbate flooding conditions.
The total combined runoff will continue to cause rapid rises
on small streams and creeks which could produce locally
significant flooding.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
