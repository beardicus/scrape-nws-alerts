<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued December 23 at 11:22AM EST until December 23 at 1:00PM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM EST THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Two to three feet of inundation above ground level in
vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline. The water
will peaking shortly and will subside by mid afternoon.
* WHERE...Northeast Suffolk, Southwest Suffolk and Southeast
Suffolk Counties.
* WHEN...From 3 AM to 1 PM EST Friday.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Widespread moderate to localized major
flooding of vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline
is becoming likely, with 1 to 2 1/2 feet, locally 3 ft, of
inundation above ground level in low lying, vulnerable areas.
This would result in numerous road closures and cause
widespread flooding of low lying property including parking
lots, parks, lawns and homes/businesses with basements near
the waterfront. A few buildings and homes near the waterfront
could experience flooding. Vehicles parked in vulnerable areas
near the waterfront will likely become flooded. Flooding could
also extend inland from the waterfront along tidal rivers and
bays.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...Along the ocean front, 10 to 15 ft
breakers (highest across eastern Long Island) will likely
result in widespread beach flooding and erosion during the
times of high tide. Areas of dune base erosion and localized
overwashes are likely as well. Along the south shore of the
north fork of Long Island, particularly Orient Point, 3 to 6
ft breaking waves will result in beach erosion and erosion of
dune structures. Wave splashover of dune structures and
bulkheads is possible in spots, which would cause flooding of
roadways and vulnerable structures behind protective
structures.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...There is potential for lingering minor to
locally moderate coastal flooding in the eastern Great South
Bay this afternoon/evening ahead of tonight`s high tide in
response to a strong wind shift sloshing trapped water to the
eastern portion of Great South Bay for the Fri eve high tidal
cycle.</description>
