<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued December 23 at 2:07AM EST until December 24 at 10:00AM EST by NWS Melbourne</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE SATURDAY NIGHT...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding.
For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Mainland Northern Brevard and Mainland Southern
Brevard Counties.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 10 AM Saturday.
For the High Rip Current Risk, through late Saturday night.
* IMPACTS...Some flooding of low-lying lots, parks and roadways
may occur near the shoreline. Only isolated road closures are
expected. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water. Entering the surf is not
recommended.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Coastal flooding is expected to occur with
the morning high tide cycle this morning and again Saturday and
Sunday mornings. As a result, an extension may be needed beyond
Saturday morning.</description>
<instruction>Above normal tides will generate flooding of low areas along the
shore. Do not drive around barricades or through water of unknown
depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as jetties and
piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.</instruction>
