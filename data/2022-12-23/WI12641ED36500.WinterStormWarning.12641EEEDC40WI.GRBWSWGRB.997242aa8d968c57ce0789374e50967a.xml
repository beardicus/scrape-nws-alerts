<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued December 23 at 2:00PM CST until December 24 at 6:00PM CST by NWS GreenBay</headline>
<description>...VERY WINDY WITH BLOWING AND DRIFTING SNOW TONIGHT AND SATURDAY...
.Low pressure over southern Ontario will continue to intensify as it
tracks north towards western Quebec on Saturday. Bands of light snow
wrapping around the western flank of the storm will affect mainly
eastern Wisconsin from time to time, and lake-effect snow will
increase in the Lake Superior snowbelt of northern Wisconsin.
However, the main impact from the storm will be widespread blowing
and drifting snow, caused by strong northwest winds. The wind will
drive wind chills to 15 below to 35 below zero.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM CST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow, blowing and drifting snow, and low wind chills.
Additional snow accumulations from 8 to 14 inches in the snowbelt,
to 4 to 8 inches elsewhere. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph. Wind
chills 15 below to 25 below zero.
* WHERE...Vilas County.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible at times,
especially in open areas. The combination of wind and cold could
result in exposed skin suffering frostbite in as little as 15
minutes.</description>

your vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road conditions for
