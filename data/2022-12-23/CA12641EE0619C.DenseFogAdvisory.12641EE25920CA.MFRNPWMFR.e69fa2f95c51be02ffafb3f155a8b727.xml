<headline>Dense Fog Advisory issued December 23 at 9:11PM PST until December 24 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...DENSE FOG ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Dense fog with visibility of a quarter mile or less.
* WHERE...In California, portions of the Shasta, Scott, and Lower
Klamath River Valley.
In Oregon, portions of the Rogue, Illinois, and Umpqua Valleys.
* WHEN...Until 10 AM PST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous driving conditions due to low visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The fog is just starting to become dense
and is expected to expand overnight. As of 910 PM PST it is
most dense between Medford &amp; Central Point, and heading SW out
of Grants Pass along route 199.
For other areas like the Shasta Valley and Umpqua Valley, the
fog is more impactful as you go up in elevation along I-5.
An incoming front may lift the fog before 10 AM; we will
continue to monitor for necessary updates.
* View the hazard area in detail at
https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/map/?wfo=mfr</description>
<instruction>* Slow down and allow for plenty of room between you and other
vehicles.
* Fog makes objects appear farther away than they are
* Use low beams. High beams reflect back thick fog, making
visibility worse for you and other drivers.
* Be prepared. Keep your headlights clean. That way, you`re
ready for low-visibility conditions
* Don`t use cruise control. Most crashes occur because the
driver is going too fast for weather conditions.</instruction>
