<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued December 23 at 3:49AM EST until December 24 at 1:00AM EST by NWS Caribou</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM THIS MORNING
TO 1 AM EST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Up to one to two feet of inundation above ground level
possible in low-lying areas near shorelines. The greatest
concern for coastal flooding is around the time of high tides
near 10 am Friday and Friday night between 10 pm and 11:30 pm.
Large battering waves will lead to significant splashover at
both tides. This may cause damage to roadways along the coast
and erosion with both tides..
* WHERE...Coastal Hancock and Coastal Washington Counties.
* WHEN...From 9 AM this morning to 1 AM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Numerous roads may be closed. Low lying property
including homes, businesses, and some critical infrastructure
may be inundated.
* WAVE IMPACTS...Expect moderate beach erosion at locations such
as Rogue Bluffs due to large breaking waves. Rocks associated
with splashover may wash across exposed coastal roads,
resulting in road closures and damage to passing vehicles.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.</instruction>
