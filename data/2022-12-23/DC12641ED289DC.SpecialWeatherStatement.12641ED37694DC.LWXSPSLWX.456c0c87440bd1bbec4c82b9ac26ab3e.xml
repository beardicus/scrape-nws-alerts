<description>...ARCTIC FRONT MOVING THROUGH REGION RESULTING IN RAPIDLY
FREEZING CONDITIONS...
At 930 AM, an Arctic cold front was passing across the
metropolitan areas of Baltimore and Washington and the Interstate
95 corridor. Winds have shifted to the west and are gusting to 35
MPH in many locations. The frigid arctic cold air is lagging
behind the front by a couple of hours. Conditions will deteriorate
rapidly with the the increase in wind coupled with the decrease
in temperatures.
Temperatures have begun to drop this morning across much of the
area. By early afternoon, temperatures will be below freezing
across the entire region, and by late afternoon, the region will
be 20F degrees or below, producing wind chills at or below zero
by sunset.
This temperature drop will cause any standing water or moisture on
untreated surfaces to rapidly freeze. Be especially aware of
parking lots, side streets. When venturing outside, watch your first
few steps taken on steps, sidewalks, and driveways, which could
be icy and slippery, increasing your risk of a fall and injury.
Be prepared for slippery roads when travelling, any surfaces that
appear to be wet may be icy.
Check on the elderly. Pets and livestock should be accounted for
and protected. Locking mechanisms on vehicles and windshield wiper
may freeze up, so take extra time for preparation if you must
travel today.</description>
