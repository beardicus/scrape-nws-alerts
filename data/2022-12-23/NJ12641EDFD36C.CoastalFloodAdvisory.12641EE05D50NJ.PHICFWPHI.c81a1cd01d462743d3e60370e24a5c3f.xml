<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued December 23 at 8:47PM EST until December 24 at 12:00AM EST by NWS Philadelphia - Mount Holly</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EST TONIGHT...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IS CANCELLED...
* WHAT...Up to one foot of inundation above ground level in low-
lying areas.
* WHERE...Ocean and Coastal Ocean.
* WHEN...Until midnight EST tonight.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Water levels have dropped below flood stage
across the oceanfront and inlets. As a result, the coastal flood
warnings have been allowed to expire for these areas. The
exception is Barnegat Bay. Because of the onshore flow we saw
ahead of the Arctic cold front earlier today, the bay is still
draining slowly. As a result, up to one foot of inundation above
ground level can still be expected across low-lying areas as we
move through the evening.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
