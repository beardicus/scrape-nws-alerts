<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued December 23 at 10:38AM CST until December 24 at 6:00PM CST by NWS GreenBay</headline>
<description>...VERY WINDY WITH BLOWING AND DRIFTING SNOW TODAY AND TONIGHT...
.Low pressure will continue to intensify over southern Ontario today
and tonight. Bands of light snow wrapping around the western flank
of the storm will affect mainly eastern Wisconsin from time to time,
and Lake-effect snow will increase in the Lake Superior snowbelt of
northern Wisconsin. But the main impact of the storm will be
widespread blowing and drifting snow cause by strong northwest
winds. The wind will drive wind chills to 15 below to 40 below zero.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM CST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow, blowing and drifting snow, and low wind chills.
Additional snow accumulations from 8 to 15 inches in the snowbelt,
to 4 to 8 inches elsewhere. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph. Wind
chills 15 below to 30 below zero.
* WHERE...Vilas County.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible at times,
especially in open areas. The combination of wind and cold could
result in exposed skin suffering frostbite in as little as 15
minutes.</description>
<instruction>If possible, consider postponing travel until conditions improve. If
you must travel during this period, drive with extreme caution.
Consider taking a winter storm kit along with you, including such
items as tire chains, booster cables, flashlight, shovel, blankets
and extra clothing. Also take water, a first aid kit, and anything
else that would help you survive in case you become stranded. Be
sure your vehicle has sufficient fuel before crossing open areas.</instruction>
