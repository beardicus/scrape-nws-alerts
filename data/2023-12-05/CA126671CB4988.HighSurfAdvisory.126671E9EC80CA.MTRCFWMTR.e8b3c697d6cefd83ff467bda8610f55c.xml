<headline>High Surf Advisory issued December 05 at 3:22AM PST until December 07 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM THIS EVENING TO 4 AM
PST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, increased risk of
sneaker waves expected. For the High Surf Advisory, large
breaking waves of 18 to 22 feet.
* WHERE...San Francisco, Coastal North Bay Including Point Reyes
National Seashore, San Francisco Peninsula Coast and Southern
Monterey Bay and Big Sur Coast Counties.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, through this evening.
For the High Surf Advisory, from 7 PM this evening to 4 AM PST
Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Large waves can sweep across the beach
without warning, pulling people into the sea from rocks,
jetties, and beaches. These waves can also move large objects
such as logs, crushing anyone caught underneath.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Large northwest waves will peak Wednesday
morning. Northwest facing beaches are most at risk for large
turbulent shore break and strong currents.</description>
<instruction>Large breaking waves along the coast will lead to increased run-
up on beaches with waves topping and washing over large rocks and
jetties. These large waves can be erratic and unpredictable. Use
extra caution near the surf zone as these large waves will be
capable of sweeping people into the water. Avoid rocks and
jetties. Avoid steep beaches. Stay much farther back from the
water and never turn your back on the ocean.</instruction>
