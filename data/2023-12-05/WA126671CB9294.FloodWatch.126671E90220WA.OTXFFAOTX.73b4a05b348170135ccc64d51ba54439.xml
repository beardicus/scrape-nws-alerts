<description>.Moderate to heavy rain and melting snow will lead to rises on

quickly and reach critical levels. Low lying areas with poor
drainage may see flooding impacts as well.

* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt continues to be

* WHERE...A portion of North Central Washington, including the
following county, Chelan.
* WHEN...Through Wednesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations. An
increase risk for rock slides in steep terrain is possible as well.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A moderately strong atmospheric river event through Wednesday
