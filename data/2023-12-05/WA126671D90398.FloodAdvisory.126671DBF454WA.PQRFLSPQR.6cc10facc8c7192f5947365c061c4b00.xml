<senderName>NWS Portland (Northwest Oregon and Southwest Washington)</senderName>
<headline>Flood Advisory issued December 05 at 5:18PM PST until further notice by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM PST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Urban and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall continues.
* WHERE...Much of southwest Washington and northwest Oregon,
excluding the high Cascades, mid-Columbia Gorge and Hood River
Valley.
* WHEN...Until 100 AM PST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Many small streams and creeks will continue running full
with minor flooding expected through Wednesday. In addition, minor
flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas will continue. Some
low-water crossings may become impassable. Ponding of water in
urban or other areas is occurring or is imminent. Areas most
likely to see such flooding will be the coast, coast mountains,
and the I-5 corridor from Portland northward through the Cowlitz
River Valley.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 507 PM PST, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated heavy rain. This will cause urban and small stream
flooding. Overflowing poor drainage areas will cause minor
flooding in the advisory area. Between 2 and 8 inches of rain
have fallen.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches are expected
over the area. This additional rain will result in minor
flooding. In addition, areas with poor drainage, such as
railroad crossings and underpasses, will quickly see standing
water.

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.</instruction>
