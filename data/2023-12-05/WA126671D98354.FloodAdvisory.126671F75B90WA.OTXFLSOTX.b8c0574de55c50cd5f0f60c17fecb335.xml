<headline>Flood Advisory issued December 05 at 8:45PM PST until December 07 at 4:04PM PST by NWS Spokane</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM PST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Urban and small stream flooding caused by rain and snowmelt
continues.
* WHERE...Portions of North Idaho, including the following counties,
Bonner, Boundary, Kootenai and Shoshone and Northeast Washington,
including the following counties, Pend Oreille and Stevens.
* WHEN...Until 400 AM PST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
River or stream flows are elevated.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 833 PM PST, Doppler radar and rain gauges indicated
significant rainfall over the northern Idaho Panhandle and
the mountainous terrain of northeast Washington. Between 1
and 2.5 inches of rain have fallen. The rain on top of
melting snow will lead to flooding in areas that drain poorly
as well as rises on creeks and small streams.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 0.5 to 1.5 inches are expected
over the area. This additional rain will result in minor
flooding. Mud and rockslides in steep terrain will be a
potential impact as the soil becomes increasingly saturated.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Coeur d`Alene, Post Falls, Hayden, Sandpoint, Rathdrum,
Bonners Ferry, Dalton Gardens, Kellogg, Priest River,
Pinehurst, Osburn, Wallace, Colville, Chewelah, Newport,
Spirit Lake, Ponderay, Moyie Springs, Athol and Mullan.
- Colville River, Pack River, Pink Creek, Nine Mile Creek, and
Lightning Creek
