<headline>High Surf Advisory issued December 05 at 3:17PM PST until December 06 at 11:00AM PST by NWS Eureka</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM PST THIS
AFTERNOON...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 AM PST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves up to
24 ft. For the Beach Hazards Statement, increased threat of
sneaker waves expected.
* WHERE...Coastal Del Norte, Northern Humboldt Coast,
Southwestern Humboldt and Mendocino Coast Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 11 AM PST Wednesday.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, until 4 PM PST this
afternoon.. .
* IMPACTS...Dangerous surfing conditions and localized beach
erosion. Beachcombing is highly discouraged! Large, unexpected
waves can sweep across the beach without warning, sweeping
people into the sea from rocks, jetties, and beaches. These
sneaker waves can also move large objects such as logs,
crushing anyone caught underneath.</description>
<instruction>Large breaking waves along the coast will lead to increased wave
run-up on beaches with waves topping and washing over large rocks
and jetties. These large waves can be erratic and unpredictable.
Use extra caution near the surf zone as these large waves will be
capable of sweeping people into the frigid and turbulent ocean
water. Mariners traversing the bar are urged to exercise extreme
caution or stay in port until the threat subsides. Please contact
the U.S. Coast Guard for information regarding harbor and bar
closures.
Don`t be fooled by an ocean that looks calm. There can be 30
minutes of small waves before a sneaker wave strikes. Avoid rocks
and jetties. Avoid steep beaches. Stay much farther back from the
water and never turn your back on the ocean.</instruction>
