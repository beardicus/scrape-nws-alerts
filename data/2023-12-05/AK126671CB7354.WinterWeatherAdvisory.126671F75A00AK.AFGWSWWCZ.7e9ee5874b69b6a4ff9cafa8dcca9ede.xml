<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 05 at 3:29AM AKST until December 07 at 3:00PM AKST by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT TONIGHT TO
3 PM AKST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches.
North winds gusting as high as 55 mph.
* WHERE...Diomede and Bering Strait Coast.
* WHEN...From midnight tonight to 3 PM AKST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...There will be 2 separate rounds of snow.
The first round is tonight into Wednesday morning with a front
that will bring widespread steady snow which may be heavy at
times with gusty winds. Then the next will be numerous snow
squalls which begin Wednesday night. Blowing snow with bursts of
heavy snow will be the main concern as visibility will quickly
drop to 1/2 mile or less in these squalls resulting in
significant travel disruptions. These squalls look to stick
around through at least Thursday. Several additional inches of
snow is expected from snow squalls this weekend as well.</description>
