<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 PM PST THIS
AFTERNOON...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO
10 AM PST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...An extended period of sustained wave action is expected
to continue through Wednesday morning as a series of fronts
moves through the region, culminating in a period of very large
breaking waves of 25 to 30 feet this afternoon into early
Wednesday morning.
* WHERE...South Central Oregon Coast and Curry County Coast.
* WHEN...The Beach Hazards Statement is in effect until 2 PM PST
this afternoon, with a High Surf Advisory from 2 PM this
afternoon to 10 AM PST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Beaches will be hazardous places to be through the
middle of the week. Jetties and rocks are not safe places to
stand, and you will risk death if you are caught by waves on
them. Beach erosion is possible. Sneaker waves can run up
significantly farther on beaches than normal, including over
rocks and jetties. These waves can suddenly knock people off
of their feet and quickly pull them into the cold ocean
waters, resulting in serious injury or death. Waves may also
lift driftwood logs, trapping anyone caught underneath.

<instruction>Stay away from the surf zone and off of jetties. Area beaches may
become hazardous due to dangerous surf conditions.
Avoid climbing on rocks and jetties. Stay away from the ocean and
remain out of the water to avoid hazardous conditions.</instruction>
