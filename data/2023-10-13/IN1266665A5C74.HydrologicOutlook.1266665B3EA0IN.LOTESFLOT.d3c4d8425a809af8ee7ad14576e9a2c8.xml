<description>...Multiple Rounds of Soaking Rain with Localized Threat for
Flooding This Afternoon through Saturday Morning...
A strong fall weather system will bring periods of soaking rain to
the area through Saturday morning. Repeated rounds of rain over the
same area with limited time for runoff and infiltration into the
soil may lead to localized flooding of low-lying and urban areas, as
well as streams and creeks. This includes areas that already
received 1 to 3 inches of rain on Wednesday. The main localized
flooding threat area through early Saturday is for locations near
and north of the Illinois and Kankakee Rivers.
This outlook means that elevated water levels and potential impacts
are possible. Stay up to date on the latest forecasts including the
possibility of flood watches, warnings, and advisories.</description>
