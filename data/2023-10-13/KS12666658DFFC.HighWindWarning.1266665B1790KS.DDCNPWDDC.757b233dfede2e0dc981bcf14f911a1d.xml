Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Minor structural damage is possible. Isolated power
outages are possible. Travel will be difficult, especially for
high profile vehicles. Areas of blowing dust will limit
visibility at times. Frost and freeze conditions could kill
crops, other sensitive vegetation and possibly damage
unprotected outdoor plumbing.</description>
<instruction>Areas of blowing dust and strong cross winds will make driving
difficult to dangerous at times. Motorists of high profile
vehicles should use extreme caution. Some limited structural
damage is possible.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
