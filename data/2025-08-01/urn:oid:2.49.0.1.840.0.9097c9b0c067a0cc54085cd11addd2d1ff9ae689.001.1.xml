        <description>* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.

* WHERE...The lower Matanuska River near Butte and Palmer as well as
small rivers and streams between Sutton and Eureka.

* WHEN...From 7 PM AKDT this evening through Monday afternoon.

* IMPACTS...Heavy rainfall will lead to rapid runoff and rises in
small streams draining the steep terrain along the Glenn Highway
between Sutton and Eureka. Landslides are possible in
landslide-prone areas along this corridor. Significant runoff is
also expected to raise water levels on the Matanuska River, with
some locations approaching bankfull by early Sunday morning. River
levels may approach or even exceed those observed in early July,
with increased bank erosion expected along the lower Matanuska
River. While water levels may rise in small streams and rivers
across the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, flooding is not expected west
of the lower Matanuska River.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rainfall is expected to move from east to west across the
Copper River Basin beginning tonight and lasting through
Sunday morning. Projected rainfall totals with this storm are
likely around 1 to 2 inches from Mendeltna to Sutton.
Precipitation will become enhanced near terrain and along the
northeast facing slopes of the Talkeetna and Chugach
mountains. The heaviest rainfall is expected within the
mountainous terrain along the Glenn Highway corridor between
Sutton and Eureka. Ponding of water on roadways and erosion
of unpaved surfaces is also possible.

The Matanuska River at Palmer (MATA2) is expected to crest
Sunday morning at 25100 cfs, which is below minor flood stage
(30000 cfs).

- If you live near or along the Matanuska River, stay alert and be
prepared to take action.
- All residents on or near mountain slopes should be prepared for
possible landslides.

        <instruction>Persons living along streams should stay alert and be prepared to
take action if a warning or advisory is issued, or flooding is
observed.

You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.

Stay tuned to further developments by listening to your local radio,
television, or NOAA Weather Radio for further information.
