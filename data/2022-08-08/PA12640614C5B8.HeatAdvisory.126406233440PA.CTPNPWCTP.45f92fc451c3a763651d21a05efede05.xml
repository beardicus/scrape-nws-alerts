<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay out of the sun, and stay in an
air-conditioned room. Check up on relatives and neighbors, and
provide pets with adequate water and shelter from the sun.
Young children and pets should never be left unattended in
vehicles under any circumstances. This is especially true
during hot weather when car interiors can reach lethal
temperatures in a matter of minutes. LOOK BEFORE YOU LOCK.
If you work or spend time outside, reschedule strenuous
activities to early morning or evening. Know the signs and
symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Wear lightweight
and loose fitting clothing.
To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.
For excessive heat safety information, visit heat.gov or weather.gov/heat.

NWS State College Facebook page and Twitter @NWSStateCollege,
