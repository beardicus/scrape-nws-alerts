<headline>Red Flag Warning issued August 08 at 3:28AM PDT until August 09 at 9:00PM PDT by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...Periods of Critical Conditions Expected Across Portions of
Southern Oregon and Northern California...
.The next couple of days will see periods of critical conditions
consisting of strong gusty wind and low RH today for portions of
Siskiyou County as well as thunderstorms capable of producing
frequent lightning in scattered showers along and east of the
Cascades. While the thunderstorms will likely become isolated
overnight tonight, they are expected to pick up in activity once
again on Tuesday. Additional periods of gusty winds and low
humidities will also be possible on Tuesday for portions of
Siskiyou and Jackson Counties.
...RED FLAG WARNING NOW IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM MONDAY TO 9 PM PDT
TUESDAY FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR PORTIONS OF FIRE
WEATHER ZONES 623...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
TUESDAY EVENING FOR STRONG GUSTY WIND WITH LOW RH FOR PORTIONS OF
FIRE WEATHER ZONE 623...
* Impacts: In southern zone 623, strong, gusty wind with low
relative humidity and critically dry vegetation will greatly
increase the spread potential of any new and existing fires. In
northern zone 623, lightning and very dry vegetation will likely
result in new fire starts. Gusty thunderstorm winds could
contribute to fire spread. Despite rainfall, initial attack
resources could be overwhelmed and holdover fires are possible.
* Affected area:
The Red Flag Warning for abundant lightning covers northern Fire
Weather Zone 623, along and north of Highway 62.
The Fire Weather Watch for gusty winds and low RH covers southern
Fire Weather Zone 623, along and south of Howard Prairie.
* Wind: South 10 to 15 mph with gusts up to 30 mph. Near
thunderstorms, quickly shifting winds could reach up to 50 mph.
* Humidity: As low as 10 percent.
* Thunderstorms: Thunderstorm activity will likely begin by mid-
afternoon Monday with the most active period likely in the late
afternoon and evening. Activity could linger at night and into
Tuesday, shifting east and north with time. Storms will also
become wetter by Tuesday.

Precautionary Preparedness Actions...
Avoid tossing burning cigarettes on the ground, parking hot
vehicles on dry vegetation, and using equipment that can cause
sparks. Follow all fire restrictions. Find links to restrictions
at weather.gov/medford/wildfire. One less spark, one less
wildfire.
Gather your fire evacuation kit now. Collect essentials you don`t
want to lose and prioritize your checklist. Visit ready.gov/kit
for more information.
Familiarize yourself with your evacuation plan. Where will you go?
How will you get there? Who will you call to let others know your
are safe? Visit ready.gov/wildfires for more information.
A Red Flag Warning does not mean there is a fire. It means that
critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now or will
shortly. These conditions promote rapid spread of fire which may
become life threatening. Evacuate if ordered to, or if a fire
threatens.</description>
