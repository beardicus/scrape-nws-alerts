scar. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar may result in debris flow
moving through the Middle Creek, Vega Creek, Wagon Creek, Indian
Creek and Rilling Creek. The debris flow can consist of rock, mud,
vegetation and other loose materials.

flash flooding in and around the Spring Burn Scar.

deaths occur in vehicles.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
