WEATHER ZONE 624...
The National Weather Service in Medford has cancelled the Fire

The threat area for thunderstorms shifts a bit more to the north
and east on Tuesday.
* Wind: South 10 to 15 mph with gusts up to 30 mph on Tuesday.
* Humidity: As low as 10 percent on Tuesday.
* Thunderstorms: Thunderstorm activity will likely begin by mid-
afternoon Monday with the most active period likely in the late
afternoon and evening. Activity could linger at night and into
Tuesday, shifting east and north with time. Storms will also
become wetter by Tuesday.
* Additional Details: Despite the thunderstorm lifting to the
north and east with time on Tuesday, critical conditions are
expected to shift from the thunderstorm threat to that of gusty
winds and low RH for southwestern portion of zone 624 including
Klamath Falls and surrounding areas on Tuesday.

Precautionary/preparedness actions...
Avoid tossing burning cigarettes on the ground, parking hot
vehicles on dry vegetation, and using equipment that can cause
sparks. Follow all fire restrictions. Find links to restrictions
at weather.gov/medford/wildfire. One less spark, one less
wildfire.
Gather your fire evacuation kit now. Collect essentials you don`t
want to lose and prioritize your checklist. Visit ready.gov/kit
for more information.
Familiarize yourself with your evacuation plan. Where will you go?
How will you get there? Who will you call to let others know your
are safe? Visit ready.gov/wildfires for more information.
A Red Flag Warning does not mean there is a fire. It means that
critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now or will
shortly. These conditions promote rapid spread of fire which may
become life threatening. Evacuate if ordered to, or if a fire
threatens.
