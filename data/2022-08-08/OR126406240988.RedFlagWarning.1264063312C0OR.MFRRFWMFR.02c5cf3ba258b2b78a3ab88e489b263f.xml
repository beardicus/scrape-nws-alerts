<headline>Red Flag Warning issued August 08 at 10:46PM PDT until August 09 at 9:00PM PDT by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM PDT TUESDAY FOR
ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONE 623 AND
PORTIONS OF FIRE WEATHER ZONE 617...
* Impacts: Lightning and very dry vegetation will likely result in
new fire starts. Gusty thunderstorm winds could contribute to fire
spread. Despite rainfall, initial attack resources could be
overwhelmed and holdover fires are possible. In southern zone 623,
strong, gusty wind with low relative humidity and critically dry
vegetation could also greatly increase the spread potential of any
new and existing fires Tuesday afternoon and evening.
* Affected area:
In Southwest OR...Fire Weather Zones 617 near and east of Toketee
Falls and all of Fire Weather Zone 623.
* Wind: West 10 to 15 mph with gusts to 25 mph, except south 10 to
15 mph with gusts to 30 mph in southern fire weather zone 623.
Near thunderstorms, quickly shifting winds up to 50 mph are
possible.
* Humidity: as low as 10 percent in southern fire zone 623; as low
as 15 percent elsewhere.
* Thunderstorms: Thunderstorms will increase through this evening.
Activity could linger tonight and into Tuesday, shifting east
and north with time. Storms will also become wetter by Tuesday.
