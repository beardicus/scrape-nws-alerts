<headline>Red Flag Warning issued August 08 at 9:41PM PDT until August 10 at 6:00AM PDT by NWS Pendleton</headline>
<description>...SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS WITH ABUNDANT LIGHTNING POSSIBLE
MONDAY AND TUESDAY FOR CENTRAL OREGON AND OREGON CASCADES...
.A low pressure system over the eastern Pacific Ocean will lift
slowly along the coast and usher moisture into the region. The
combination of the moisture and daytime heating will produce
isolated to scattered thunderstorms over portions of Central
Oregon this afternoon and through Tuesday night. The
thunderstorms are expected to expand in coverage Tuesday although
the storms may be wetter. However, confidence is not high enough
that storms will be wet enough to offset lightning and outflow
threat. Gusty winds from thunderstorms may further aggravate any
fire spread.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM TUESDAY TO 6 AM
PDT WEDNESDAY FOR WIND AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR FIRE WEATHER
ZONE OR610...
* AFFECTED AREA...Fire Weather Zone 610 East Slopes of Central
Oregon Cascades.
* IMPACTS...Lightning and high fire danger will likely result in
new fire starts. Gusty thunderstorm winds could contribute to
fire spread. Despite rainfall, initial attack resources could
be overwhelmed and holdover fires are possible.
* THUNDERSTORMS...Scattered thunderstorm activity is expected to
start Tuesday afternoon. The storms may linger overnight into
early morning Wednesday. Storms may be wet in nature, but
lightning and storm outflow may offset the potential for
wetting rains. Lightning Activity level around 3 expected.
* OUTFLOW WINDS...Outflow wind gusts near thunderstorms could
approach 30 to 40 mph.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now....or will shortly. A combination of
strong winds...low relative humidity...and warm temperatures can
contribute to extreme fire behavior.</instruction>
