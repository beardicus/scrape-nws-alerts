<headline>Red Flag Warning issued August 08 at 9:18AM PDT until August 09 at 9:00PM PDT by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...Periods of Critical Conditions Expected Across Portions of
Southern Oregon and Northern California...
.The next couple of days will see periods of critical conditions
consisting of strong gusty wind and low RH today for portions of
Siskiyou County as well as thunderstorms capable of producing
frequent lightning in scattered showers along and east of the
Cascades. While activity could lessen, thunderstorms
could continue overnight, then increase in coverage once
again on Tuesday. Additional periods of gusty winds and low
humidities will also be possible on Tuesday for portions of
Siskiyou and Jackson Counties.
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO 9 PM PDT
TUESDAY FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONE
284...
The National Weather Service in Medford has upgraded the Fire
Weather Watch to a Red Flag Warning...which is in effect from 2 PM
this afternoon to 9 PM PDT Tuesday.
* Impacts: Lightning and very dry vegetation will likely result in
new fire starts. Gusty thunderstorm winds could contribute to fire
spread. Despite rainfall, initial attack resources could be
overwhelmed and holdover fires are possible. In western portions
of zone 284, strong, gusty wind with low relative humidity and
critically dry vegetation could also greatly increase the spread
potential of any new and existing fires Tuesday afternoon and
evening.
* Affected area: In Northern CA...Fire Weather Zone 284.
* Wind: South 10 to 20 mph with gusts up to 30 mph. Near
thunderstorms, quickly shifting winds to 50 mph are possible.
* Thunderstorms: Thunderstorm activity will likely begin mid to late
this afternoon with the most active period this evening. Activity
could linger tonight and into Tuesday, shifting east and north with
time. Storms will also become wetter by Tuesday.
* Humidity: 10 to 15 percent.

Precautionary/preparedness actions...
Avoid tossing burning cigarettes on the ground, parking hot vehicles
on dry vegetation, and using equipment that can cause sparks. Follow
all fire restrictions. Find links to restrictions at
weather.gov/medford/wildfire. One less spark, one less wildfire.
Gather your fire evacuation kit now. Collect essentials you don`t
want to lose and prioritize your checklist. Visit ready.gov/kit for
more information.
Familiarize yourself with your evacuation plan. Where will you go?
How will you get there? Who will you call to let others know your
are safe? Visit ready.gov/wildfires for more information.
A Red Flag Warning does not mean there is a fire. It means that
critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now or will
shortly. These conditions promote rapid spread of fire which may
become life threatening. Evacuate if ordered to, or if a fire
threatens.
