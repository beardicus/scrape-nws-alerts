<description>...Periods of Critical Conditions Expected Across Portions of
Southern Oregon and Northern California...
.The next couple of days will see periods of critical conditions
consisting of strong gusty wind and low RH today for portions of
Siskiyou County as well as thunderstorms capable of producing
frequent lightning in scattered showers along and east of the
Cascades. While the thunderstorms will likely become isolated
overnight tonight, they are expected to pick up in activity once
again on Tuesday. Additional periods of gusty winds and low
humidities will also be possible on Tuesday for portions of
Siskiyou and Jackson Counties.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO
9 PM PDT TUESDAY FOR STRONG ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR
FIRE WEATHER ZONES 285 AND 625...
* Impacts: Lightning and very dry vegetation will likely result in
new fire starts. Gusty thunderstorm winds could contribute to
fire spread. Despite rainfall, initial attack resources could be
overwhelmed and holdover fires are possible.
* Affected area:
In Northern CA Fire Zone 285: The warning has expanded to cover
most of the zone except for the southwest corner.
In South Central OR Fire Zone 625: All of zone 625
* Wind: South 10 to 20 mph with gusts up to 30 mph. Near
thunderstorms, quickly shifting winds to 50 mph are possible.
* Thunderstorms: Thunderstorm activity will likely begin by mid-
afternoon Monday with the most active period likely in the late
afternoon and evening. Activity could linger at night and into
Tuesday, shifting east and north with time. Storms will also
become wetter by Tuesday.

Precautionary Preparedness Actions...
Avoid tossing burning cigarettes on the ground, parking hot
vehicles on dry vegetation, and using equipment that can cause
sparks. Follow all fire restrictions. Find links to restrictions
at weather.gov/medford/wildfire. One less spark, one less
wildfire.
Gather your fire evacuation kit now. Collect essentials you don`t
want to lose and prioritize your checklist. Visit ready.gov/kit
for more information.
Familiarize yourself with your evacuation plan. Where will you go?
How will you get there? Who will you call to let others know your
are safe? Visit ready.gov/wildfires for more information.
A Red Flag Warning does not mean there is a fire. It means that
critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now or will
shortly. These conditions promote rapid spread of fire which may
become life threatening. Evacuate if ordered to, or if a fire
threatens.</description>
