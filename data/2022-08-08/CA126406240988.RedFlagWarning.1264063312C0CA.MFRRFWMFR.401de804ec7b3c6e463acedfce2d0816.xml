<headline>Red Flag Warning issued August 08 at 10:46PM PDT until August 09 at 9:00PM PDT by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM PDT TUESDAY FOR
ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONES 284 AND 285
IN CALIFORNIA AND 624 AND 625 IN OREGON...
* Impacts: Lightning and very dry vegetation will likely result in
new fire starts. Gusty thunderstorm winds could contribute to
fire spread. Despite rainfall, initial attack resources could be
overwhelmed and holdover fires are possible. In western portions
of zone 284, strong, gusty wind with low relative humidity and
critically dry vegetation could also greatly increase the spread
potential of any new and existing fires Tuesday afternoon and
evening.
* Affected area:
In Northern CA Fire Zones...284...285.
In South Central OR Fire Zones...624...625.
* Wind: South 10 to 20 mph with gusts up to 30 mph. Near
thunderstorms, quickly shifting winds to 50 mph are possible.
* Thunderstorms: Thunderstorms will increase through this evening.
Activity could linger tonight and into Tuesday, shifting east
and north with time. Storms will also become wetter by Tuesday.
* Humidity: as low as 10 percent in western parts of zone 284.
