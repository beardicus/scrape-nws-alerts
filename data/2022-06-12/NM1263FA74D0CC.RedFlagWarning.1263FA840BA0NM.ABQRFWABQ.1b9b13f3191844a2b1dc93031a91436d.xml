...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
TUESDAY EVENING FOR NORTHEAST AND EAST CENTRAL NEW MEXICO DUE TO
STRONG WINDS, LOW HUMIDITY AND AN UNSTABLE AIRMASS...
.An upper level trough will approach from the west today,
allowing southwest winds to increase across parts of northern New
Mexico. The combination of strong winds with very low humidity,
near record heat, and an unstable airmass will generate critical
fire weather conditions. Winds will continue to strengthen across
the area Monday, and with very low humidity and well above normal
temperatures, critical fire weather conditions will become more
widespread across northern and eastern New Mexico. The upper
trough passes to our north Tuesday with the strongest winds and
continued dry conditions over much of eastern New Mexico.
