...WIND ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM TO 9 PM MDT MONDAY...

Wind Advisory, southwest winds 20 to 30 mph with gusts up to
55 mph expected.
* WHERE...San Rafael Swell, Capitol Reef National Park and

Area/Lake Powell.
* WHEN...For the Heat Advisory, until 9 PM MDT this evening. For
the Wind Advisory, from 11 AM to 9 PM MDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Gusty winds could blow around unsecured objects. A few
power outages are possible. Patchy blowing dust is possible,
which may cause reduced visibility as well as rapid fluctuations
in visibility. Winds will cause difficult travel conditions for
high profile vehicles and vehicles with trailers, especially
along east to west oriented routes. Gusty winds will cause rough
conditions on area waterways, including Lake Powell. Hot
temperatures may cause heat illnesses to occur.</description>
<instruction>Use extra caution when driving, especially if operating a high
profile vehicle. Secure outdoor objects.
Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
