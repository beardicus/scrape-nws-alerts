MONDAY...
.An approaching upper level system will give the Gila breezy to
windy afternoon conditions on Monday. These stronger winds will
combine with low min RH`s of 10 to 15% and very dry fuel moisture
because of the on going drought to give us elevated to critical
fire weather conditions for Monday afternoon. The gusty winds will
slow by late in the evening, but overnight RH recoveries will
only be modest.

VERY DRY AIR AND BREEZY CONDITIONS...
