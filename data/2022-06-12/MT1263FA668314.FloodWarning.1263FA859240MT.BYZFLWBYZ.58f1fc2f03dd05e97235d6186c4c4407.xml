Warning for the following rivers in Montana...
Yellowstone River near Livingston affecting Park and Sweet Grass
Counties.
Clarks Fork Of The Yellowstone at Edgar affecting Carbon County.

these rivers. In addition to the snowmelt, heavy rainfall may
further increase water levels over the next few days. At this time
expect rivers to rise above flood stage Monday. Colder temperatures
in the high country will slow snowmelt by Tuesday allowing river
levels to recede into the middle of the week. In addition to minor
flooding of low lying areas along the rivers, significant erosion is
likely.

forecast.

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles. Do not drive on or attempt to cross
flooded roads, find an alternate route. Roads and driveways may be
damaged or washed out in places.
Caution is urged when walking near riverbanks. Undercut banks can
collapse and you will find yourself in a deadly situation in fast
moving cold water. Stay away from river banks until the river
recedes to normal summer flows, especially children.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency officials and
request they pass the information to the National Weather Service in
Billings.
Safety message...A river Flood Warning means river flooding is
expected to impact people and property in the warned area. Prepare
for flooding impacts associated with the forecast river levels in
your location.
The latest stages and forecasts for rivers and streams can be found
at our web page: water.weather.gov.
The next statement will be issued by Monday morning at 715 AM MDT.</instruction>
