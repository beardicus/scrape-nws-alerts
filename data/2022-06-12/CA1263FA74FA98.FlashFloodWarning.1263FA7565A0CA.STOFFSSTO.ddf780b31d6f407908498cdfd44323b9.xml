<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued June 12 at 8:26PM PDT until June 12 at 11:00PM PDT by NWS Sacramento</headline>
<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM PDT THIS
EVENING FOR SOUTHWESTERN LASSEN AND NORTHWESTERN PLUMAS COUNTIES...
At 826 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated that the thunderstorms that
produced heavy rain over the Dixie Fire West Burn Scar have moved
away from the area. Between 1 and 3 inches of rain fell from 12 pm
to 6 pm over portions of Plumas county. Water will continue draining
down creeks and canyons, which could cause debris flows.
Excessive rainfall over the warning area has caused mud and rock
slides along highway 70 through the feather river canyon. This has
caused several road closures. The mud slide can consist of rock,
mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Flash flooding in and
around the Dixie Burn Scar.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Life threatening flash flooding of areas in and around
the Dixie Burn Scar.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...

Country Club, Canyondam, East Shore, Caribou, Seneca, Belden,
Twain, Paxton, Indian Falls, Bald Eagle Mountain, Tobin, Crescent
Mills, Storrie, Keddie and Greenville.
