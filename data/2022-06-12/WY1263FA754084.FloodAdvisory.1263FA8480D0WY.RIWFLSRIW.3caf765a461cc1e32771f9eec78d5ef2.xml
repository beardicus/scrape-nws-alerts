<headline>Flood Advisory issued June 12 at 11:05PM MDT  by NWS Riverton</headline>
<description>.Warm temperatures Sunday caused more high elevation
snowmelt, and this water will make its way through area streams and
rivers overnight and into the day Monday. Steady light to moderate
rain is also causing streams and rivers to run high and fast. This
will likely continue over the next 48 hours.
...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM MDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of northwest Wyoming, including the following
county, Park.
* WHEN...Until 1000 PM MDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
River or stream flows are elevated and are likely to overflow
banks causing flooding in some areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1055 PM MDT, radar rainfall estimates suggest flooding may
be occurring in the advisory area, as flood guidance has been
surpassed over the past six hours. Additionally, high
elevation snowmelt could be accelerated by rain falling.
There are no river gauges in the Advisory area.</description>
<instruction>Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.
Campers and hikers should avoid setting up camp near streams or
creeks.</instruction>
