<description>...Gusty winds and potential for blowing dust in northwest Nye
County...
A weather disturbance and frontal boundary will move through
central Nevada Wednesday bringing a mix of light rain and snow
showers to northwestern Nye county. However, the more impactful
weather element will be the gusty northwest winds that develop
during and after the frontal passage beginning late morning into
the afternoon hours. Northwest winds of 15-25 mph with gusts to
40 mph will be common with wind prone areas experiencing wind
gusts around 45 mph. This has the potential to generate blowing
dust in the area as precipitation is expected to be light. Use
caution while driving particularly on exposed summits and passes.
Improving conditions including diminishing showers and decreasing
winds are expected Wednesday night into Thursday.
