<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued May 10 at 2:34PM EDT until May 12 at 6:00AM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM EDT
THURSDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, 1 to 3 feet of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways. For the Beach Hazards
Statement, dangerous rip currents and large breaking waves
expected.
* WHERE...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, areas along the
southern Pamlico Sound, lower Neuse River, and adjacent tidal
creeks. For the Beach Hazards Statement, oceanside Ocracoke
Island and Core Banks north of Cape Lookout.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 6 AM EDT
Thursday. For the Beach Hazards Statement, through this
evening.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Rip currents can sweep even
the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Dangerous
shore break can throw a swimmer or surfer head first into the
bottom causing neck and back injuries.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
