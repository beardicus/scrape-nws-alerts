<description>...ELEVATED RISK OF WILDFIRE SPREAD INTO THIS EVENING ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN POCONOS...
Relative humidity levels will drop to between 15 to 25 percent
through this afternoon along with northeast winds gusting to
around 25 mph at times. These very dry and breezy conditions will
pose an elevated risk for wildfire spread through this afternoon
in the southern Poconos where the green up has just started. Be
sure to heed any local and state burning regulations.
Residents are urged to exercise caution handling any potential
ignition source, including machinery, cigarettes, and matches. Be
sure to properly discard all smoking materials. Any dry grasses
and tree litter that ignite will have the potential to spread fire
quickly.
This statement has been issued in coordination with the
Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and National Resources. For
more information about wildfire danger, burn restrictions, and
wildfire prevention and education, please visit their website.</description>
