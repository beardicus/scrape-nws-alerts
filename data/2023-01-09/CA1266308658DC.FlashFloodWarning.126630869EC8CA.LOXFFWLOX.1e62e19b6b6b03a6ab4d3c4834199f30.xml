<instruction>A Flash Flood Warning for a recent burn area means that flooding and
debris flows are imminent or occurring. Residents living in or
immediately downstream should take immediate precautions to protect
life and property. Quickly move away from the burn area only if it
is safe to do so, otherwise shelter in place and move to a second
story or the highest location in your home to stay out of the path
of fast-moving water and debris flows.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.</instruction>
