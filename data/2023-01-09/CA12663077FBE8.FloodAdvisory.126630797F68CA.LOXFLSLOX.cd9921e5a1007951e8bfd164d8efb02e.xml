<headline>Flood Advisory issued January 09 at 5:38AM PST until further notice by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of southwest California, including the following
county, Santa Barbara.
* WHEN...Until 1000 AM PST.
* IMPACTS...Heavy rainfall will result in widespread ponding of
water on area roadways with flooding of low lying areas and
intersections.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 524 AM PST, Doppler radar indicated widespread moderate to
heavy rain across southern and western portions of Santa
Barbara County. The rain will spread across the remainder of
the county by 7 AM PST. Automated rain gauges indicated
rainfall rates of 0.20 and 0.40 inches per hour across much
of southern and western Santa Barbara County, with local
rates up to one half inch per hour. A few locations in the
foothills have received more than 1 inch of rain in the past
three hours. Flooding of roadways is imminent and will likely
continue through at least mid morning. There is a chance that
rainfall rates will increase, and if that occurs, the rain
could trigger shallow debris flows in and near recent burn
scars.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Santa Maria, Santa Barbara, Lompoc, Santa Ynez, Montecito,
Carpinteria, Solvang, Vandenberg Air Force Base, Los Alamos,
Highway 101 through Gaviota State Park, Isla Vista, Orcutt,
Cuyama, Summerland, Rincon Point, Goleta and Guadalupe.
