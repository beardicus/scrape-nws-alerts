<headline>High Surf Advisory issued January 09 at 5:47PM ChST until January 10 at 6:00AM ChST by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM TUESDAY...
...HIGH RISK OF RIP CURRENTS REMAINS THROUGH UNTIL 6 AM TUESDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM EARLY THURSDAY MORNING TO SUNDAY
AFTERNOON...
...HIGH RISK OF RIP CURRENTS FROM EARLY THURSDAY MORNING TO SUNDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...For the first High Surf Advisory and High Rip Current Risk,
hazardous surf of 7 to 9 feet in the surf zone and dangerous rip
currents expected. For the second High Surf Advisory and High Rip
Current Risk, large breaking waves of 10 to 14 feet in the surf zone
and dangerous rip currents expected.
* WHERE...North facing reefs of the Marianas.
* WHEN...For the first High Surf Advisory and High Rip Current Risk,
until 6 AM Tuesday. For the second High Surf Advisory and High Rip
Current Risk, from early Thursday morning to Sunday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized
beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The re-descent of a newly-energized shearline
induced by a strong high moving in from the Yellow Sea across the
northern Pacific will bring an exceptional north swell, introducing
hazardous surf to north facing reefs of the Marianas. Surf may
occasionally reach dangerous levels by Saturday, and as such, a
High Surf Warning may be considered if conditions warrant.</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to dangerous
surf conditions.
If caught in a rip current, relax and float. Don`t swim against the
current. If able, swim in a direction following the shoreline. If
unable to escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
