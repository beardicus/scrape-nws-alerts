inches below 5000 feet, with 2 to 5 inches above 5000 feet.
* WHERE...Northern Washoe County and Surprise Valley California.
* WHEN...From 2 AM to 4 PM PST Tuesday.

Highway 299 between Cedarville and Cedar Pass. The hazardous

is expected between 6 AM and 12 noon Tuesday.</description>
<instruction>Even light snowfall causes major travel delays, especially during
periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to
reach your destination. Leave extra space between vehicles since
it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
