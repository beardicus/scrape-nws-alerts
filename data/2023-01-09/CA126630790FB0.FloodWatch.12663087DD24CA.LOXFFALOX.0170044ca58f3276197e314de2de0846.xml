<headline>Flood Watch issued January 09 at 12:44PM PST  by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM PST THIS EVENING THROUGH
TUESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible within
the entire Watch area. Areas of most concern include the recent
burn areas like the Fish and Lake burns, urban roads and freeways,
and in creeks and streams.
* WHERE...A portion of southwest California, including the following
areas, Antelope Valley, Los Angeles County Beaches, Los Angeles
County Inland Coast including Downtown Los Angeles, Los Angeles
County Mountains, Los Angeles County San Fernando Valley, Los
Angeles County San Gabriel Valley, Malibu Coast, Santa Clarita
Valley and Santa Monica Mountains.
* WHEN...From 7 PM PST this evening through Tuesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in extensive street flooding
and flooding of creeks, streams, and other low-lying areas. Rock
slides and mud slides may become a significant problem. While
there is a chance of main stem river flooding, water flowing
through normally dry rivers and washes will threaten homeless
encampments, including on the Los Angeles River.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A strong Pacific storm system will bring periods of
widespread heavy rainfall with rates between one half and one
inch per hour, possibly higher near thunderstorms and favored
foothill areas. Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches are expected
in coastal and valley areas, with 4 to 8 inches expected in
the foothills and mountains. Local rainfall totals of 10
inches are possible.

to take action should flooding develop or if evacuations are ordered.</instruction>
