<headline>High Surf Advisory issued December 24 at 4:06PM ChST until December 27 at 6:00AM ChST by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM SUNDAY TO 6 AM CHST
TUESDAY...
...HIGH RISK OF RIP CURRENTS FROM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH LATE
MONDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 7
to 10 feet expected in the surf zone. For the High Rip Current
Risk, dangerous rip currents expected.
* WHERE...North facing reefs of the Marianas.
* WHEN...From 6 AM Sunday to 6 AM ChST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...An approaching northwest swell is expected to
bring hazardous surf and a high rip current risk to north facing
reefs of the Marianas. Surf is expected to remain just below
hazardous levels for west facing, though this could change if the
swell turns more northwest or is a bit higher than expected.</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
