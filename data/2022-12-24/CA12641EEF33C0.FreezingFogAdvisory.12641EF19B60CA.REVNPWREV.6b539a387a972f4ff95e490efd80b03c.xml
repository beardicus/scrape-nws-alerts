<instruction>Be extra cautious if driving through the dense fog areas of
northeast California tonight and Sunday morning. Use low beam
headlights and fog lamps, slow down and avoid braking and making
sudden turns as a thin ice layer may form on roads. This fog could
also produce icy patches on sidewalks, so be aware if walking
outside to reduce the risk of slipping and falling.
Now is the time to secure loose outdoor items such as patio
furniture, holiday decorations, and trash cans before winds
increase which could blow these items away. The best thing to do
is prepare ahead of time by making sure you have extra food and
water on hand, flashlights with spare batteries and/or candles in
the event of a power outage.</instruction>
