<description>...HEAVY SNOW CONTINUING IN THE LAKE SUPERIOR SNOWBELT, WITH BLOWING
AND DRIFTING SNOW CONTINUING TO PRODUCE HAZARDOUS TRAVEL ELSEWHERE...
.Intense low pressure over western Quebec will continue to generate
strong northwest winds across the area today into tonight. The winds
will continue to generate blowing and drifting snow and hazardous
travel conditions in open areas. Cold air flowing across Lake
Superior will result in heavy lake-effect snow showers in the Lake
Superior snowbelt.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM CST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Heavy snow and blowing and drifting snow.  Additional snow
accumulations from 4 to 8 inches in the snowbelt, to 1 to 4 inches
elsewhere. Winds gusting to 35 mph will produce widespread blowing
and drifting snow.
* WHERE...Vilas County.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM CST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Difficult travel conditions, especially in open areas
where significantly reduced visibility will occur at times.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The combination of cold and wind will result
in wind chills of 10 below to 20 below zero. This could result in
exposed skin suffering frostbite in as little as 30 minutes. The
snow showers will continue tonight, but should diminish by that
time.</description>
<instruction>If possible, consider postponing travel until conditions improve. If
you must travel, drive with extreme caution. Consider taking a
winter storm kit along with you, including such items as tire
chains, booster cables, flashlight, shovel, blankets and extra
clothing. Also take water, a first aid kit, and anything else that
would help you survive in case you become stranded. Be sure your
vehicle has sufficient fuel before crossing open areas.</instruction>
