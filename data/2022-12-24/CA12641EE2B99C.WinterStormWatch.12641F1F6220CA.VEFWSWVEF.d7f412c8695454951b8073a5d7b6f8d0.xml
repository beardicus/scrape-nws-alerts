<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued December 24 at 12:47PM PST until December 28 at 10:00AM PST by NWS LasVegas</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY EVENING THROUGH
WEDNESDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Periods of high wind and blowing snow possible. Total
snow accumulations of 5 to 8 inches possible below 9000 feet
with 1 to 2 feet possible above 9000ft. Winds could gust as high
as 60 mph in the slopes and above 70 mph at ridgetops.
* WHERE...Eastern Sierra Slopes.
* WHEN...From Monday evening through Wednesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Plan on periods of blowing snow resulting in slippery
road conditions and very low visibility. Very strong gusty winds
could bring down trees, their branches, and any suspended power
lines.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow levels above 9000 feet initially will
lead to periods of moderate to heavy rain in higher elevations
in which snow pack is prevalent. This will likely result in
accelerated melting and result in creeks and streams overcoming
banks and other runoff impacts.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Watch means there is potential for significant
snow accumulations that may impact travel. Continue to monitor
the latest forecasts.</instruction>
