<description>...THREAT OF URBAN AND RIVER RIVER FLOODING THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK
ACROSS WESTERN WASHINGTON...
A series of storm systems will bring moderate to heavy precipitation
and a rapid warm-up through the weekend into next week. The first
round of moderate to heavy rainfall will occur today with snow
levels rising to 6000 to 7000 feet. Additional enhancement of runoff
and impacts may result from rain falling on existing snow -
including urban flooding concerns as drainage systems may not be
able to keep up with the increased runoff from the rain and the
melting snow. Rises are expected on all area rivers. However
widespread flooding is not expected through Sunday night at this
time.
Additional moderate to heavy rainfall early next week is expected as
a series of atmospheric rivers may take aim at the Pacific
Northwest. Each of these potentially wet systems are lined up to
impact the region every 24 hours or so. This could lead to
additional river flooding, especially with snow levels likely
remaining elevated with these warm and moist weather systems.  This
will lead to progressively higher flows through at least the first
part of next week. Confidence remains somewhat low in pinpointing any
particular basins for early next week due to the complex evolution
of the pattern and the uncertainty of the impact of snowmelt,
combined with heavy rain and warming.
The next update will be provided by 10:00 AM Sunday, December 25.
Please monitor the latest river forecasts from the National Weather
Service for additional information.</description>
