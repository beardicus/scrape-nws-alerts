<description>...WIND CHILL ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON EST SUNDAY...
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM EST
SUNDAY...
* WHAT...For the Wind Chill Advisory, very cold wind chills
occurring. Wind chills as low as 20 below zero. For the Winter
Weather Advisory, lake effect snow expected. Additional snow
accumulations of 3 to 6 inches possible near and north of I-90,
with 2 to 4 inches possible south. Winds gusting as high as 45
mph, causing blowing and drifting snow.
* WHERE...Northern Erie and Southern Erie counties.
* WHEN...For the Wind Chill Advisory, until noon EST Sunday. For
the Winter Weather Advisory, until 4 PM EST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. Gusty winds could
bring down tree branches. The cold wind chills could cause
frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The highest wind gusts are expected near
the lakeshore. Lake effect snow will sink southward toward the
lakeshore of Erie County this evening into Sunday morning, which
may result in accumulation on roadways and reduced visibilities.
If the lake effect snow moves into the area sooner than
expected, the advisory may need to be expanded and/or upgraded
to a Lake Effect Snow Warning.</description>
