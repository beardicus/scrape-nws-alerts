<description>...SNOWFALL DIMINISHING FOR MANY AREAS FOR CHRISTMAS EVE...
Snow totals across the panhandle have ranged from as low as 2
inches to up to 13 inches, but most have been in the 4 to 8 inch
range. The first band of precipitation has moved out of the area
to the north and the second is now forecast to stall and weaken
over the central inner channels this evening. Several winter storm
warnings have been cancelled as a result.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM AKST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Heavy snow and blowing snow expected. Total snow
accumulations of 10 to 15 inches.
* WHERE...Petersburg, Kake, Port Alexander, and surrounding
areas.
* WHEN...Until 9 PM AKST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility near downtown
Juneau.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow rates are starting to increase again
as the next snow band starts to move in. Around 7 inches of snow
has already falling in the area. Expect another 2 to 5 inches
of snow through the afternoon and evening hours with low
visibility at times.</description>

your vehicle in case of an emergency.</instruction>
