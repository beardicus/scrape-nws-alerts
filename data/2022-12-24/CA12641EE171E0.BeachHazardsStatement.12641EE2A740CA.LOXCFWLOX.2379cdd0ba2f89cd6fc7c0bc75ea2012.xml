<description>...HIGHEST TIDES OF THE YEAR...OR KING TIDES...WILL CAUSE PERIODS
OF MINOR TIDAL OVERFLOWS AND INCREASED RIP CURRENT ACTIVITY
THROUGH MIDDAY SATURDAY...
.The highest astronomical tides of the year, or King Tides, will
affect areas beaches and coastlines through this morning, when
high tide is forecast to occur. King tides have historically
resulted in the minor flooding of beach walkways and normal dry
beach areas and increased rip current activity.
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON PST
TODAY...
* WHAT...Dangerous rip currents and breaking waves due to
elevated surf of 3 to 6 feet expected. Abnormally high tides
around 7 feet are expected this morning. Minor tidal overflow
is possible around the time of morning high tide.
* WHERE...Greatest impacts are expected on the west facing
beaches of Catalina and Santa Barbara Islands, Malibu Coast
and Los Angeles County Beaches.
* WHEN...Until noon PST today.
* IMPACTS...Pooling of sea water is possible around high tide at
beach and harbor areas that is uncommon with normal tidal
ranges. Enhanced beach erosion is also possible. No significant
damage is expected. There is an increased risk of ocean drowning
due to increased rip current activity. Rip currents can pull
swimmers and surfers out to sea. Waves can wash people off
beaches and rocks, and capsize small small boats nearshore.</description>
<instruction>Remain out of the water due to hazardous swimming conditions, or
stay near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly
in such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
