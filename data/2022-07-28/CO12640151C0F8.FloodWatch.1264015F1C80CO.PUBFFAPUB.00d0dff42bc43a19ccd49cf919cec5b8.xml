- The coverage and intensity of showers and thunderstorms are
forecast to increase through the day on Thursday, with
scattered to numerous activity affecting the Watch area
Thursday afternoon and evening. Very heavy rainfall may
accompany this activity, which will have the potential to
result in localized flash flooding. While showers and
thunderstorms will lessen in coverage Thursday night, heavy
rainfall could continue into the overnight hours in some
locations, prolonging the flooding potential. More rounds of
heavy showers and thunderstorms may extend the risk for flash
flooding into Friday.
