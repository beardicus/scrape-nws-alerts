<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued July 28 at 7:48PM MDT until July 28 at 10:45PM MDT by NWS Cheyenne</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Cheyenne has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
Southeastern Carbon County in south central Wyoming...
Southwestern Albany County in southeastern Wyoming...
* Until 1045 PM MDT.
* At 748 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing
heavy rain across the warned area. The expected rainfall rate is
0.5 to 1 inch in 1 hour. Additional rainfall amounts of 0.5 to 1
inch are possible in the warned area. Flash flooding is ongoing or
expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar may result in debris flow
moving through the Middle Douglas Creek, Fox Creek, South Fork of
the Little Laramie River, Pelton Creek. Water could move into the
lower Douglas Creek watershed. The debris flow can consist of rock,
mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding caused by
thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Life threatening flash flooding of creeks and streams,
urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Albany, Miller Lake Campground, Evans Creek Campground, Bobbie
Thompson Campground, Illinois Creek Campground, Lake Owen, Lake
Owen Campground, Woods Landing-Jelm and Woods Landing.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE
EXPECTED RAINFALL RATE...0.5-1 INCH IN 1 HOUR</description>
<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.</instruction>
