<headline>High Surf Advisory issued February 11 at 1:49AM PST until February 12 at 3:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM THIS MORNING TO
3 PM PST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Large breaking waves of 6 to 10 feet with dangerous rip
currents.
* WHERE...Ventura County Beaches.
* WHEN...From 9 AM this morning to 3 PM PST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...There is an increased risk of drowning. Rip currents
can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Large breaking waves
can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and
capsize small boats near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Surf will peak this afternoon through early
Sunday, then will slowly subside. Surf will be highest on
northwest facing beaches. Another round of high surf, possibly
even larger, is expected early next week.</description>
<instruction>Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Stay off rock jetties, since they
can be deadly locations in such conditions.</instruction>
