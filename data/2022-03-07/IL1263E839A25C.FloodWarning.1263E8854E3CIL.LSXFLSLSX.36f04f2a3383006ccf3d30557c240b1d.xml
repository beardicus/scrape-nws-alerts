<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Rainfall heavier than forecast could cause river levels to rise even
higher than predicted. The NationalWeather Service will monitor this
developing situation and issue follow up statements as conditions
change.
