<headline>Flood Watch issued March 07 at 4:57AM EST  by NWS Paducah</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM CST THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of southwest Indiana and western Kentucky,
including the following areas, in southwest Indiana, Spencer. In
western Kentucky, Daviess.
* WHEN...Until 9 AM CST this morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water
crossings may be flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rainfall rates in and near thunderstorms may exceed the
ability for the ground to absorb the torrential rainfall and
the creeks and streams to handle the runoff. With most of
this rainfall occurring at nighttime, dangers of flooding
will only increase for drivers and residents across the
region.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
