<instruction>Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. Most flood related deaths
occur in automobiles. Do not attempt to cross water covered bridges,

even a small one, on foot. To escape rising water find another route
over higher ground.
