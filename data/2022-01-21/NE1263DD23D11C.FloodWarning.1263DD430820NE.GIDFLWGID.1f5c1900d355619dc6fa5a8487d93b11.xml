<headline>Flood Warning issued January 21 at 11:43AM CST  by NWS Hastings</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING FOR AN ICE JAM NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM CST
SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Minor flooding caused by an ice jam continues.
* WHERE...Along the Middle Loup River in parts of Sherman County,
particularly in the Loup City and Rockville areas.
* WHEN...Until 400 PM CST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding of low-lying pasture land immediately
adjacent to the river is expected to continue. Also expect areas
of slow moving or standing water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1126 AM CST, Friday, an automated gauge near Rockville
indicated a persistent ice jam in the area, with the river
level fluctuating around the minor flood stage of 8.5 feet.
Minor flooding along the river in the Rockville area was also
confirmed by local emergency management.
- Because the short-term behavior of ice jams can be difficult
to predict, those with interests along the Middle Loup River
should closely monitor water levels, as continued
fluctuations are likely. The validity of this Warning will be
assessed on a day-to-day basis based on gauge readings and
ground-truth reports, and an extension-in-time of this
Warning is possible in later updates.
- Some locations that could experience flooding include...
locations immediately along the Middle Loup River in parts of
Sherman County.

enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
