<headline>High Surf Warning issued January 21 at 8:38PM HST until January 23 at 6:00AM HST by NWS Honolulu</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF WARNING FOR NORTH AND WEST FACING SHORES OF NIIHAU
KAUAI OAHU AND MOLOKAI...NORTH FACING SHORES OF MAUI...AND WEST
FACING SHORES OF THE BIG ISLAND...
.Evening observations at the offshore buoys to the northwest have
surged well above predicted levels this evening, which supports
larger surf and an increasing likelihood for coastal impacts late
tonight into Saturday. Surf at this level coinciding with the
early morning high tide cycle just before daybreak Saturday will
translate to erosion issues with water sweeping across portions of
the coast that typically remain dry, with an increasing
likelihood of some periodic overwash onto the typical vulnerable
coastal roads when the larger, more infrequent, sets roll through.
With the more westerly direction in the swell, the largest surf
is expected on exposed shores of Kauai through this peak.
...HIGH SURF WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM HST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Surf building to 10 to 15 feet late Saturday.
* WHERE...West facing shores of Big Island.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM HST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Very High...Expect ocean water surging and sweeping
across beaches, coastal benches, and lava flows creating the
potential for impacts to coastal properties and infrastructure,
including roadways. Powerful longshore and rip currents will be
present at most beaches. Large breaking waves and strong
currents may impact harbor entrances and channels causing
challenging boat handling.</description>
<instruction>Large, breaking surf, significant shorebreak, and dangerous
currents make entering the water very hazardous.
Anyone entering the water could face significant injury or death.</instruction>
