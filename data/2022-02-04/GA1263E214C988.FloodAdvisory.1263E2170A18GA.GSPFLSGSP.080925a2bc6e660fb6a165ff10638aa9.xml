<headline>Flood Advisory issued February 04 at 2:54AM EST until further notice by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM EST THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Nuisance to Minor flooding caused by excessive rainfall
continues.
* WHERE...Habersham and Rabun counties in Georgia.
* WHEN...Until 100 PM EST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance to Minor flooding of common, flood-prone areas
is ongoing.  Expect impacts to low-water crossings, boat-access
areas, low-elevation roadways adjacent to streams, poorly draining
urban areas and intersections, campgrounds, greenways, and parks.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 253 AM EST, Over the past 36 hours, Rabun and Habersham
counties received widespread rainfall accumulations of 2 to 5
inches with isolated amounts nearing six inches in central
Rabun County.  This has caused significant rises on area
creeks and streams, with several streams exceeding bankfull
conditions, resulting in nuisance to Minor flooding of
adjacent flood-prone areas.
Light rain will persist across the area into early Friday
morning before tapering off between 8 and 10am.
Nevertheless, additional amounts of rain will remain light,
generally between 0.50 and 1 inch.  This may prolong the
cresting of area streams, but will not exacerbate ongoing
high flows.
- The Tallulah River above Lake Burton has exceed bankfull,
causing nuisance flooding of adjacent low-lying areas
including around Fred Thompson Road.  The river crested at
5.8 feet between midnight and 1am and is slowly receding.
Expect the Tallulah River to fall below the Action/Advisory
Stage of 5.0 feet late Friday morning.
The Soque River near Clarkesville has exceeded the Minor
Flood Stage of 13.0 feet and continues to rise slowly.  The
river will continue to rise to between 14 and 15 feet before
cresting early Friday morning. Expect the Soque River to fall
below Minor Flood Stage by early Friday afternoon and below
Action/Advisory Stage Friday evening. Between 11.0 and 15.0
feet, the Soque River is flooding adjacent low-lying areas,
including farmland and woodland several miles up- and
downstream of Clarkesville, as well as around Pitts Park and
Beaver Dam Rd in Clarkesville.
Tiger Creek at W Wolf Creek Rd in Lakemont crested at 3.6
feet around midnight and is slowly receding.  Expect Tiger
Creek to fall below 2 feet later Friday morning.
Additional rises are possible so please stay away from all
streams and stay weather-aware.
- Some locations that will experience nuisance to Minor
flooding include...
Toccoa, Clayton, Clarkesville, Cornelia, Baldwin, Demorest,
Mount Airy, Alto, Mountain City, Tiger, Dillard, Sky Valley,
Tallulah Falls, Lake Rabun, Lakemont, Lake Burton, Raoul, and
Seed Lake.</description>
<instruction>Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
