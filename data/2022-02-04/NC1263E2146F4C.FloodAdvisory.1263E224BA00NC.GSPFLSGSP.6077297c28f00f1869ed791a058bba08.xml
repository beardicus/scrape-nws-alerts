<headline>Flood Advisory issued February 04 at 12:23AM EST until February 05 at 7:00AM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has issued
a Flood Advisory for the following rivers in North Carolina...
French Broad River Near Fletcher affecting Buncombe and Henderson
Counties.
.Approximately 3-5 inches of rain have fallen across the upper
French Broad watershed over the past 24 hours, causing significant
rises along the French Broad River and associated tributaries.  The
heaviest rainfall has departed the area but additional rounds of
light to moderate rainfall are expected through Friday morning.
Therefore, it will take many hours for excessive runoff to subside
and for tributaries to crest and begin their recession.  These high
flows are causing the upper French Broad River to exceed bankfull,
resulting in isolated nuisance flooding from Horse Shoe to Mills
River to Avery Creek.  This flooding will primarily impact farmland
and boat-access areas.  Please stay weather aware tonight and
monitor the latest forecasts and stream levels for up-to-date
information.
...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM EARLY THIS MORNING TO TOMORROW
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...French Broad River Near Fletcher.
* WHEN...From early this morning to tomorrow morning.
* IMPACTS...At 10.0 feet, Action/Advisory Stage.  The French Broad
River has exceeded bankfull at the gauge site.  Isolated farmland
flooding is beginning across the French Broad River Valley from
Etowah downstream to Avery Creek upstream of the gauge site.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 11:46 PM EST Thursday the stage was 9.2 feet and rising
rapidly.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise to a crest between
10.5 and 11.0 feet this afternoon.
