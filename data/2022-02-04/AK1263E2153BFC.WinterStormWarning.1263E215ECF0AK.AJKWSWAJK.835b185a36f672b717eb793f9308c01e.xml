<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued February 04 at 1:47AM AKST until February 04 at 6:00AM AKST by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM AKST EARLY
THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Heavy snow and periods of light freezing rain expected.
Additional snow accumulations of 6 to 12 inches. Ice
accumulations less than one tenth of an inch.
* WHERE...Juneau.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM AKST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Wet snow may be
difficult to manage. Light freezing rain will cover exposed
surfaces with a coating of ice.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow and freezing rain are expected to
continue through Friday morning mainly North of Lemon Creek.
Downtown and Douglas have warmed above freezing and are likely
seeing a mix of rain and snow. The airport will likely
transition to rain before Mendenhall Valley and further out the
road. Confidence is low regarding the exact timing of the
transition to rain and the freezing rain potential, which could
greatly affect total snowfall amounts. Areas that receive more
mixed precipitation and change to rain sooner will likely have
lower snowfall amounts.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.</instruction>
