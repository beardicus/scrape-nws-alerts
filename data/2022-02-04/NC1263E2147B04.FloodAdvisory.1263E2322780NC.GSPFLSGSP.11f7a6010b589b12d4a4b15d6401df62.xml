<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 1230 PM EST THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Transylvania County in North Carolina.
* WHEN...Until 1230 PM EST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance to Minor flooding of common, flood-prone areas
is likely.  Expect impacts to low-water crossings, boat-access
areas, low-elevation roadways adjacent to streams, campgrounds,
greenways, and parks.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1231 AM EST, Over the past 36 hours, Transylvania County
has received 3-6 inches of rainfall due to persistent light
to moderate showers.  This has caused excessive runoff and
significant rises on areas streams.  Several streams have
exceeded bankfull and are causing scattered nuisance flooding
over adjacent low-lying areas.
The heaviest rainfall has ended across the region, but
another inch of rain is possible through Friday morning.
Therefore, it will take several hours for streams to crest
and begin their recession.  Reaches of the French Broad
River, Little River, and Davidson River will not fall back
below bankfull levels until later Friday.
- The French Broad River in Rosman has reached the
Action/Advisory Stage of 7.0 feet and is now exceeding its
banks in isolated locations.  The river is expected to
continue to rise over the next few hours and crest between
7.5 and 8.0 feet before receding into early Friday morning.
These elevated levels will cause nuisance flooding of
adjacent low-lying farmland from Rosman downstream to
Brevard.  Shallow flooding of Hannah Ford, Island Ford, and
Green roads is likely.
The Davidson River near Pisgah Forest is approaching the
Action/Advisory Stage of 5.0 feet and will likely exceed
bankfull over the next few hours.  Expect the Davidson River
to crest between 5.0 and 6.0 feet overnight tonight or early
Friday morning.  These levels will likely cause shallow
flooding of Davidson River Rd, Wilson Rd, and Deavor Rd.
The Little River near Penrose has exceeded the
Action/Advisory Stage of 7.5 feet and is expected to crest
around 10.0 feet early Friday morning.  At these levels,
inundation of 12-18&quot; is occurring in the farmlands adjacent
to Cascade Lake Rd and Merrill Ln, with inundation 6-12&quot; deep
along Cascade Lake Rd and Merrill Ln.
Additional rises are possible so please stay away from all
streams and stay weather-aware.
- Some locations that may experience nuisance flooding
include...
Brevard, Rosman, Looking Glass, Gorges State Park, Lake
Toxaway, Dupont State Forest, Connestee, Balsam Grove,
Penrose, Cedar Mountain, and Sapphire.</description>
<instruction>Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
