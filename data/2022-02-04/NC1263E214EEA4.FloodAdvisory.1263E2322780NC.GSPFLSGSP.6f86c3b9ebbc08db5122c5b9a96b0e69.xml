<headline>Flood Advisory issued February 04 at 3:49AM EST until February 05 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 330 PM EST THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Portions of Macon and Swain counties in North Carolina.
* WHEN...Until 330 PM EST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to the
Little Tennessee River and adjacent tributaries is ongoing.
Expect impacts to low-water crossings, boat-access areas,
low-elevation roadways adjacent to streams, campgrounds,
greenways, and parks.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 333 AM EST, Over the past 36 hours, the Little Tennessee
River watershed received widespread 2-4 inches of rainfall
due to persistent light to moderate showers.  This has caused
significant rises along the Little Tennessee River and its
tributaries with the Little Tennessee River beginning to
exceed bankfull or Action/Advisory Stage.  This will cause
nuisance flooding of adjacent low-lying areas through Friday
morning and perhaps into Friday afternoon.
Additional rainfall of 0.50 to one inch is expected through
mid-morning Friday before tapering off.  This will not
exacerbate ongoing high streamflows, but it may prolong
crests and slow recessions later this morning.
- The Little Tennessee River from Franklin to Cowee to Needmore
to Almond is exceeding Action/Advisory Stage and will
continue to slowly rise over the next few hours.  This will
cause nuisance flooding of adjacent low-lying areas,
including Needmore Rd.  The Little Tennessee River should
crest below 9.0 feet later Friday morning and gradually
recede through Friday afternoon.
- Some locations that may experience nuisance flooding
include...
Franklin, Burningtown, Cowee, Luada and Almond.</description>
<instruction>In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
