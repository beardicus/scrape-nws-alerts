<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued February 04 at 4:44AM AKST until February 04 at 12:00PM AKST by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON AKST TODAY...
* WHAT...Snow and periods of light freezing rain expected.
Additional snow accumulations of 1 to 4 inches. Ice
accumulations less than one tenth of an inch.
* WHERE...Juneau.
* WHEN...Until noon AKST today.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Wet snow may be
difficult to manage. Freezing rain will cover exposed surfaces
with a coating of ice.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow and freezing rain are expected to
continue through Friday morning north of Lemon Creek. Downtown
and Douglas have warmed above freezing and are seeing a mix of
rain and snow. The airport will likely transition to rain before
the Mendenhall Valley and further out the road. Confidence is
low regarding the exact timing of the transition to rain and the
freezing rain potential, which could greatly affect total
snowfall amounts. Areas that receive more mixed precipitation
and change to rain sooner will likely have lower snowfall
amounts.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.</instruction>
