<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT
THROUGH SUNDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Increased risk for dangerous rip currents and larger
breakers of 4 to 9 feet expected due to incoming southerly
swell.
* WHERE...Northern Monterey Bay and Southern Monterey Bay and
Big Sur Coast Counties.
* WHEN...From late tonight through Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...Possible dangers to inexperienced swimmers, surfers,
and anyone standing or walking in or close to the water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Larger southerly swell of 3 to 4 feet at 15
to 16 seconds will arrive Saturday morning. This swell
originated from Hurricane Jova and could bring an increased risk
of dangerous rip currents as well as elevated surf, particularly
for south facing beaches, including Santa Cruz.</description>
<instruction>Never turn your back to the ocean! Sneaker waves can occur at any
time without warning. It is safest to swim at a beach with
lifeguards. If you are caught in a rip current, don`t try to swim
against it. Instead, swim out of the current, parallel to the
shore, and then back to shore. If you can`t swim, float or tread
water, and yell or wave for help if you need assistance.</instruction>
