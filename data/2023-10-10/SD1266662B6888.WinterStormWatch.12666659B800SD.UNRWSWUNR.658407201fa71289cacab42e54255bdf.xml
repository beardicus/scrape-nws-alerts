<description>...STRONG FALL STORM MAY BRING HEAVY SNOWFALL TO PORTIONS OF THE
BLACK HILLS THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY...
.A strong fall storm will develop over the Plains late Wednesday
into Thursday, bringing heavy precipitation and strong winds to
our area through early Friday. Precipitation will begin as rain,
with some thunderstorms expected Wednesday into Wednesday night.
As colder air wraps into the system late Wednesday night into
Thursday morning, precipitation will change over to snow across
higher elevations of the Black Hills, where accumulating snow is
likely Thursday morning through Friday morning. Rain may mix with
or change over to snow across the foothills and portions of the
northeastern Wyoming and western South Dakota plains later
Thursday into Friday, but confidence in precipitation types is
relatively low outside of the Black Hills. Precipitation will
taper off from west to east on Friday.
...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY MORNING THROUGH
LATE THURSDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 7
inches or more possible. Winds could gust as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...In South Dakota, the Northern Black Hills and the
Central Black Hills. In Wyoming, the Wyoming Black Hills.
* WHEN...From Thursday morning through late Thursday night.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Watch means heavy snow, strong winds, freezing
precipitation, and cold temperatures are possible. Monitor NOAA
weather radio, local radio or television, or the Internet for
updates on this potentially dangerous storm. Take time to prepare
for severe winter conditions before the storm develops.</instruction>
