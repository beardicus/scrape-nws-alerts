<description>...HEAVY SNOWFALL POSSIBLE IN THE BLACK HILLS REGION THURSDAY
INTO FRIDAY...
.A strong fall storm will develop over the Plains late Wednesday
into Thursday, bringing heavy precipitation and strong winds to
our area through early Friday. Precipitation will begin as rain,

As colder air wraps into the system late Wednesday night into
Thursday morning, precipitation will change over to snow across
higher elevations of the Black Hills, where accumulating snow is
likely Thursday morning through Friday morning. Rain may mix with
or change over to snow across the foothills and portions of the
northeastern Wyoming and western South Dakota plains later
Thursday into Friday, but confidence in precipitation types is
remains low outside of the Black Hills. Precipitation will taper
off from west to east on Friday.

LATE THURSDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Heavy wet snow possible. Accumulations over 6 inches
will be possible, especially at elevations above 3500 feet.

Sturgis/Piedmont Foot Hills.
* WHEN...From Thursday afternoon through late Thursday night.
