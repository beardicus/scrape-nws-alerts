<description>...Widespread rainfall and localized flooding possible through the
weekend...
A strong storm system will move into the Midwest and Great Lakes
region late this week bringing the potential for multiple waves of
rainfall. Rainfall may be heavy enough to cause localized flooding
of urban areas, poor drainage areas, and streams. This flood
potential exists from late Wednesday through the weekend.
Soil moisture conditions across the area range from below average to
slightly above average. Many areas of northeast Illinois have
experienced below average precipitation during the last 1 to 2
weeks, leading to relatively dry soil moisture. The driest soil
moisture conditions exist in north central Illinois near Rockford,
where drought conditions continue. A few areas in Lee, Ogle, Grundy,
Kankakee, Lake, and Porter counties have experienced heavy rainfall
during that period, leading to slightly elevated soil moisture
conditions in isolated areas.
Confidence is not yet high on the exact locations that will
experience heavy rainfall, but it is probable that an east-west
corridor of heavy showers and thunderstorms will develop Wednesday
night somewhere in the general vicinity of northern Illinois and
northwest Indiana. As the storm system nears the Great Lakes on
Friday, additional heavy rainfall may occur. The general weather
pattern and the forecasted pattern of rainfall is generally
consistent with past heavy rain events in the region.
This outlook means that elevated water levels and potential impacts
are possible, but not yet certain. Persons should closely monitor
forecasts including the possibility of flood watches, warnings, and
advisories.
An updated outlook may be issued by tomorrow morning.</description>
