<headline>Freeze Watch issued October 10 at 2:44AM PDT until October 12 at 8:00AM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...LAKE WIND ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO 7 PM PDT THIS
EVENING FOR PYRAMID LAKE...
...FREEZE WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT
THROUGH THURSDAY MORNING...
* CHANGES...Added Lake Wind Advisory for Pyramid Lake today.
* WHAT...For the Lake Wind Advisory, west winds 15 to 20 mph with
gusts up to 35 mph expected. Waves 1 to 3 feet. For the Freeze
Watch, sub-freezing temperatures as low as 27 degrees possible.
* WHERE...Western Nevada Basin and Range including Pyramid Lake.
* WHEN...For the Lake Wind Advisory, from noon today to 7 PM PDT
this evening. For the Freeze Watch, from late Wednesday night
through Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Small boats, kayaks and paddle boards will be prone
to capsizing and should remain off lake waters until
conditions improve. Frost and freeze conditions could kill
crops, other sensitive vegetation and possibly damage
unprotected outdoor plumbing.</description>
<instruction>Check lake conditions before heading out and be prepared for a
sudden increase in winds and wave heights. Consider postponing
boating activities on the lake until a day with less wind.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
