...Probability of tropical storm/hurricane conditions...
Tropical storm force winds are expected this afternoon and tonight,
and typhoon force winds are possible. This is a steady trend since
the last local statement.
...Winds...
As Tropical Storm Bolaven (15W) approaches, sustained tropical
storm force winds are expected to begin later this morning. Maximum
winds are forecast to be in the 55 to 75 mph range with gusts to 90
mph. Poorly-anchored homes with corrugated roofs may be destroyed,
along with those of old or poor construction. Some homes of frame
construction could sustain partial wall and roof failure, and
possibly blown-out windows. Loose outdoor items will become
projectiles, causing additional damage and possible injury. Many
areas will experience power outages with some downed power poles.
Numerous large branches of healthy trees will snap. Some trees will
be uprooted, especially where the ground is saturated.
...Coastal inundation and surf information...
Inundation of up to 8 feet is possible as Bolaven passes nearby,
especially during high tide around 6 PM this evening. Hazardous surf
conditions will become dangerous as surf exceeds 15 ft along windward
shores this afternoon. Dangerous surf will likely continue through
Wednesday night. The highest surf conditions are expected to begin
along east, north, and south facing reefs today as Bolaven passes.
...Inland flooding...
A Flood Watch is in effect for the entire area. See latest
forecast for latest information. Listen for possible flood
warnings for your location and be ready to act if flooding rains
occur.</description>
