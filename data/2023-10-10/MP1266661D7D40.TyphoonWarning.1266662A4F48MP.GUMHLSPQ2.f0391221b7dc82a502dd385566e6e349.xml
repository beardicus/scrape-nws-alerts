Typhoon conditions are likely this evening and tonight. This is a
steady trend since the last local statement.
...Winds...
As Bolaven moves closer, the threat for sustained high winds will
increase, first coming from the north to northwest today, then
shifting to west to southwest as Bolaven passes to the north tonight.
The latest forecast is for tropical storm force winds from late this

exceeding 15 ft, for north and west facing reefs on Wednesday as

...Inland flooding...
A Flood Watch is in effect for the entire area. See latest
