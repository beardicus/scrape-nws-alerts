...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Bolaven is making its final approach of the Marianas and is expected
to pass north of Guam. All preparations should be complete. For your
safety, stay indoors until the worst of the storm has passed and
only evacuate if directed to do so by local officials, or if your
home is vulnerable to high winds or flooding. Heed the advice of
local officials and comply with any orders that are issued. Guard
against being stuck out on roadways when dangerous winds and heavy
rains arrive. Again, do not stay in a corrugated roof home. Remember,
pets are not allowed in most official shelters, so check ahead with
your intended shelter.
If staying in a home, turn the refrigerator to maximum cold and
keep it closed. Turn off propane tanks and unplug small
appliances. Fill the bathtub with water in case the tap water
becomes unavailable after the storm. This is for cleaning and
flushing purposes. Do not drink it.

inches possible. See the latest forecasts for the most up-to-date
information. Listen for possible flood warnings for your location,
and be ready to act if flooding rains occur. Soils are already wet
from previous rainfall, so it won`t take much to cause flooding.</description>
