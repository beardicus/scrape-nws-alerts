...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
...Probability of tropical storm/hurricane conditions...
Tropical storm force winds are expected. This is a steady trend since
the last local statement.
...Winds...
As Bolaven moves closer, winds will increase, first coming from the
north to northwest today, then shifting to west to southwest as
Bolaven passes to the north tonight. The latest forecast is for
tropical storm force winds from late this afternoon to late this
evening, peaking at 30 to 45 mph, gusting to 60 mph.
...Coastal inundation and surf information...
Inundation of up to 4 feet is possible as Bolaven passes nearby,
especially during high tide around 6 PM this evening. Hazardous
surf conditions are expected beginning today and continuing
through at least Thursday. The highest surf conditions are
expected to begin along north and east, and possibly south facing
reefs today as Bolaven nears. Surf will increase and likely become
dangerous, exceeding 15 ft, for north and west facing reefs tonight
and Wednesday as Bolaven passes to the northwest of the Marianas.
...Inland flooding...
A Flood Watch is in effect for the entire area. See latest
forecast for latest information. Listen for possible flood
warnings for your location...and be ready to act if flooding
rains occur. Soils are already wet from previous rainfall, so it
won`t take much to cause flooding.</description>

property. Evacuate if directed to do so by local officials...or if
your home is vulnerable to high winds or flooding. Within the next
