.STORM INFORMATION...
At 3 PM ChST, the center of Typhoon Bolaven (15W) was located near
LATITUDE 14.2N and LONGITUDE 145.6E. This was about 30 miles east of
Rota. Storm motion was west-northwest at 8 mph. Storm intensity was

.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
Bolaven has strengthened into a typhoon with maximum sustained winds
of 80 mph. Bolaven is on final approach of the Marianas and will
pass over to just north of Rota late this afternoon or early
evening. Bolaven will push off to the northwest of the Marianas late
tonight with wind decreasing by tomorrow morning. Heavy to torrential
rainfall has fallen over Rota and Guam. Heavy rainfall expected and
flash flooding possible for Guam and the CNMI through tonight.
.PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Bolaven is making its final approach and all preparations should
be complete. Stay inside and only evacuate if directed to do so by
local officials, or if your home is vulnerable to high winds or
flooding. Heed the advice of local officials and comply with any
orders that are issued.
For interests at ports, docks and marinas, preparations should be
complete. If you live on a boat, secure your craft before leaving
it.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for possible changes to the
forecast.
For additional precautionary and preparedness information, please
refer to detailed recommendations from your local emergency
management agencies.
&amp;&amp;
.NEXT UPDATE...
The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather
Service in Tiyan around 9 PM ChST or sooner if conditions warrant.
...Typhoon Warning remains in effect...
...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Bolaven is making its final approach and all preparations should
be complete. For your safety, stay indoors until the worst of the
storm has passed and only evacuate if directed to do so by local
officials, or if your home is vulnerable to high winds or flooding.
Heed the advice of local officials and comply with any orders that
are issued. Guard against being stuck out on roadways when dangerous
winds and heavy rains arrive. Again, do not stay in a corrugated
roof home. Remember, pets are not allowed in most official shelters,
so check ahead with your intended shelter.
If staying in a home, turn the refrigerator to maximum cold and
keep it closed. Turn off propane tanks and unplug small
appliances. Fill the bathtub with water in case the tap water
becomes unavailable after the storm. This is for cleaning and
flushing purposes. Do not drink it.
&amp;&amp;
...TIMING AND PROBABILITY OF TROPICAL STORM/TYPHOON CONDITIONS...
Typhoon conditions possible through tonight. The probability of
typhoon force winds is 60 to 80 percent for Tinian and Saipan and 80
to 100 percent for Rota. Winds expected to fall below Tropical Storm
force by Wednesday afternoon.
...WIND INFORMATION...
For Rota, maximum winds are forecast to be 80 to 90 mph from variable
directions with gusts to 120 through this evening, backing to the
south-southeast 50 and 70 mph with gusts to 90 mph after midnight. A
general concern should be for the possibility of moderate to major
damage somewhere within the area.
For Tinian and Saipan, maximum winds are forecast to be 75 to 80 mph
from the east to southeast with gusts to 90 mph through tonight. A
general concern should be for the possibility of at least moderate damage
somewhere within the area.
Winds will decrease tomorrow and become south to southwest 30 to 35
mph with gusts to 50 mph for Rota, Tinian and Saipan.
Poorly-anchored homes with corrugated roofs may be destroyed, along
with those of old or poor construction. Some homes of frame
construction could sustain partial wall and roof failure, and
possibly blown-out windows. Loose outdoor items will become
projectiles, causing additional damage and possible injury. Many
areas will experience power outages with some downed power poles.
Numerous large branches of healthy trees will snap. Some trees will
be uprooted, especially where the ground is saturated.
...COASTAL INUNDATION AND SURF INFORMATION...
Inundation of up to 7 feet is possible as Bolaven passes nearby,
especially during high tide around 6 PM this evening. Dangerous surf
conditions with surf heights exceeding 15 feet expected through
tomorrow. Hazardous surf conditions expected to continue through at
least Thursday.
...INLAND FLOODING...
A Flash Flood Watch is in effect for the entire area. Eight to 14
inches of rainfall expected, with locally higher amounts up to 20
inches possible. The highest amounts expected for Rota due to the
proximity of Bolaven eyewall. See the latest forecasts for the most
up-to-date information. Listen for possible flood warnings for your
location, and be ready to act if flooding rains occur. Soils are
already wet from previous rainfall, so it won`t take much to cause
flooding.</description>
