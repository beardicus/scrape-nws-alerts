<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 530 PM MDT SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Arroyo and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of north central New Mexico, including the
following county, Taos.
* WHEN...Until 530 PM MDT Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 116 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms over Alamitos Creek and Rito Angostura within
the Hermits Peak and Calf Canyon Burn Scar.  These streams
drain into the Rio Pueblo. This will cause arroyo and small
stream flooding within the Rio Pueblo downstream to at least
Vadito. Up to 0.36 inches of rain have fallen.
- Additional rainfall amounts up to 0.25 inches are expected
over the area. This additional rain will result in minor
flooding. The potential exists for flash flooding to develop.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Tres Ritos and Vadito.
- This includes the following highways...
State Road 518 between Mile Markers 48 and 58.
