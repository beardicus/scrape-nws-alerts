<description>...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
SATURDAY EVENING FOR GUSTY WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR
FIRE WEATHER ZONES 322 AND 326...
.Hot and dry weather is expected Saturday as an upper level ridge
peaks over the northern Plains. Minimum afternoon relative
humidities as low as 10 percent are expected. Southwest winds will
blow at 10 to 20 mph with gusts to 30 mph possible.
The combination of hot temperatures, low relative humidity, and
gusty winds may produce conditions favorable for large fire
growth Saturday afternoon and early evening across far
southwestern South Dakota. Local fuel conditions may preclude
fire growth in some locations due to the very hit or miss nature
of recent thunderstorms.

SATURDAY EVENING FOR GUSTY WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR
