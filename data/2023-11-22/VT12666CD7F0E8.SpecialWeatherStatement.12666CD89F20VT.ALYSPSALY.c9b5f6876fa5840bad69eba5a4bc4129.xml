<description>...A period of snow over the next few hours will be changing to a
wintry mix and eventually plain rain for the late night hours...
According to spotter reports and web cam imagery, steady moderate
snowfall is occurring for the Connecticut River Valley of
southeastern Vermont. Visibility is being reduced to under one
mile with the moderate snowfall. Some sleet and freezing rain will
begin mixing in with the snow over the next few hours, with a
transition over to plain rain by the late night hours. Before that
occurs, 1 to 3 inches of snow is expected to accumulate,
especially on untreated surfaces.
With this snowfall, slippery travel can be expected on many
roadways. Travelers are encouraged to slow down, use caution and
allow extra distance between vehicles.</description>
