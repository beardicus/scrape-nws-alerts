<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 21 at 2:32PM PST until December 24 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM WEDNESDAY TO
4 AM PST FRIDAY ABOVE 4500 FEET...
* WHAT...Snow expected above 4500 feet except locally lower near
Crescent and Gilchrist. Total new snow accumulations of 3 to 6
inches are likely. Wind gusts from the southwest at 30 to 50
mph are possible, at times, leading to blowing and drifting
snow, mainly in exposed areas.
* WHERE...In Modoc County, California, portions of Highway 139
between Canby and Adin, portions of Highway 299 at and near
Cedar Pass, and a portion of Highway 395 between Davis Creek
and Willow Ranch. In Oregon, portions of Highway 97 from
around Modoc Point northward to Gilchrist, and portions of
Highway 140 between Bly and Adel.
* WHEN...From 4 PM Wednesday to 4 AM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Additional snowfall with lower snow
levels is likely between the 24th and the 30th of December. Be
sure to check for additional details as that time frame nears
because travel is likely to be significantly affected by
winter weather, at times, during that time period.
* View the hazard area in detail at

* Carry tire chains and be prepared for snow covered roads and
limited visibilities.
* See https://www.tripcheck.com or http://quickmap.dot.ca.gov for
latest road conditions.
