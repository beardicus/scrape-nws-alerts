<instruction>Even light snowfall causes major travel delays, especially during
periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to
reach your destination.
Now is the time to prepare an emergency kit for your home and
car. If traveling consider alternate plans, remember to carry
tire chains, extra food, water and clothing. Once the major storm
arrives later Wednesday, travel may be difficult or impossible
for an extended period of time.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
