<description>...WINTER WEATHER WILL RESULT IN MAJOR TRAVEL DISRUPTIONS
THROUGH THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND...
Starting late Tuesday night and lasting through the holiday
weekend, a series of systems will bring stormy weather to the
Sierra, northeast California, and western Nevada. There may be a
period with lighter snowfall for the Sierra on Christmas Eve
before heavy snowfall returns on Christmas Day. However, travel
is likely to remain very slow with snow-covered roads and chain
requirements quite possible.
*  Sierra and northeast CA - Winter advisories and warnings are in
place...check those for details.
*  Western Nevada - Widespread spillover precipitation is possible
Thursday and Thursday night. However, snow levels are not
forecast to drop to valley floors until Friday or Friday night
so any impacts look limited to higher foothills above 5500 to
6000 feet. Therefore, the weekend offers the best chance for
accumulating snow in the lower valleys as a colder system
affects the region.
*  Consider alternate routes or adjusting plans if you are
traveling for the holidays. This is especially true if you`re
heading into or out of any Sierra locations where chain
controls, long delays, and potential road closures may occur.
Monitor the latest weather forecast (weather.gov/reno) and
check road conditions routinely (511 for Nevada and
1-800-427-7623 for California).</description>
