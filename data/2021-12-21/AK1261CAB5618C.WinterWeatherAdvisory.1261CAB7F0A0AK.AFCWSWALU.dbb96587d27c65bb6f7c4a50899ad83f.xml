<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 21 at 4:23PM AKST until December 22 at 9:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM AKST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow accumulations
of 3 to 6 inches. Ice accumulations of up to one tenth of an
inch. Blowing snow along the Kuskokwim Delta coast during the
onset of snow could reduce visibilities to as low as one half
mile at times.
* WHERE...Kuskokwim Delta.
* WHEN...From 6 PM this evening to 9 AM AKST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A warm front is forecast to advance toward
the Kuskokwim Delta this evening. Precipitation preceding the
front is expected to fall initially as snow. However, warming
temperatures with the front`s passage will support a transition
from snow to a mix of freezing rain and sleet from west to east
through Tuesday evening. Mixed precipitation is then expected to
change to rain from west to east early Wednesday morning as the
precipitation begins to taper off.</description>
