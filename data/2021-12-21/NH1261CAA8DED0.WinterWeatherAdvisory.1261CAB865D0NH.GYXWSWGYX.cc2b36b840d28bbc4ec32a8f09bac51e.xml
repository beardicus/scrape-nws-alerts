<description>...SLIPPERY CONDITIONS EXPECTED WEDNESDAY...
.Despite a coastal storm passing south of the area Wednesday the
preceding air mass remains quite warm and will invite areas of mixed
precipitation through the day. Initially much of the advisory area
will see freezing drizzle or freezing rain as precipitation moves
in. Once the storm strengthens some of the precipitation near the
mountains will change to snow. Close to the coast surface
temperatures may warm enough for a change over to plain rain.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM TO 4 PM EST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Freezing rain expected. Total ice accumulations around a
light glaze.
* WHERE...Cheshire County.
* WHEN...From 1 AM to 4 PM EST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will
likely become slick and hazardous. Difficult travel conditions are
possible due to icy road conditions. The hazardous conditions
could impact the Wednesday morning commute.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling. Prepare for possible
power outages. The latest road conditions for the state you are
calling from can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.
Be prepared for slippery roads. Slow down and use caution while
driving. If you are going outside, watch your first few steps taken
on stairs, sidewalks, and driveways. These surfaces could be icy and
slippery, increasing your risk of a fall and injury.</instruction>
