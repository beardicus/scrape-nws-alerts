WEEK...
.The first in several rounds of precipitation will spread across
Northwest California today. Snow levels will range from 2500 to
3000 feet across Trinity County this afternoon, and then rise

Weaverville. Precipitation will diminish Tuesday night, and then
increase once again Wednesday afternoon and evening. Snow levels
on Wednesday will generally be above 4000 feet. However, colder
air will spread across the region Friday into the weekend and aid
in lowering snow levels to 2000 feet across much of Northwest
California.
