<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM WEDNESDAY TO
4 AM PST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total new snow accumulations of 7 to 16
inches. Wind gusts from the southwest at 25 to 45 mph are
possible, at times, leading to blowing and drifting snow, mainly
in exposed areas.
* WHERE...Portions of Highway 58 near Willamette Pass, portions
of Highways 138, 62, and 230 in the Diamond and Crater Lake
areas, portions of Highway 140 near Lake of the Woods, and the
Mount Ashland Ski Road in the South Central Oregon Cascades,
Siskiyou Mountains, and Southern Oregon Cascades.
* WHEN...From 4 PM Wednesday to 4 AM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...New snow accumulations at Siskiyou Summit
on I-5 are expected to be generally less than 3 inches during
this time period. Additional snowfall with lower snow levels is
likely between the 24th and the 30th of December. Be sure to
check for additional details as that time frame nears because
travel is likely to be significantly affected by winter weather,
at times, during that time period.
