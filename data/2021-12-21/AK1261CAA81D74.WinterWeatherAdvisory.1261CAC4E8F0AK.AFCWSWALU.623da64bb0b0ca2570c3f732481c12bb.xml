<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 21 at 5:29AM AKST until December 22 at 6:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 11 PM THIS EVENING TO
6 PM AKST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow accumulations of
4 to 8 inches. Ice accumulations of up to one tenth of an inch,
mainly south and west of Sleetmute.
* WHERE...Lower Kuskokwim Valley.
* WHEN...From 11 PM this evening to 6 PM AKST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A warm front is forecast to advance toward
the Southwest coast Tuesday evening, eventually reaching the
Lower Kuskokwim Valley late Tuesday night. Precipitation
preceding the front is expected to fall initially as snow.
However, as temperatures continue to warm with the front`s
passage a transition from snow to a mix of freezing rain and
sleet is expected, mainly for areas west of Sleetmute. From
Sleetmute east, temperatures are expected to remain cold enough
to support primarily snow through the duration of the event. The
highest snow totals are expected from Sleetmute east. The best
chance for ice and sleet accumulations will be south and west of
Sleetmute.</description>
