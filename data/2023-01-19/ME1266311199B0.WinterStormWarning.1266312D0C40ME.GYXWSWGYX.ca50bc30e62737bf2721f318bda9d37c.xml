snowfall is expected for much of the forecast area. Some mixing may
occur at onset and across southern New Hampshire, but overall a
mostly snow event is anticipated. The bulk of the moderate to heavy
snow will fall tonight and early Friday. Some of the southern
portions of the snowfall may be wet and sticky, leading to an
elevated risk of power outages as snowfall approaches 4 inches.
Additional light and fluffy accumulations are likely Friday during
the day.

7 PM EST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snowfall with some mixed precipitation expected.

accumulations around a light glaze.
* WHERE...Portions of southwest Maine. Portions of central and
northern New Hampshire.
* WHEN...From 7 PM this evening to 7 PM EST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Periods of moderate and heavy snow will combine with low
visibility to create dangerous driving conditions. The hazardous
