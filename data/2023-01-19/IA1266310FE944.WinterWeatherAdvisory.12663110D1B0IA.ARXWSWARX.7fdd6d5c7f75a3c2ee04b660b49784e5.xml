<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 19 at 3:05AM CST until January 19 at 9:00AM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Snow Through Mid-Morning...
.Snow will continue to advance northward this morning with most of
the accumulating snow along and north of Interstate 90. There will
be some periods of heavy snow...mainly north of Interstate 94. By
mid-morning, the main area of snow should move out of the area
leaving behind some light snow for much of the area into the
afternoon.
In the heaviest snow, hourly rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour will
be possible, which will quickly cause travel conditions to become
hazardous.
With the additional accumulations this morning, storm total
amounts are still expected to be in the 4 to 8 inch range for much
of the area.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM CST THIS
MORNING...
* WHAT...Snow. Additional snow accumulations of up to two inches.
* WHERE...In Iowa, Fayette and Clayton Counties. In Wisconsin,
Crawford, Richland and Grant Counties.
* WHEN...Until 9 AM CST this morning.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning commute.</description>
