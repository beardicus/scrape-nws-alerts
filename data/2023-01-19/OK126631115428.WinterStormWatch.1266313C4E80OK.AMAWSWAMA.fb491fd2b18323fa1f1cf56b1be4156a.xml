<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 19 at 12:34PM CST until January 21 at 6:00PM CST by NWS Amarillo</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY EVENING THROUGH
SATURDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Moderate to heavy snow in the northwest Oklahoma
Panhandle.  Likely snow amounts of 1 to 3 inches, with the higher
end potential being in the 4 to 6 inch range. Winds could also
gust as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Cimarron County.
* WHEN...From Friday evening through Saturday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions and reduced visibility
from snow and blowing snow.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...If higher amounts occur, we could see snow
rates in the 1 to 2 inch per hour range, which would make travel
very difficult as well as road conditions would quickly
deteriorate.</description>
<instruction>Monitor the latest forecasts for updates on this situation.
Persons should consider delaying all travel. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution. Consider taking a winter
storm kit along with you, including such items as tire chains,
booster cables, flashlight, shovel, blankets and extra clothing.
Also take water, a first aid kit, and anything else that would help
you survive in case you become stranded.</instruction>
