<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued January 19 at 1:59PM PST until January 23 at 3:00PM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>...LONG PERIOD SWELL, SNEAKER WAVES, AND KING TIDES WILL CAUSE
HAZARDOUS BEACH CONDITIONS. ADDITIONAL RUNUP ON BEACHES POSSIBLE
THIS WEEKEND IN ADDITION TO MINOR COASTAL FLOODING FOR LOW LYING
AREAS THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...
.The highest astronomical tides of the year, commonly referred to
as the King Tides, continue to impact the coast and Bay shoreline
from through the 23rd and have historically resulted in the
localized flooding of specific low lying areas each year. The
lowest low tides of the event will be observed during the early
evening hours which may lead to trouble for mariners navigating
shallow waterways. In addition, long period northwest swell
arrives Friday evening, which will enhance sneaker wave and rip
current risk.
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 PM PST
MONDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY EVENING THROUGH
SUNDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding
expected at prone low lying coastal locations across the coast
during peak high tide through Monday afternoon. For the Beach
Hazards Statement, increased risk of sneaker waves and strong
rip currents along the coast, especially for northwest facing
beaches.
* WHERE...San Francisco, Coastal North Bay Including Point Reyes
National Seashore, San Francisco Peninsula Coast, Northern
Monterey Bay and Southern Monterey Bay and Big Sur Coast.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 3 PM PST Monday.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, from Friday evening through
Sunday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of areas previously impacted by King Tide
events is expected, including low lying lots, parks, and roads
along the coast with the highest high tides. King Tides in
combination with a long period northwest swell arriving Friday
evening will create risk for sneaker waves as well as further
runup of water near the coast and on beaches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Tidal levels will rise along the Pacific
coast but impacts will be more localized to areas such as
Elkhorn Slough near Moss Landing and the mouth of the Salinas
river at the Salinas Lagoon. Beachgoers should be familiar with
times and heights of local tidal levels and also use caution as
sneaker wave risk is enhanced due to incoming long period swell.
Sneaker waves in addition to King Tides could create additional
runup of water and can easily move logs, making for hazardous
conditions.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Tide poolers and beachgoers should also be aware that there could
be occasional waves running farther up the beach than normal. Do
not turn your back to the ocean. Don`t be fooled by an ocean that
looks calm. Avoid rocks and jetties. Avoid steep beaches. Stay
much farther back from the water and never turn your back on the
ocean.</instruction>
