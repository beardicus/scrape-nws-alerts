<description>...SNOW IMPACTS THE AREA TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY...
.After about a month with little snow to speak of, a significant
snowfall is expected for much of the forecast area. Some mixing may
occur at onset and across southern New Hampshire, but overall a
mostly snow event is anticipated. The bulk of the moderate to heavy
snow will fall tonight and early Friday. Some of the southern
portions of the snowfall may be wet and sticky, leading to an
elevated risk of power outages as snowfall approaches 4 inches.
Additional light and fluffy accumulations are likely Friday during
the day.

TO 7 PM EST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Moderate to heavy snowfall expected. Total snow
accumulations between 3 and 8 inches.
* WHERE...Portions of south central, west central, and western
Maine. Portions of northern New Hampshire.
* WHEN...From 7 PM this evening to 7 PM EST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Periods of moderate and heavy snow will combine with low
visibility to create dangerous driving conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the Friday morning and evening commutes.</description>
