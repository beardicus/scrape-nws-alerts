<headline>Flood Watch issued October 26 at 4:02PM AST until October 26 at 6:45PM AST by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...FLASH FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible, considering additional rainfall accumulations of 1 and 3
inches with locally higher amounts.
* WHERE...All of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
* WHEN...Through Thursday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water crossings may be
flooded. Extensive street flooding and flooding of creeks and
rivers are possible. Area creeks and streams are running high and
could flood with more heavy rain. Mudslides are possible in areas
of steep terrain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The interaction between an upper-level trough and a tropical
wave will lead to excessive heavy rainfall through Thursday.
Although the activity will gradually diminish, this favorable
scenario may last through the rest of the workweek into early
this weekend.
