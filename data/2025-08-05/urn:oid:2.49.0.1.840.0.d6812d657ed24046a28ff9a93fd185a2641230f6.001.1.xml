        <headline>Flood Advisory issued August 5 at 4:03PM EDT until August 5 at 7:00PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg SC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.

* WHERE...A portion of southeastern York County, South Carolina.

* WHEN...Until 700 PM EDT.

* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks,
greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and
parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.
A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.  A
small culvert washout or two is possible.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 402 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicates that the heavy
rainfall responsible for earlier flash flooding in York
County has ended and additional significant rainfall is not
expected for the remainder of today.  Storm-total rainfall of
3-6 inches occurred between 4am and noon, resulting in
excessive runoff and significant rises on numerous streams.
Most streams have crested and are receding below bankfull
levels.  However, routed flow from upstream floodwaves are
now impacting locations downstream of York and Rock Hill
along Tools Fork Creek, Wildcat Creek, and Big Dutchmans
Creek.  Tools Fork Creek remains above Action Stage,
resulting in nuisance flooding of adjacent low-lying areas.
Earlier, Big Dutchmans Creek crested near 11.4 feet, above
the Minor Flood Stage of 11.0 feet.  Now, Big Dutchmans Creek
is below Minor Flood Stage but above Action Stage,  causing
nuisance flooding of residential yards and wooded areas from
West Oak Rd to Mt Gallant Rd.  Meanwhile, Wildcat Creek near
Robertson Rd is still rapidly rising toward 8 feet, but
remains well below the Action Stage of 10 feet.  It is
possible Wildcat Creek will crest near 10 feet later over the
next 1-2 hours.

Earlier, York County Emergency Management reported several
secondary roads impacted by floodwaters.  People are urged to
obey all barricades, even if flood waters have receded, until
crews can assess road safety.

Areas of ongoing concern include:
1) along Big Dutchman Creek in Rock Hill from India Hook Rd
and Mt Gallant Rd near the Catawba River.
2) along Tools Fork Creek from SC 5 to SC 322 to Squire Rd.
3) along Wildcat Creek from Herlong Ave to SC 322 to Odgen
Rd.

- Some locations that may continue to experience nuisance
flooding include...
Rock Hill, Newport, Lesslie, Catawba and Edgemoor.

        <instruction>Keep children away from storm drains, culverts, creeks and streams.
Water levels can rise rapidly and sweep children away.

Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.</instruction>
