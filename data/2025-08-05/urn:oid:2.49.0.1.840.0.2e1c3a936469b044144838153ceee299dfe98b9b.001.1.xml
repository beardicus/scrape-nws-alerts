The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has issued a

* Flash Flood Warning for...
York County in upstate South Carolina...

* Until 445 PM EDT.

* At 1104 AM EDT, Doppler radar and automated gauges indicate heavy
rainfall due to numerous rounds of showers moving through York
County.  Storm-total rainfall over the past 6-8 hours has exceeded
3-5 inches, especially on the western side of York County near the
communities of Sharon, Hickory Grove, and Bullock Creek.  This
rainfall has caused excessive runoff and significant, rapid rises
on areas streams.  Areas of ongoing nuisance flooding are expected
to worsen over the next 1-3 hours as several streams may
significantly exceed their banks, resulting in areas of Minor
flooding across York County.

* Areas of greatest concern include:
1) along Bullock Creek and feeder drainages near Wilson Chapel Rd,
Hickory Grove Rd (SC 211), Ramsey Rd (Berry Branch), and Hopewell
Rd (SC 97).
2) along Turkey and Little Turkey Creeks near Shannon St (SC 41),
Hord Rd, and Burris Rd.
3) along Fishing Creek near SC 5, Park Place Rd, Gordon Rd,
Russell Rd, and Holland Rd.
4) headwater streams in the Rock Hill metro area, including
Manchester Creek near John Ross Pkwy and Big Dutchman Creek near
India Hook Rd.
5) along Wildcat Creek from Olde Creek Rd to SC 5 (Main St) to
Odgen Rd.
6) along Steele Creek near Carowinds and Pleasant Rd (SC 22).

HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.

SOURCE...Radar and automated gauges.

IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban
areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as
other poor drainage and low-lying areas.  Expect
extensive flooding of farmland, parks, greenways,
boat-access areas, and golf courses.  Inundation may
be several feet deep. Other flood-prone areas will be
impacted including low-lying roadways, low-water
crossings, underpasses, and parking lots. Several low-
water  crossings, roads, and bridges may be flooded
and impassible, with  deeper flows over roadways
possible.  Culvert washouts are possible and a few
impacts to structures cannot be ruled out.

* Some locations that may experience flash flooding include...
Rock Hill, York, Southwest Charlotte, Fort Mill, Tega Cay, Clover,
Newport, Lesslie, Sharon, Hickory Grove, Mcconnells, Smyrna, Lake
Wylie, Carowinds, Catawba and Bullock Creek.

        <instruction>Keep children away from storm drains, culverts, creeks and streams.
Water levels can rise rapidly and sweep children away.

Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.

In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
