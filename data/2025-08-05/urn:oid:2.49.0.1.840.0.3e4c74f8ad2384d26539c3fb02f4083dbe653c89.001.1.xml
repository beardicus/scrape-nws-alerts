        <headline>Flash Flood Warning issued August 5 at 11:27AM EDT until August 5 at 4:15PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg SC</headline>
        <description>At 1127 AM EDT, Doppler radar and automated gauges indicate moderate
rainfall due to numerous rounds of showers moving through the
Charlotte metro area.  Storm-total rainfall over the past 4-6 hours
has exceeding 3-4 inches across much of southern Mecklenburg
County.  The heaviest rainfall has occurred along Little Sugar
Creek, where isolated totals of 4-5" have been observed, including
near Starmount Forest and Sedgefield.  Flash flooding is ongoing
with additional areas of flooding expected to develop, especially
downstream of primary streams in the southern Charlotte metro area.
Ongoing flooding may worsen over the next 1-2 hours as the heaviest
rain begins to depart the metro area.

* Areas of greatest concern include:
1) along Little Sugar Creek and feeder drainages from near 36th
Street to Medical Center Drive to Hillsdale Ave and Seneca Place.
2) along Steele Creek and feeder drainages near John Price Rd,
Arrowood Mobile Home Park, and Carowinds Blvd
3) along Briar Creek and feeder drainages from near Shamrock Dr to
Independence Blvd to Colony Rd.

* The Flash Flood Warning was reduced in size to capture the areas
of greatest concern.  Northern Mecklenburg County is not expected
to experience significant flash flooding.  A Flood Advisory
remains in effect there due to continued concerns for isolated
nuisance flooding.

HAZARD...Life-threatening flash flooding. Heavy rain producing
flash flooding.

SOURCE...Radar and automated gauges.

IMPACT...Life-threatening flash flooding of creeks and streams,
urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses.  Impacts
to structures adjacent to drainages and streams are
possible, and residents and businesses are urged to move
away from streams.

Some locations that may experience flash flooding include...
Uptown Charlotte, Central Charlotte, South Charlotte, Southwest
Charlotte, East Charlotte, Northeast Charlotte, Northwest
Charlotte, Matthews, Mint Hill, Pineville, Marvin, Southpark,
Freedom Park, The Arboretum, The Plaza, Hidden Valley, Carowinds,
Paw Creek and Steele Creek.

The heaviest rainfall is moving through the southern parts of
Charlotte, including from Pineville to Matthews, and will depart the
area over the next 30-60 minutes from west to east. Expect flooding
headwaters to crest and for conditions to gradually improve after
noon with the resultant floodwave impacting downstream locations
closer to the SC state line over the next 2-5 hours.  The Flash
Flood Warning will remain in effect until most streams have crested
and conditions have significantly improved, with only nuisance
flooding remaining.

Isolated areas of Moderate flooding, with significant inundation of
flood-prone roads and a few structural impacts, are still possible
over the next 1-2 hours.  Drivers are urged to exercise extreme
caution and obey all barricades.  Residents and businesses are urged
to protect life and move away from streams.
