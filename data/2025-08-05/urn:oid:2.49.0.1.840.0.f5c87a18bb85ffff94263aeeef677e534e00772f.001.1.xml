        <headline>Flood Advisory issued August 5 at 6:58PM EDT until August 5 at 11:00PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg SC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.

* WHERE...A portion of upstate South Carolina, including the
following county, York.

* WHEN...Until 1100 PM EDT.

* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks,
greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and
parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.
A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.  A
small culvert washout or two is possible.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 657 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicates that the heavy
rainfall responsible for earlier flash flooding in York
County has ended and additional significant rainfall is not
expected for the remainder of today.  Storm-total rainfall of
3-6 inches occurred between 4am and noon, resulting in
excessive runoff and significant rises on numerous streams.
Most streams have crested and are receding below bankfull
levels, including along Tools Fork Creek and Big Dutchmans
Creek, where earlier nuisance to Minor flooding occurred.

However, routed flow from upstream floodwaves is still
impacting Wildcat Creek, Fishing Creek, and possibly Stony
Fork. Wildcat Creek near Robertson Rd is cresting near 12.5
feet, above the Minor Flood Stage of 12.0 feet.  Nuisance to
Minor flooding of adjacent low-lying areas is ongoing,
including near Squire Rd, where the backyards of some homes
along Kingsbridge and Londonberry drives are likely being
inundated.  Low-lying areas near Odgen Rd and Oakpark Rd are
also likely flooding.

It will take another 1-3 more hours for these lower reaches
of Wildcat Creek, Fishing Creek, and Stony Fork to recede
below critical levels.  Therefore, the Flood Advisory will be
extended into the later evening hours.

Areas of ongoing concern include:
1) along Wildcat Creek from SC 322 to Squire Rd and Odgen Rd.
2) along Fishing Creek from Bridgewater Rd to Odgen Rd,
Vernsdale Rd and Redwood Rd, Saluda Rd, Strait Rd, and Auten
Rd.
3) along Stony Fork, especially near Strait Rd.

- Some locations that may continue to experience nuisance
flooding include...Edgemoor.

Water levels can rise rapidly and sweep children away.

Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
