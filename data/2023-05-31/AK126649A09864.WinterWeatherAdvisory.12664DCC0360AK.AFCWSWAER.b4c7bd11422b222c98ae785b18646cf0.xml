<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued May 31 at 2:57PM AKDT until June 01 at 10:00AM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 11 PM THIS EVENING TO
10 AM AKDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Rain transitioning to snow before midnight. Snow
accumulations around 1 to 2 inches.
* WHERE...Copper River Basin, mainly through the higher
elevations of the Richardson, Glenn, and Tok Cutoff Highways.
* WHEN...From 11 PM this evening to 10 AM AKDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Another round of unseasonably late snowfall
is anticipated later tonight through tomorrow morning. Forecast
temperatures tonight should be slightly cooler than what was
experienced earlier on Wednesday. Thus, amounts of 1 to 2 inches
of snow are expected, specifically along the Glenn Highway from
east of Eureka to just west of Glennallen. Additional
accumulations of 1 to 2 inches of snow are possible along the
Richardson Hwy from Glennallen northward along the Richardson
Highway to Paxson into Isabel Pass, as well as along the Tok
Cutoff Highway to Mentasta Lake. Due to the temperatures being
just cold enough for snow, snow accumulations could be either
more than expected or stay mostly rain in some parts of the
Copper River Basin.</description>
