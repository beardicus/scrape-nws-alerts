<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued May 31 at 4:00AM EDT until May 31 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Dangerous rip currents and strong longshore currents in
the surf zone.
* WHERE...The beaches north of Cape Hatteras.
* WHEN...Through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water. Strong longshore currents will
create dangerous swimming conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most likely time for strong rip
currents to occur is a couple hours either side of low tide,
which will occur around 11 AM.</description>
<instruction>Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
