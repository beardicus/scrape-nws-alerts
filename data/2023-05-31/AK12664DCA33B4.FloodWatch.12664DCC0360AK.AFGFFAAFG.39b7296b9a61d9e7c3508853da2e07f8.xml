<headline>Flood Watch issued May 31 at 10:13PM AKDT  by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT THROUGH FRIDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall and snowmelt is
possible.
* WHERE...The Salcha and Chena Rivers.
* WHEN...Through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...Heavy rainfall combined with ongoing snowmelt over the
Salcha and Chena River Basins have already caused rapid rises
along both the Salcha and Chena rivers. Additional rainfall of
around 0.5 inches combined with ongoing snowmelt will produce
excess runoff and may flood low lying areas on the Salcha and
Chena Rivers. Water may encroach onto property and around prone
cabins. Expect increased debris in the rivers and possible
increased erosion.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Reports from the public of water levels at or above bankfull
as well as debris and trees in the water have been reported
on the Salcha River 30 river miles upstream of the gage near
the Richardson Highway bridge. Above bankfull water levels
have been also been reported on the Chena River near Two
Rivers.
- Http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood
- If you live near or along the Salcha or the Chena Rivers stay
alert and be prepared to take action.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
