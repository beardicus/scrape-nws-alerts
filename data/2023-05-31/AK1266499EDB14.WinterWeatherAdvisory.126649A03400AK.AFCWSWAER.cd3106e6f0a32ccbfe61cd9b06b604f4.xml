<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued May 31 at 3:17AM AKDT until May 31 at 12:00PM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON AKDT
TODAY...
* WHAT...Rain transitioning to snow early this morning. Total
snow accumulations around 1 to 3 inches.
* WHERE...Copper River Basin. Heaviest amounts from Glennallen
to the north and northeast.
* WHEN...Now through noon AKDT today.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Unseasonably late snow fall is expected
early this morning as rain and cold temperatures give way to
pockets of snowfall. Around 2 to 3 inches of snow from
Glennallen north and northeast along the Richardson highway and
Tok cutoff are expected. Amounts up to 1 to 2 inches west of
Glennallen along the Glen Highway and south of Glennallen along
the Richardson Highway. Due to the temperatures being just cold
enough for snow, snow accumulations could be either more than
expected or stay mostly rain in some parts of the Copper River
Basin.</description>
