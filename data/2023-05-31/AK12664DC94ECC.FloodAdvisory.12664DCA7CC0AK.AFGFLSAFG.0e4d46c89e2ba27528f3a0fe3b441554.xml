<headline>Flood Advisory issued May 31 at 4:27PM AKDT  by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY FOR SNOWMELT IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM AKDT SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by backwater from recent ice jams and
snowmelt.
* WHERE...Lower Yukon and associated tributaries from Graying
downstream to the Yukon Delta as far as Nunam Iqua and Kotlik.
* WHEN...Until 400 PM AKDT Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Backwater from ice jams between Russian Mission and the
Yukon Delta as well as snowmelt has lead to extensive overbank
flooding of lowlands on the Lower Yukon from Grayling through the
Delta, as well as the Innoko River at Shageluk.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 414 PM AKDT,
- The breakup front has already passed the delta, however water
levels remain high from snowmelt and the recent ice jams. The
USGS river gage at Pilot Station shows that the water has
only dropped about a half foot since its crest on Friday.
Satellite imagery confirms overland flooding in Shageluk,
Holy Cross, Russian Mission, Marshall and Pilot Station.
Water levels will likely be increasing for the the
communities of Emmonak, Alakanuk, Nunam Iqua and Kotlik, but
are unlikely to reach the levels experienced over the
weekend. Water levels from Graying through the delta will
remain high over the coming days.
- For Yukon River at Pilot Station:
At 3:45pm the stage was 29.28 feet.
