<description>...The Flood Advisory continues for the following rivers in New

San Juan River At Farmington affecting San Juan County.
.Snowmelt in the San Juan Mountains is driving up flows in the
Animas River.  These flows are combining with increased flows on the
San Juan River from the controlled release of water out of Navajo
Dam.  Water will be flowing quickly and may overtop the banks in low
lying areas. Exercise caution near the banks of the river as they
may be unstable.
...FLOOD ADVISORY FOR A DAM FLOODGATE RELEASE REMAINS IN EFFECT
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE...
* WHAT...High flows in the river are expected, with possible
overbank flow in low lying areas.

* IMPACTS...At 8.5 feet, Overbank flow is occurring from just below
the confluence of the Animas and San Juan Rivers at Farmington,
and continuing downriver through Shiprock. At this water level,
the fast flow can result in river bank erosion but otherwise minor
flood damage.
