<instruction>Get to higher ground immediately! Raging flash flood waters and
debris will inundate residences near State Route 188 along the banks
of Slate Creek.
Turn Around, Don`t Drown! National Forest Service Road 26 and low
water crossings through Slate Creek will be washed out and
impassable. Flood waters may overtop State Route 188 as culverts
become clogged from flood debris.
In hilly or mountainous terrain, there are many low water crossings
which will become dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross
flooded roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
