<headline>Flood Watch issued September 12 at 12:58PM EDT until September 13 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Boston</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY MORNING THROUGH THURSDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of northern Connecticut, including the following
areas, Hartford CT, Tolland CT and Windham CT. Portions of
Massachusetts, including the following areas, Central Middlesex
MA, Eastern Essex MA, Eastern Franklin MA, Eastern Hampden MA,
Eastern Hampshire MA, Eastern Norfolk MA, Eastern Plymouth MA,
Northern Bristol MA, Northern Middlesex MA, Northern Worcester MA,
Southeast Middlesex MA, Southern Bristol MA, Southern Plymouth MA,
Southern Worcester MA, Suffolk MA, Western Essex MA, Western
Norfolk MA and Western Plymouth MA. Portions of Rhode Island,
including the following areas, Bristol RI, Eastern Kent RI,
Newport RI, Northwest Providence RI, Southeast Providence RI,
Washington RI and Western Kent RI.
* WHEN...From Wednesday morning through Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of streets,
urban areas, as well as low-lying, poor drainage and flood-prone
locations. The Wednesday afternoon commute may be impacted by
heavy rain. Rapid-onset flash flooding is possible. Flooding may
be locally significant where persistent downpours develop and
especially areas that have seen severe flooding over the last 24
to 48 hours. This includes the potential for water in homes and
businesses, road washouts and structural damage. Small creeks and
streams may experience sharp rises to over bankfull.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Highly saturated conditions continue across much of Southern
New England, and some locations are still recovering from
severe flooding that occurred on Monday. A slow moving
frontal system moving in will bring another round of slow-
moving downpours and embedded thunderstorms from west to
east. One to two inches of rain are forecast, although
localized amounts up to four inches are possible. This will
worsen existing flooding and/or trigger new areas of
flooding.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
