<headline>Rip Current Statement issued September 12 at 6:06PM ADT until September 14 at 7:00PM ADT by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY MORNING THROUGH
THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Life-threatening rip currents due to breaking waves up to
6 feet, and occasionally higher.
* WHERE...Southwestern beaches of Puerto Rico.
* WHEN...From Wednesday morning through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Rip currents that can sweep even the best swimmers
away from shore into deeper water where it becomes difficult
to return to safety.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.</instruction>
