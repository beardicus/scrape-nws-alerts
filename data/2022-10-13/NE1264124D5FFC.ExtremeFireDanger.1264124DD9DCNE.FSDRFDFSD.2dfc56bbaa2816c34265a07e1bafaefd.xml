<description>.DISCUSSION...
Critical fire weather conditions are expected today, as strong
northwest winds continue, and even drier air works into the region
from the northwest. Despite cooler afternoon temperatures, we
expect humidity levels to drop into the 15 to 25 percent range
this afternoon. This will combine with northwest winds gusting as
high as 40 to 55 mph at times to create Very High to Extreme fire
danger. The most severe conditions, with lowest humidity levels
and strongest winds, will be across the James and Missouri River
Valleys. Meanwhile, southwest Minnesota will be on the lower end
of the spectrum, though still seeing humidity levels as low as 25
percent and wind gusts to 40 mph. A Red Flag Warning remains in
effect for our entire forecast area this afternoon.
Winds will remain a concern on Friday, as gusty northwest flow
continues. However, expect wind speeds to ease back to 20 to 35
mph, while minimum humidity levels also increase into the 30 to
40 percent range. Fire danger will still be elevated, but should
remain below critical levels.
Please be careful with fire...grass fires can move very quickly.
...EXTREME FIRE DANGER...
The Grassland Fire Danger Index will reach the extreme category
this afternoon. Extreme weather conditions and very low
moisture content of grasses, and other dry organic material
on the ground, indicate that critical burning conditions exist.
All fires have the potential to become large and spread quickly,
becoming erratic with extreme behavioral characteristics.
No outdoor burning should take place.
OUTLOOK FOR FRIDAY AFTERNOON...The Grassland Fire Danger Index
will reach the very high category.
The grassland fire danger product reflects fire danger for native
grasses. It is not intended for cured agricultural crops, nor
will it reflect conditions in road ditches which have been mowed.</description>
