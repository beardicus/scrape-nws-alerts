<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 27 at 9:13PM CST until January 28 at 12:00PM CST by NWS Chicago</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 2 AM TO NOON CST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy lake effect snow expected, with snowfall rates of
2 or more inches per hour possible at times. The highest snow
accumulations are likely to end up between 4 and 8 inches, over
mainly eastern portions of northern Cook and extreme eastern and
southeast portions of Lake County Illinois. The nature of lake
effect snow is such that snow intensity can vary significantly
over just a few miles. A slight eastward shift in the snow band
could result in the heavier snowfall missing eastern Lake County
and staying out over Lake Michigan. Western portions of Lake
County Illinois and far western portions of northern Cook County
could end up with less than an inch of accumulation.
* WHERE...Lake IL and Northern Cook Counties.
* WHEN...From 2 AM to noon CST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Conditions will be highly variable, potentially going
from just flurries to near white out conditions in heavy snow
over just a few mile stretch. Under the intense snow band,
travel will likely be extremely difficult, including during the
height of Friday morning rush hour.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The intense portion of the lake effect snow
band will result in visibilities of a quarter mile or less and
rapid accumulation rates, potentially exceeding 2 inches per
hour at times. Snowfall rates of this magnitude, particularly in
heavy traffic, can be very difficult for plows to keep up with.
If travel cannot be postponed, plan for significantly longer
travel times in areas impacted by the most intense snowfall.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
