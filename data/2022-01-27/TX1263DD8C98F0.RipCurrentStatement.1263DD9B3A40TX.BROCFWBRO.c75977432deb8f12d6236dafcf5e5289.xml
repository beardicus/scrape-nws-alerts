expected. For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip
currents.
* WHERE...Coastal Kenedy, Coastal Cameron and Coastal Willacy
Counties.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 9 AM to 6 PM CST
Friday. For the High Rip Current Risk, through Friday

* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding is expected, with water reaching
or pushing into the dunes on South Padre Island. Vehicles,
except those with four wheel drive and high wheel bases, will
be unable to be driven on the beach. This includes locations
north of Public Beach Access #3. Minor to moderate beach
erosion is expected. Rip currents can sweep even the best

water levels are forecasted to approach 1.5 feet above Mean
Higher High Water around astronomical high tide which occurs at
3:56 PM.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
