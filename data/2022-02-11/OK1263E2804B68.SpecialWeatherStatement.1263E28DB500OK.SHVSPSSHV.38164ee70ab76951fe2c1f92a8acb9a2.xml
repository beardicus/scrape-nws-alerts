<description>...HIGH FIRE DANGER CONDITIONS EXPECTED TODAY...
Southwest winds sustained near 10 to 15 mph with higher gusts will
combine with low afternoon relative humidity values of near 20 to
30 percent. These weather factors combined with very dry, dead
vegetation and dry soils will make for the perfect ingredients
for the possibility of wildfires. This enhanced wildfire risk
will be maximized during the late morning and afternoon hours.
The winds will diminish somewhat this evening but will increase
once again late tonight through the day Saturday in the wake of a
strong cold front. Look for post frontal winds late tonight
through Saturday to shift to the north with sustained wind speeds
near 10 to 15 mph with higher gusts. However, relative humidity
values will recover overnight into Saturday given the cooler
temperatures behind the cold front.
Extreme care is urged during all outdoor activities where there is
a potential for grass fires and for fires to start and spread
rapidly. Avoid outdoor burning of trash and do not toss lit
cigarette butts outside, especially from a moving vehicle where
winds can quickly fan a flame. Burn bans are currently in effect
for portions of the region, prohibiting outdoor burning. Report
all wildfires to the nearest fire department or law enforcement
agency quickly.</description>
