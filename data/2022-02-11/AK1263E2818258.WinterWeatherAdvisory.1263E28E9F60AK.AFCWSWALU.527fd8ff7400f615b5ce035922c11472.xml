EVENING FROM BETHEL WEST...
* WHAT...Blowing snow occurring. North-northeast winds of 25 to 30
mph with gusts to near 40 mph inland and up to 55 mph along the

* WHEN...Until 9 PM AKST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on hazardous travel conditions. The dangerously
cold wind chills as low as 30 below zero could cause frostbite

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The combination of falling snow and wind
gusts to 55 mph could produce intermittent blizzard conditions
along the Kuskokwim Delta coast, with visibility dropping to one
quarter mile or less at times. Conditions are expected to
improve from south to north through the late afternoon and
evening hours.</description>
