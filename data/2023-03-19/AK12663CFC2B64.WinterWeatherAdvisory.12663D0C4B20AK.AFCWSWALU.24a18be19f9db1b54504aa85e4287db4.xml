<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued March 19 at 4:33AM AKDT until March 20 at 10:00AM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 10 PM THIS EVENING TO
10 AM AKDT MONDAY FOR THE KUSKOKWIM DELTA COAST AND NUNIVAK ISLAND...
* WHAT...Blowing snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 3
inches. Southeast winds gusting as high as 50 mph. Visibilities
reduced to one half mile.
* WHERE...Kuskokwim Delta coast and Nunivak Island.
* WHEN...From 10 PM this evening to 10 AM AKDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel may be difficult. Areas of blowing snow will
significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Southeast winds develop this evening ahead
of a front expected to bring snow to the Kuskokwim Delta
tonight. The areas at greatest risk of low visibility due to
blowing snow are along the coast. However, blowing snow may
spread as far inland as Bethel as snow pushes from west to east
through the morning hours on Monday. By late morning, the front
exits east and steady snowfall will transition to snow showers.
In combination with warming temperatures, this will lead to an
end to the blowing snow threat by midday Monday.</description>
