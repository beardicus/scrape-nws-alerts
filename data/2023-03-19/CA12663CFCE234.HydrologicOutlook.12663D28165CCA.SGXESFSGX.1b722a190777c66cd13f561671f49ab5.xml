<description>Significant flow expected in the Whitewater River and the
Coachella Storm Water Channel by Wednesday morning...
Rain is forecast to develop over the San Bernardino Mountains and
northern portions of the Coachella Valley Tuesday through
Wednesday morning. Precipitation will fall as rain on the lower
part of the Whitewater Basin in the San Bernardino Mountains.
Rainfall of 1 to 2 inches is expected in the lower elevations of
the San Bernardino Mountains and San Gorgonio Pass.
As runoff accelerates off the San Bernardino Mountains...significant
flows will develop in the Whitewater River. These flows are
forecast to reach Palm Springs early Wednesday morning...and flow
southward through the Coachella Valley to Indio and beyond during
the day. The flow will impact low-water crossings and may create
dangerous swift-water areas through the valley.
The rain will diminish Wednesday evening...but some flow will
likely continue in the canal through Thursday. Residents should
be prepared for road closures and listen for later advisories.</description>
