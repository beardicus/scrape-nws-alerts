Hazardous breaking waves. Isolated coastal flooding and beach
erosion.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A long period northerly swell continues to

could suddenly produce larger breaking waves along the northern
beaches of Vieques. Breaking waves are expected to reach 15 to
20 feet, and beach erosion is posible.</description>
<instruction>A High Surf Warning indicates that dangerous, battering waves
will pound the shoreline. This will result in life-threatening
conditions.
There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.</instruction>
