<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM FRIDAY TO 10 PM PST
SATURDAY...
...WINTER STORM WARNING WILL EXPIRE AT 10 PM PST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Heavy wet snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 14
to 22 inches. Wind gusting as high as 45 mph, which could cause
reduced visibility due to blowing snow.
* WHERE...South Central Siskiyou County, including all areas
along I-5 and highway 89, as well as Mt. Shasta City,
Dunsmuir, and McCloud.
* WHEN...From 4 PM Friday to 10 PM PST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Areas of
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute. Gusty winds might bring down tree branches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS... Heavy snow rates are expected Friday night.
In combination with the high snowfall rates, there is a 90%
chance that winds cause blizzard like conditions with visibility
below 0.5 miles near Weed (including I-5) and possibly as far
south as Mt. Shasta City. The timing for these blizzard like
conditions would be around 9 PM - 1 AM PST Friday night.
