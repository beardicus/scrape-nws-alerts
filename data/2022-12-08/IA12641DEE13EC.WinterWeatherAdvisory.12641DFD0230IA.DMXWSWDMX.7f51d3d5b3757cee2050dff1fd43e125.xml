<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 08 at 11:15AM CST until December 09 at 9:00AM CST by NWS DesMoines</headline>
<description>...Hazardous travel from wintry weather later today into
tonight...
.A broad swath of precipitation will overspread the state this
afternoon and evening. Temperatures near to below freezing will
favor wintry precipitation types over northern into western Iowa.
The bulk of the snowfall accumulations are expected across
northern Iowa, where 3 to 5 inches should be common by late
Friday morning. The snow will create areas of hazardous travel
conditions due to slick and covered roads along with visibility
reductions. Just to the south, roughly between Highway 3 and
Highway 30, a glaze of ice mixed in with the snow is possible.
This would lead to slick conditions, particularly on elevated
surfaces such as bridges and overpasses.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 3 PM THIS
AFTERNOON TO 9 AM CST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow accumulations
of 3 to 5 inches and ice accumulations of up to one tenth of
an inch. Highest snow accumulations toward the Minnesota
border.
* WHERE...Emmet and Palo Alto counties.
* WHEN...From 3 PM this afternoon to 9 AM CST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact this evening`s commute as well as the
Friday morning commute.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
