<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING FOR THE BEAR BURN SCAR REMAINS IN EFFECT
UNTIL 1145 AM MDT THIS MORNING FOR NORTHWESTERN CARBON COUNTY...
At 1033 AM MDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing
heavy rain over the Bear Burn Scar. Between 1 and 1.50 inches of
rain has fallen. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin
shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through Crandall Canyon and Bear Canyon and onto Highway 6.
The debris flow can consist of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose
materials. Debris has already been reported in Bear Canyon.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms producing
flash flooding in and around the Bear Burn Scar.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Life threatening flash flooding of areas in and around
the Bear Burn Scar.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...

US Route 6 between mile markers 226 and 230.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry washes is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.</instruction>
