<description>...Snow showers to continue into the evening across northeast Nye
and east-central White Pine counties...
An area of snow showers will continue to affect portions of northeast Nye
and east-central White Pine counties through the evening. National
Weather Service observers, Nevada Department of transportation
webcams, and automated weather observing platforms are showing
light snow across portions of US Highway 6, 50, and 93 across the
above areas. Some locations may temporarily see moderate to heavy
snow with rates of one inch an hour along with a visibility of one
more or less. Cities and towns within this area include Duckwater,
Blue Eagle Ranch, Ely, Ruth, McGill, Great Basin National Park,
and Baker. The system will gradually work its way east and out of
the area, with snow diminishing from west to east. Accumulations
of one to three inches can be expected. If driving this afternoon,
please use caution as roadways could be snow covered and slippery.
Reduce speed and use low beams to arrive at your destination
safely.
