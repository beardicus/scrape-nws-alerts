<headline>Flood Advisory issued December 05 at 2:03PM AKST  by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>.Warm temperatures have caused ice movement across parts of the
Kuskokwim Basin.  This has resulted in swiftly moving ice jams and
flooding of nearby areas from ice action.
...FLOOD ADVISORY FOR AN ICE JAM IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 PM AKST
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam is occurring.
* WHERE...Including the following area, Kuskokwim Delta,
specifically the region around Oscarville Slough and Napaskiak.
* WHEN...Until 200 PM AKST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas,
including water over roadways.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 154 PM AKST, emergency management reported an ice jam on
Oscarville Slough near the advisory area. Impounding water
due to the ice jam will cause rapid river rises upstream.
- Cooler temperatures later in the week should allow streams in
the area to start to re-freeze and water levels to drop.
- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood
- If you live near or along Oscarville Slough or nearby stay alert
and be prepared to take action.
- The cold water temperatures can increase the threat of
hypothermia and lower the time required to cause hypothermia.</description>
