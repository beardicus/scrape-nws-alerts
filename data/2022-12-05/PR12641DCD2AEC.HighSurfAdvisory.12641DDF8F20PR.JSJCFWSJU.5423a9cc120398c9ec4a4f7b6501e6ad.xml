<headline>High Surf Advisory issued December 05 at 9:47PM AST until December 07 at 6:00PM AST by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AST
WEDNESDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Dangerous surf conditions and rip currents expected due
to breaking waves around 9 to 12 feet.
* WHERE...Beaches in Rincon and Aguada.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through at least
Thursday afternoon. For the High Surf Advisory, through at
least 6 PM Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surf conditions along with
localized minor coastal flooding and beach erosion. Strong
currents that can carry even the best swimmers away from shore
and out to sea.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.
A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in
the advisory area, producing localized beach erosion and
dangerous swimming conditions.</instruction>
