<headline>Rip Current Statement issued October 26 at 11:15PM ADT until October 30 at 9:00AM ADT by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AST SUNDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Life-threatening breaking waves between 10 to 13 feet,
dangerous rip currents, and minor coastal flooding and erosion.
* WHERE...Vieques.
* WHEN...Rip currents through Monday morning. High surf until
Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...Rip currents that can sweep even the best swimmers
away from shore into deeper water where it becomes difficult
to return to safety. Breaking waves that can cause beach
erosion and wash people and pets off rocks and jetties.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.</instruction>
