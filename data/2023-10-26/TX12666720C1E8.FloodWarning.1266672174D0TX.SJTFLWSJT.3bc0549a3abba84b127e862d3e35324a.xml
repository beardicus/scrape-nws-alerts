<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring. It is important to know where you are
relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become killers in
heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or creeks.</instruction>
