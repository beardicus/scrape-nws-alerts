<headline>Flash Flood Watch issued October 21 at 9:30AM PDT until October 22 at 5:00AM PDT by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>.An incoming storm system will produce a period of moderate to heavy
rainfall tonight across the central Cascades of Oregon, including
the Cedar Creek burned area. Please refer to the impacts below for
specific locations of concern.
...FLASH FLOOD WATCH FOR THE CEDAR CREEK FIRE BURN SCAR IN EFFECT
FROM 5 PM PDT THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH LATE TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Flash flooding and debris flows caused by excessive
rainfall are possible over and downstream/downriver of the Cedar
Creek Fire burn scar.
* WHERE...A portion of northwest Oregon, including the following
areas, Cascade Foothills in eastern Lane County and the Cascades
in eastern Lane County. This includes Oakridge and Westfir.
* WHEN...From 5 PM PDT this afternoon through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Heavy rainfall over the Cedar Creek Fire burn scar is
expected during the period of the watch. Heavy rainfall could
trigger flash flooding of low-lying areas and debris flows in and
near recent wildfire burn scars. Residents near the Cedar Creek
Fire burn scar should prepare for potential flooding impacts.
Debris flows could then move downstream along Salmon Creek flowing
into Oakridge, the North Fork of the Middle Fork of the Willamette
River flowing into Westfir, and Salt Creek and adjoining
infrastructure including Oregon highway 58. Debris might
eventually flow down river as far as Lookout Point Reservoir.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- National Weather Service Meteorologists are forecasting heavy
rainfall exceeding 1 inch in less than 6 hours over the burn
scar, which may lead to flash flooding and debris flows.
