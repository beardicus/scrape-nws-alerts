effects. Sensitive groups include people with heart or lung
disease, older adults, and children. When conditions rise to the
orange category, sensitive groups are advised to reduce prolonged

During Unhealthy AQI (red category) conditions, some members of
the general public may experience health effects and members of
sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects.
Sensitive groups include people with heart or lung disease, older
adults, children and teenagers, pregnant women, and outdoor
workers. When conditions rise to the red category, everyone is
advised to avoid prolonged or heavy exertion and those in
sensitive groups should consider moving activities indoors or
rescheduling.

Smoke from Prescribed burning in the central plains may affect the
air quality in Nebraska.  Smoke levels and wind directions are
monitored by Nebraska and other states to predict when impacts to
the air quality may occur.

Information regarding wildfires and Impacts in Nebraska is
available from the Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy
(NDEE) at https://dee.nebraska.gov/air/smoke-awareness-nebraska.

Alerts are based on data available from weather forecasts, smoke
plume modeling, satellite imagery, and from air quality monitors
located in Omaha, Bellevue, Blair, Lincoln, Beatrice, Grand
Island, and Scottsbluff.

Advisories for smoke and air quality are issued for affected areas
by the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and
Department of Environment and Energy (NDEE) and posted on agency
webpages and social media sites.  By notifying the media and local
health departments, alerts help citizens protect their health by
informing them of days where outdoor activities should be reduced
or avoided to minimize exposure to smoke.
