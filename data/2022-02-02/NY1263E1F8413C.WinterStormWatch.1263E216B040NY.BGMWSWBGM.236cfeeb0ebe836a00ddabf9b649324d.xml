inches.
* WHERE...In Pennsylvania, Wyoming, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Pike
and Southern Wayne counties. In New York, Sullivan county.

* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute.

cold front will move in from the north, changing rain to a mix
of freezing rain and sleet, and eventually some snow Thursday

south the colder air will move in, and sleet may develop at the
expense of freezing rain.
