<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY EVENING
THROUGH FRIDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation possible. Total snow
accumulations of up to two inches and ice accumulations of one
tenth to one half of an inch possible.
* WHERE...In Pennsylvania, Southern Wayne, Pike, Lackawanna,
Luzerne and Wyoming counties. In New York, Sullivan county.
* WHEN...From Thursday evening through Friday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Power outages and tree damage are likely due to the
ice. Travel could be nearly impossible. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Scattered rain and a few snow showers are
possible overnight, changing to all rain by Thursday morning. A
cold front will move in from the north, changing rain to a mix
of freezing rain and sleet, and eventually some snow Thursday
evening into Friday. Considerable uncertainty remains in how far
south the colder air will move in, and sleet may develop at the
expense of freezing rain.
* PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...</description>

your vehicle in case of an emergency.
