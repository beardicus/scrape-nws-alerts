THIS EVENING...
...BLOWING DUST ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM MST /3 PM PST/ THIS
AFTERNOON TO 8 PM MST /7 PM PST/ THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Blowing Dust Warning for localized areas where blowing
dust is reducing visibility to less than one quarter mile. At
other times and locations, blowing dust may not be as
restrictive with visibilities above one quarter mile. For the
Wind Advisory, north winds 20 to 30 mph with gusts up to 45 mph.
* WHERE...In Arizona, Parker Valley. In California, Palo Verde
Valley.
* WHEN...For the Blowing Dust Warning, until 4 PM MST /3 PM PST/
this afternoon. For the Blowing Dust Advisory, from 4 PM MST
/3 PM PST/ this afternoon to 8 PM MST /7 PM PST/ this evening.
For the Wind Advisory, until 11 PM MST /10 PM PST/ this
evening.
* IMPACTS...Severely limited visibilities are expected in the most
dense dust plumes. Travel will be dangerous and possibly life-
threatening. Difficult driving conditions, especially for larger
vehicles traveling along roads with crosswinds. Light,
unsecured objects may become airborne.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Blowing dust can reduce visibility with
little warning. Travel with care.</description>
<instruction>Be ready for a sudden drop in visibility to near zero. If you
encounter blowing dust or blowing sand on the roadway or see it
approaching, pull off the road as far as possible and put your
vehicle in park. Turn the lights all the way off and keep your
foot off the brake pedal.
Remember, pull aside, stay alive.
A Wind Advisory means that sustained wind speeds of between
30 and 40 mph are expected, or wind gusts of between 40 and
58 mph. Winds this strong can make driving difficult, especially
for high profile vehicles. In addition, strong winds over desert
areas could result in briefly lowered visibilities to well under
a mile at times in blowing dust or blowing sand. Use extra
caution.</instruction>
