<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 AM AKST
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected and periods of freezing drizzle possible.
Additional snow accumulation of 1 to 3 inches. Light ice
accumulations of less than a tenth of an inch expected.
* WHERE...Pelican, Elfin Cove, Petersburg, Wrangell.
* WHEN...Through 3 AM AKST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Wet snow may be
difficult to manage.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow showers and periods of freezing
drizzle will continue through early Thursday morning. As of 8
AM AKST, 6 to 9 inches of snow has been reported in Pelican,
Petersburg, and Wrangell. As of 11 AM, freezing rain was
reported in Petersburg. A lull in the heaviest precipitation
is expected this afternoon and evening. During that time the
