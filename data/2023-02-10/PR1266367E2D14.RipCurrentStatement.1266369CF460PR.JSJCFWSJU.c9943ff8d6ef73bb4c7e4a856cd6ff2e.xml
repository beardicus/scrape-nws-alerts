<headline>Rip Current Statement issued February 10 at 4:29PM AST until February 12 at 6:00PM AST by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AST SATURDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Dangerous breaking waves of up to 10 to 15 feet,
resulting in life-threatening rip currents and localized beach
erosion.
* WHERE...Beaches of Rincon and Aguada.
* WHEN...High Surf Advisory through 6 AM AST Saturday. High Risk
of Rip Currents in effect through Saturday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous breaking waves. Dangerous swimming
conditions and localized beach erosion. Breaking waves can
knock people and pets off rocks and jetties, which could
result in significant injury or drowning. Rip currents can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper
waters.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.
A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in
the advisory area, producing localized beach erosion and
dangerous swimming conditions.</instruction>
