<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AST SATURDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE SATURDAY
NIGHT...
* WHAT...Dangerous breaking waves of up to 12 to 16 feet,
resulting in life-threatening rip currents, minor coastal
flooding, and beach erosion.
* WHERE...Beaches of northeastern Puerto Rico.
* WHEN...High Surf Advisory through 6 AM AST Saturday. High Risk
of Rip Currents through Saturday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Minor intrusion of water possible over the coast due

<instruction>A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in
the advisory area, producing localized beach erosion and
dangerous swimming conditions.
There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.</instruction>
