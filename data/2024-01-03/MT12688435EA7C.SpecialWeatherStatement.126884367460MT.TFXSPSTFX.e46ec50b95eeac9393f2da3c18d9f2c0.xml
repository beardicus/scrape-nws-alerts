<description>...Reduced Visibility through Thursday Morning...
Low clouds and areas of fog have settled in across portions of the
Hi-Line this evening, with these low clouds and fog expected to
persist through Thursday morning before slowly dissipating into
the afternoon hours. While most locations will see reductions in
visibility to as low as one to three miles in the areas of fog,
locally dense fog with visibilities as low as one quarter of a
mile are possible in prone areas within the Milk River Valley and
along the eastern slopes of the Bears Paw Mountains.
Travelers should be prepared for changing conditions over short
distances. Slippery surfaces are possible across the region given
the fog and subfreezing temperatures, especially elevated ones
like bridges and overpasses. Slow down and allow extra time to
reach your destination.</description>
