<headline>Heat Advisory issued August 31 at 1:02PM PDT until September 06 at 9:00PM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...HEAT ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM FRIDAY TO 9 PM PDT
TUESDAY...
* CHANGES...The Excessive Heat Watch has been upgraded to a Heat
Advisory from Friday through Tuesday.
* WHAT...Very hot conditions with temperatures up to 100-105
degrees expected over the holiday weekend with well above normal
overnight low temperatures of 65 to 70. These temperatures will
reach or exceed daily records in many places.
* WHERE...All of western Nevada and northeast California,
including the cities of Reno, Sparks, Carson City, Minden,
Yerington, Fallon, Fernley, Nixon, Lovelock, Hawthorne, Gerlach,
Susanville, and Cedarville.
* WHEN...From 11 AM Friday to 9 PM PDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...A prolonged period of heat may significantly increase
the potential for heat related illnesses, particularly for
those without sufficient cooling or hydration resources, and
those working or participating in outdoor activities.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...While daytime high temperatures will be
near or above records, limited overnight cooling and the
duration of heat will exacerbate heat health impacts especially
for those without air conditioning.</description>
<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
