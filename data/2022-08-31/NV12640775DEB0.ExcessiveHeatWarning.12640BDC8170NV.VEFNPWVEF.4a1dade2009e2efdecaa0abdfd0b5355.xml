<headline>Excessive Heat Warning issued August 31 at 12:48PM PDT until September 04 at 8:00PM PDT by NWS LasVegas</headline>
<description>...EXCESSIVE HEAT WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL SUNDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Dangerously hot conditions expected through the week.
High and low temperatures of 8 to 12 degrees above normal are
expected through next weekend.
* WHERE...Portions of northwest Arizona, southeast California
and southern Nevada.
* WHEN...Until Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...A prolonged period of excessive heat will
significantly increase the potential for heat related
illnesses, particularly for those working or participating in
outdoor activities. Those without access to adequate or
reliable cooling or hydration will be at most risk, but much
of the population could be susceptible to impacts as well.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Minimum temperatures will struggle to
fall below 80 degrees for many locations, which could set late
August and early September records, including in Las Vegas.
This, coupled with the increased recreation due to the
upcoming holiday weekend, make this heat event particularly
unique and potentially impactful.</description>
<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
