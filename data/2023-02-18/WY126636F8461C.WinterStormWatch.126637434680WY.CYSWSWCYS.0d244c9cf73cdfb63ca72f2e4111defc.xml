<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued February 18 at 1:47PM MST until February 23 at 5:00AM MST by NWS Cheyenne</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 11 PM THIS
EVENING TO 5 PM MST SUNDAY...
...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH
LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Multiple rounds of moderate to heavy snow and strong
winds expected. Snow accumulations of 6 to 10 inches and wind
gusts up to 60 MPH with the first round tonight through Sunday.
Then, additional accumulations of 18 inches or more possible
with winds gusting as high as 80 MPH with the next round late
Sunday night through early Thursday.
* WHERE...Sierra Madre Range and Snowy Range.
* WHEN...For the Winter Weather Advisory, from 11 PM this evening
to 5 PM MST Sunday. For the Winter Storm Watch, from late Sunday
night through late Wednesday night.
* IMPACTS...Mountain travel could be very difficult to impossible
due to near zero visibilities in falling and blowing snow,
especially with the second round Monday through Wednesday.
Outdoor recreation could become life threatening to those caught
unprepared for severe winter conditions. Hikers, skiers, and
snowmobilers may easily become lost or disoriented.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...This will be a long duration event. While
there may be occasional lulls in snowfall, periodic moderate to
heavy snowfall with very strong winds will be possible from
Sunday through early Thursday, and possibly longer. Strong winds
and blowing snow with possible whiteout conditions will be
possible even during lulls in falling snow. Be prepared for
several days of difficult conditions.</description>
