<description>...COLD, WIND, AND SNOW RETURN NEXT WEEK...
The upcoming holiday weekend will be dry and mild with a much
colder weather pattern developing on Tuesday with periods of
stronger winds and snow.
* WINDS: Strong winds will accompany a cold front on Tuesday. Wind
gusts of 40-50 mph will be likely along the front, with possible
stronger gusts surpassing 60 mph in wind prone areas along
US-395. Wind gusts exceeding 100 mph are expected along the
Sierra crest. This will bring impacts for both air and ground
travel, along with choppy lakes. Pockets of blowing dust are
also expected across the west central Nevada Basin and Range,
which could affect I-80, US-95, and Highway 50 on Tuesday.
* SNOW: An initial round of snow is expected Tuesday and Tuesday
night, with a short period of higher snowfall rates and even a
rumble of thunder possible with the front. Additional periods of
snow showers will follow through Thursday night. Overall snow
totals could reach 12-18 inches along the Sierra crest, with
minor accumulation (generally under an inch) into the valleys
of western Nevada.
* COLD TEMPERATURES: Another round of very cold temperatures are
expected with high temperatures in the 30s in even the warmest
valleys, with teens and 20s in the mountains Wednesday through
Friday. Overnight lows will dip in the teens and single digits
throughout the region with some colder valleys dropping below
zero. Brisk winds will make it feel even colder, with dangerous
wind chills in exposed areas of the high Sierra dipping as low
as -25 degrees.</description>
