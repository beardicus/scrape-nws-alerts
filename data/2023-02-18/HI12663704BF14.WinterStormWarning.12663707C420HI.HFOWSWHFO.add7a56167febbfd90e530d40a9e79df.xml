<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING UNTIL NOON SUNDAY FOR THE BIG ISLAND
SUMMITS...
.A deep layer of moisture will continue to stream over the Big
Island through Monday. Temperatures at summit level will remain
near or below freezing and a mix of heavy snow and freezing rain
will persist through at least noon Sunday. Travel to the summits
is extremely dangerous and life threatening with snow and ice
covered roadways. Additionally, gusty winds will produce blowing
and drifting snow, as well as zero visibility at times.
...WINTER STORM WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON HST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow and freezing rain. Up to a foot of additional
snow is expected along with significant icing.
* WHERE...Big Island Summits.
* WHEN...Until noon HST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Travel to the summits will be life threatening and
impossible. The road to the Mauna Kea summit remains closed.
Blowing snow will significantly reduce visibility at times,
with periods of zero visibility.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Warning means significant amounts of snow, sleet,
and ice are expected or occurring. Strong winds are also
possible. This will make travel very hazardous or impossible. Any
travel plans to the summits should be postponed until the threat
diminishes.</instruction>
