<description>...Active Weather Across the Western and Central Aleutians Next
Week...
A series of strong storms will move across the Bering Sea and
impact the Aleutians next week. The first is a developing area of
low pressure expected to lift out of the North Pacific and into
the western Bering on Monday. The leading frontal boundary will
overspread the western and central Aleutians by Monday afternoon,
bringing gusty southerly winds, elevated seas, and heavy
precipitation. There is increasing confidence for stronger wind
gusts peaking 60-70 mph, including Adak and Atka, between Monday
and Tuesday morning. Additionally, there is a potential for
widespread gale force winds, with localized areas of storm force
winds becoming more likely. Conditions will briefly improve across
the Aleutians early Tuesday followed by a second storm system
moving into the western Bering by Tuesday afternoon. At this time
there is still some uncertainty with the exact timing of these
systems, but an active pattern is likely to continue into midweek.
Stay tuned for further updates.</description>
