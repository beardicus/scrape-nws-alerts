<headline>Red Flag Warning issued July 03 at 5:28AM AKDT until July 04 at 12:00AM AKDT by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>...Significant Lightning Over Eastern Interior Today And Monday...
.Red Flag Warnings for abundant lightning and extremely dry fuels remain
in effect through midnight tonight for zones 218, 219, 220, 221, 222,
223, and 224. The Red Flag Warnings may need to be extended
through Monday night.
A thermal low pressure trough stretching from Northway to Bettles
will remain through Mon then move east to Northway to Arctic Village
on Tue. This will cause very warm and moderately dry conditions, along
with smoke, to continue over the Interior through Mon, with slight
cooling on Tue. This trough will cause isolated thunderstorms through
Tue, with scattered PM thunderstorms along with gusty winds, small hail,
and frequent lightning along and northeast of this trough through Mon.
For Tue expect isolated thunderstorms over the Eastern Interior
with scattered thunderstorms in the PM east of Arctic Village to Denali.
Expect 5000 to 10,000 lightning strokes over Northern Alaska today
and Mon with the greatest density of lightning over the Eastern Interior.
On Tue most of the lighting will be southeast of Denali to Arctic Village.
Min RH should be 25-35% across the Eastern Interior today, then
increase Mon through Tue. The Eastern Interior should remain warmer
than normal and relatively dry from Wed through the end of the week.
