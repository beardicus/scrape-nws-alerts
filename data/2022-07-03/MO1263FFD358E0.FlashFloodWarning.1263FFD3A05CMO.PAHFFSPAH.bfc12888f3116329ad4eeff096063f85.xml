<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 715 AM CDT THIS
MORNING FOR SOUTHEASTERN JACKSON, UNION, NORTHEASTERN BOLLINGER,
NORTHERN CAPE GIRARDEAU AND SOUTHERN PERRY COUNTIES...
At 532 AM CDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated
thunderstorms produced heavy rain across the warned area. Between 2
and 5 inches of rain have fallen, with 4 to 5 inches of rainfall
estimated across western and central Union County. While the
heaviest rains have ended, it will take time for any ongoing
flooding to recede.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar and automated gauges.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,
highways, streets and underpasses as well as other poor
drainage and low-lying areas.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Cape Girardeau, Jackson, Perryville, Anna, Jonesboro, Trail Of
Tears State Park, Bollinger Mill State Historic Site, Cobden,
Dongola, Grand Tower, Altenburg, Ware, Daisy, Millersville,
Burfordville, Alliance, Makanda, Alto Pass, Frohna and Oak Ridge.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR AND GAUGE INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
