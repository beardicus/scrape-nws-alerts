<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 445 PM PDT THIS
AFTERNOON FOR CENTRAL FERRY AND SOUTHWESTERN STEVENS COUNTIES...
At 255 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated the heaviest rainfall had
ended in the warning area. However, between 1.5 and 2.5 inches of
rain have fallen. Runoff from this excessive rainfall is likely
continuing. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,
highways, streets, and underpasses as well as other poor
drainage and low-lying areas.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Twin Lakes, Inchelium, Hunters, Gifford, Cedonia, and Fruitland.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.</instruction>
