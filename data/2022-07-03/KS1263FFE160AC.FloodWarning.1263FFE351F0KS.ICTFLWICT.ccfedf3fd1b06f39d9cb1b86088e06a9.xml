<headline>Flood Warning issued July 03 at 9:27PM CDT  by NWS Wichita</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM CDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...A portion of Southeast Kansas, including the following
counties, Wilson and Woodson.
* WHEN...Until 1000 AM CDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of creeks, streams, streets, and other
low-lying and flood-prone locations is likely. Low-water crossings
may not be passable.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 927 PM CDT, Doppler radar estimated a swath of 3 to 6
inches of rain that fell earlier this evening across central
and eastern portions of Wilson and Woodson counties. The
threat for heavy rainfall has ended. However, excessive
runoff will cause localized flooding of creeks, streams,
streets, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations. Low-
water crossings may not be passable.
- At 8:52 PM, Wilson county law enforcement reported a few low
water crossings flooded in the Benedict area.</description>
<instruction>Do not drive into flooded areas or go around barricades. Nearly two
feet of water will carry most vehicles away. Turn around, don`t
drown.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.</instruction>
