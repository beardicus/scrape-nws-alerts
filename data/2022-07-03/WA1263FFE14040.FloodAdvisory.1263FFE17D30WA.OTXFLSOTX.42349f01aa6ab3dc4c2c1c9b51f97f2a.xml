- At 643 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms. Minor flooding is ongoing or expected to begin

<instruction>In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Move away from recently burned areas. The heavy rains will likely
trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep terrain,
especially in and around these areas.</instruction>
