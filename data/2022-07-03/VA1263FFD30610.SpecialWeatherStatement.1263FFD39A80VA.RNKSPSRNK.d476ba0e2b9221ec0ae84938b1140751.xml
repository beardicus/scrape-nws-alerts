<description>...Patchy Dense Fog to Hamper Morning Travel...
Moist ground and very light or calm winds this morning have
allowed for the formation of patchy dense fog especially in
valleys, low spots, and near rivers or other bodies of water. Fog
seems particularly problematic along the Interstate 77 corridor
from east of Wilkesboro northward toward Fancy Gap Virginia.
If you are planning travel through this region early this morning,
especially the Interstate 77 corridor near the Virginia/North
Carolina border, please be alert for areas of rapidly changing
visibility with some locations seeing the visibility drop to near
zero miles in fog.
Reduce speed, use low beam headlights, leave extra distance
between you and the vehicle in front of you, and allow extra time
to reach your destination. Please heed any Department of
Transportation or Law Enforcement hazard signs or notifications.
The fog is expected to dissipate by or shortly after 8 AM EDT this
morning.</description>
