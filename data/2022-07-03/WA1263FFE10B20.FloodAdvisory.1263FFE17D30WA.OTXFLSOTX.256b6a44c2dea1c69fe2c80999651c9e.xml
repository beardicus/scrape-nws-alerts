<headline>Flood Advisory issued July 03 at 5:08PM PDT until July 03 at 8:00PM PDT by NWS Spokane</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM PDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Areas near the 25 Mile burn scar in Chelan County in north
central Washington.
* WHEN...Until 700 PM PDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 506 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms. Minor flooding is ongoing or expected to begin
shortly in the advisory area. Between 0.1 and 0.5 inches of
rain have fallen.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Ramona Park Campground, Grouse Mountain Campground and 25
Mile Creek State Park.
- This includes the 25 Mile burn scar. Move away from this
area, as it is susceptible to mud and debris flows from heavy
rainfall.
- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood</description>
<instruction>In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.</instruction>
