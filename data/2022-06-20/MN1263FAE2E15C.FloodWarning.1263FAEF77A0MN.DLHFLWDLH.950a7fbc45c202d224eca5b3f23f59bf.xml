<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Once levels have peaked, it will take a matter of weeks to a month
for levels to decline to near normal summer levels. Additional
rainfall will prolong the time it takes for levels to recede.</instruction>
