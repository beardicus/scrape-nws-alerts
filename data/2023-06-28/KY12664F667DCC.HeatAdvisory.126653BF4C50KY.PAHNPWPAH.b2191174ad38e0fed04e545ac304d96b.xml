<headline>Heat Advisory issued June 28 at 4:11AM EDT until June 30 at 9:00PM EDT by NWS Paducah</headline>
<description>...HEAT ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM CDT/NOON EDT THURSDAY TO 8
PM CDT/9 PM EDT FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Dangerously hot conditions, with peak heat index values
around 105 possible both Thursday and Friday.
* WHERE...Southwest Indiana, portions of southern Illinois
northeast of a Harrisburg to Mount Vernon line, and portions of
western Kentucky north and east of Madisonville.
* WHEN...From Thursday morning through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...Extreme heat and humidity will significantly
increase the potential for heat related illnesses,
particularly for those working or participating in outdoor
activities.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...This system is tied to the broad area of
record breaking heat that has been occurring across parts of
Texas. As it moves this way, it will bring the potential for
highs in the upper 90s both Thursday and Friday.</description>
<instruction>A Heat Advisory means that a period of hot temperatures is
expected. The combination of hot temperatures and high humidity
will combine to create a situation in which heat illnesses are
possible. Drink plenty of fluids...stay in an air-conditioned
room...stay out of the sun...and check up on relatives and
neighbors.
Take extra precautions...if you work or spend time outside.
When possible...reschedule strenuous activities to early morning
or evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and
heat stroke. Wear light weight and loose fitting clothing when
possible and drink plenty of water.
To reduce risk during outdoor work...the occupational safety
and health administration recommends scheduling frequent rest
breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone overcome
by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location. Heat
stroke is an emergency...call 9 1 1.</instruction>
