<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT THROUGH 12 AM CDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has expanded an Air
Quality Alert for fine particle pollution. The Air Quality Index
(AQI) is expected to reach the Orange or Unhealthy for Sensitive
Groups category.
* WHERE...Portions of east central Minnesota.
* WHEN...From 10 AM CDT today through 12 AM CDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease
(including asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults, may
experience health effects.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Smoke from wildfires in Ontario and Quebec has
recirculated westward from Wisconsin and Michigan into eastern
Minnesota. Precipitation today may allow for some local clearing of
smoke - but in general the air quality will not improve until late
tonight into early Thursday.
