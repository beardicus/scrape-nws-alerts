<description>...Air Quality Alert for Wednesday June 28th and Thursday June 29th...
The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy
has declared Wednesday June 28th and Thursday June 29th...to be an
Action Day for elevated levels of fine particulate. Pollutants are
expected to be range from the Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups to
Unhealthy range with some hourly concentrations reaching the Very
Unhealthy range.
The Action Day is in effect for the following Michigan counties...
Berrien, Cass, St. Joseph, Branch, and Hillsdale.
Smoke originating from wildfires in Quebec, Canada is currently
impacting PM2.5 concentrations at the surface across state of
Michigan and will continue through Thursday June 29th. The Air
Quality Index is expected to range from the Unhealthy for Sensitive
Groups to Unhealthy range with some hourly concentrations reaching
the Very Unhealthy range.
Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including

prolonged and heavy exertion.
Reduce or eliminate activities that contribute to air pollution, such
as outdoor burning, and use of residential wood burning devices.
Reduce vehicle trips and vehicle idling as much as possible.
