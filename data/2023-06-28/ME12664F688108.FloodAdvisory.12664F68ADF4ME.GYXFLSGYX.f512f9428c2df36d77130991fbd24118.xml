<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 730 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Small stream flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
expected.
* WHERE...A portion of western Maine, including the following
counties, Franklin and Oxford.
* WHEN...Until 730 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
Overflowing poor drainage areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 527 PM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated heavy rain due to thunderstorms and rain showers.
This will cause small stream flooding. Overflowing poor
drainage areas will cause minor flooding in the advisory
area. Between 0.5 and 1 inch of rain has fallen.  This area
is prime for additional flooding due to the extreme rain that
fell across the same area this past Monday morning.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 0.2 to 0.5 inches are expected
over the area. This additional rain will result in minor
flooding.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Andover, Weld, Byron, Roxbury and South Arm.</description>
