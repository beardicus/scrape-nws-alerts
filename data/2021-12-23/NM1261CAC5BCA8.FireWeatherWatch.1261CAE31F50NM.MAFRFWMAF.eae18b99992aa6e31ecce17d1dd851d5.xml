<description>...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE FRIDAY MORNING THROUGH
FRIDAY EVENING FOR RELATIVE HUMIDITY BELOW 25 PERCENT, 20FT WINDS
OF 20 MPH OR MORE, AND VERY HIGH FIRE DANGER FOR THE NORTHERN
PERMIAN BASIN, SOUTHEAST NEW MEXICO, SACRAMENTO MOUNTAINS AND
FOOTHILLS, DAVIS MOUNTAINS AND FOOTHILLS, GUADALUPE AND DELAWARE
MOUNTAINS, CULBERSON AND REEVES COUNTIES...
.A shortwave trough will set up a jet max across much of New
Mexico and part of the Permian Basin, resulting in very strong
20ft winds across much of the region. Despite humidity remaining
mostly above critical levels on Friday, the high winds, record
breaking high temperatures, and ERCs in the 70th-90th percentile
will allow any fires that develop to have the ability to spread
rapidly and uncontrollably.
