<headline>Flood Advisory issued December 23 at 8:54PM PST  by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 245 AM PST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Urban and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of southwest California, including the following
county, Los Angeles.
* WHEN...Until 245 AM PST.
* IMPACTS...Moderate to occasionally heavy rainfall could trigger
shallow debris flows in and near recent wildfire burn scars
including the Palisades, Bobcat, Ranch 2, and Lake burn areas.
Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas will also be
possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 845 PM PST, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated moderate to locally heavy rain across much of the
area. Rainfall rates of 0.25 to 0.50 inch per hour can be
expected with any heavier rain bands. This will cause urban
and small stream flooding.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Long Beach, Malibu, Lake Los Angeles, Acton, Wrightwood,
Burbank, Pasadena, Palmdale, Santa Clarita, Van Nuys,
Alhambra, Hollywood, Downtown Los Angeles, Northridge,
Beverly Hills, and recent burn scars.
- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood</description>
<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas. The rain will likely trigger
shallow mud and debris flows, minor rock falls, and flooding capable
of localized damage, especially in steep terrain in and near burn
scars.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.</instruction>
