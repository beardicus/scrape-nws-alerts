<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM FRIDAY TO
NOON PST MONDAY ABOVE 1500 FEET...
* WHAT...Periods of moderate to heavy snow expected above 1500
feet on Friday. New snow accumulations of generally 3 to 6
inches at elevations between 1500 and 2500 feet Friday through
early Saturday morning. 6 to 18 inches is likely above 2500
foot elevations during that same time period. Additional heavy
snow is expected Saturday afternoon through Monday morning with
up to 12 inches between 1500 and 2000 ft elevation to as much as
2 to 3 feet at higher elevations. Winds could gust 20 to 40 mph
at exposed higher elevation locations during this time period.
* WHERE...Central Douglas County and Eastern Curry County and
Josephine County including portions of Interstate 5 between
Grants Pass and Tri-City, portions of Highway 199 in the
Illinois Valley, portions of the Tiller Highway from near
Tiller to Shady Cove, and the Camas Mountain area on Highway
138.
* WHEN...From 4 AM Friday to noon PST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Patchy
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...This warning period will bring periods of
significant snowfall from multiple waves of low pressure moving
into the area. While there will be some breaks in the weather,
expect heavy snowfall to begin to impact the Canyon Mountain and
Sexton Summit passes on Friday the 24th. Snow may lighten on
Saturday morning then increase late Saturday morning into
Saturday night and Sunday. Lowering snow levels with time mean
that travel impacts will spread to more roadways over time.
