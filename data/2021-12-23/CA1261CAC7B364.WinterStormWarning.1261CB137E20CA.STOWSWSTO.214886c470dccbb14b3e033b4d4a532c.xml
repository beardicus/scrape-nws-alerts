<description>...Multiple Winter Storms to Impact Mountain and Foothill Travel
through Next Week...
.A series of winter storms will bring multiple rounds of mountain
snow and gusty winds through early next week. Rain and snow
continue over northern California today, becoming more showery on
Friday. The next heavier round of snow will occur late Friday
night through Saturday with low snow levels. Generally 2000 to
3500 feet but lowering by Sunday morning to 1000 to 2500 feet,
locally lower. Showers are expected to continue over the
mountains between the two systems and on Sunday. The potential for
more significant snowfall is forecast for Sunday night and
Monday, with very low snow possible by Tuesday morning.
Major travel delays and difficult travel conditions are
anticipated through early next week. Gusty winds will further
reduce visibilities during this event with local whiteout
conditions possible. Holiday travelers should prepare for winter
driving conditions by packing chains, warm winter clothes, and
extra food and water. Foothill locations that do not normally
receive snow should prepare for winter conditions, especially
from Sunday morning through Tuesday morning.

TUESDAY ABOVE 1000 FEET...
* WHAT...Moderate to heavy snow expected from 1000 to 2000 feet.
Travel will be very difficult. Total snow accumulations of 8 to
12 inches, with localized amounts up to 2 to 4 feet, are
expected. The highest amounts are expected at or above the
upper foothills.
* WHERE...Northeast Foothills/Sacramento Valley and Motherlode.
* WHEN...4 AM Sunday to 10 AM Tuesday.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Be prepared for significant reductions in
visibility at times.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

roads and limited visibilities. Travel is not recommended while
the warning is in effect. If you must travel, keep an extra
flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case of an
emergency.The latest road conditions for the state you are
