<description>...WINTER WEATHER WILL RESULT IN MAJOR TRAVEL DISRUPTIONS ACROSS
THE SIERRA THROUGH THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND...
...WESTERN NEVADA VALLEY SNOWFALL EXPECTED SATURDAY...
A very active winter weather pattern continues as a series of
storms impact the Sierra and western Nevada this weekend and into
early next week.
WESTERN NEVADA:
* ICY ROADS: Recent heavy rain and freezing temperatures could
result in icy roads and walkways tonight into Friday morning.
Impacts to the Friday morning commute are possible due to icy
roads and continuing rain and snow showers down in the valleys.
* GUSTY WINDS: Gusty W/SW winds will spread across much of western
Nevada by Friday afternoon. Strongest winds are expected across
far northern Washoe County and through the US395/I580 corridor.
See the Wind Advisory for the latest details. Wind gusts of
45-55 mph possible through Saturday morning. Heightened impacts
to high profile vehicles and hazardous lake conditions expected.
* VALLEY FLOOR SNOW ON CHRISTMAS DAY: Snow levels will plummet to
all valley floors by Saturday morning. Several inches of
accumulating snowfall is looking increasingly likely beginning
Christmas morning. Expected travel impacts and snow covered
roads across all elevations. Up to an inch of snowfall possible
across western Nevada Basin and Range communities.
SIERRA AND NORTHEAST CALIFORNIA:
*  Winter Storm Warnings are in place through next week Tuesday.
Please check those for the latest details.
*  Consider alternate routes or adjusting plans if you are
traveling for the holidays. This is especially true if you`re
heading into or out of any Sierra locations where chain
controls, long delays, and potential road closures may occur.
*  Monitor the latest weather forecast (weather.gov/reno) and
check road conditions routinely (511 for Nevada and
1-800-427-7623 for California) or download the mobile applications
NVRoads (Nevada) and Quickmap (California.)</description>
