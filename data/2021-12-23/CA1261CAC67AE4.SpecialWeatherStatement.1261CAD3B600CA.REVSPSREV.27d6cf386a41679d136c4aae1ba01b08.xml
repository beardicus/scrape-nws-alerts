<description>...WINTER WEATHER WILL RESULT IN MAJOR TRAVEL DISRUPTIONS THROUGH
THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND...
A series of storm systems will continue to bring rain and snow to
the Sierra, northeast California, and western Nevada. There may
be a period with lighter snow for the Sierra and northeast
California Christmas Eve before heavy snowfall returns on
Christmas Day.
*  Sierra and northeast CA - Winter Storm Warnings are in
place...please check those for details.
*  Western Nevada - Widespread spillover precipitation will
continue today. However, it is expected to be all rain for
valleys with any snow impacts limited to foothills and ranges
above 5500 to 6500 feet tonight into early Friday. Snow
showers could briefly reach valley floors in far western Nevada
Friday morning but impacts look limited with temperatures in
the 30s. The chance for snow in the valleys increases Christmas
Day as a cold front moves through.
*  A period of strong gusty winds will be possible through early
afternoon across Mineral and Southern Lyon counties,
especially along Highway 95 near Walker Lake. Brief wind gusts
of 50 to 60 mph are possible in these wind prone areas, out
ahead of the heavier precipitation.
*  Consider alternate routes or adjusting plans if you are
traveling for the holidays. This is especially true if you`re
heading into or out of any Sierra locations where chain
controls, long delays, and potential road closures may occur.
Monitor the latest weather forecast (weather.gov/reno) and
check road conditions routinely (511 for Nevada and
1-800-427-7623 for California) or download the mobile
applications NVRoads (Nevada) and Quickmap (California).</description>
