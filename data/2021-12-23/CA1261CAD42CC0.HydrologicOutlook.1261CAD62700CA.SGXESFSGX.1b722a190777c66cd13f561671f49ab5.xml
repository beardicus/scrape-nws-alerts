<description>...Significant flow expected in the Whitewater River and the
Coachella Storm Water Channel expected late tonight and Friday...
Heavy rain is impacting the mountains of San Bernardino County
this evening with totals of 2 to 3 inches having already occurred.
Heavy rainfall will continue across the mountains through the
night tonight and spread across the northern part of the
Coachella Valley later tonight into Friday morning. This rainfall
will lead to significant run off into the Whitewater River wash.
Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches are expected over the mountain
slopes by Friday morning...with totals of 1 to 3 inches expected
across the lower elevations.
As the soils become saturated and runoff accelerates off the San
Bernardino Mountains...significant flows will develop in the
Whitewater River. These flows may reach Palm Springs Friday
morning...and flow southward through the Coachella Valley to Indio
and beyond during the day. The flow will impact low-water
crossings and may create dangerous swift-water areas through the
valley.
The rain will diminish Friday afternoon...but some flow will
likely continue in the canal through Friday night. Residents
should be prepared for road closures and listen for later
advisories.</description>
