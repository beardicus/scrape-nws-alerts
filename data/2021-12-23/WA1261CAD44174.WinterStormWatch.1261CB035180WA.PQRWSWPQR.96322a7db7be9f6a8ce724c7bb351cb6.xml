<instruction>Anyone with travel plans should stay aware of the latest weather
information and have alternative travel plans, or delay travel,
if possible.
Be prepared for winter driving conditions with snow and ice
covered roads and very limited visibility. If you must travel,
slow down, and allow plenty of extra time to reach your
destination. Allow extra following distance to the vehicle in
front of you, and keep snow chains and a winter survival kit,
including a flashlight, food, and water in your vehicle in case
of an emergency.
Monitor the latest forecasts for updates on this situation.</instruction>
