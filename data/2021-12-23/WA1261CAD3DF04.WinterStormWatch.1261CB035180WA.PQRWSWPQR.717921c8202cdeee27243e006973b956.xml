<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued December 23 at 5:05PM PST until December 27 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...AN INCREASINGLY COLD AND SNOWY HOLIDAY WEEKEND IN STORE...
.A series of storms will continue to affect the region, with a round
of heavy snow above 1500-2000 feet Friday. A colder airmass will
then slide down into the region and push snow levels to sea level
Christmas night. Expect widespread off and on snow showers for
northwestern Oregon and southwestern Washington Saturday night
through early Monday morning.
...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
LATE SUNDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations ranging from
a dusting to 6 inches. The highest amounts will likely fall above
500 feet such as the hills above Kelso/Longview and the West Hills
of Portland. In addition, the highest amounts will also likely
fall well east of Interstate 5 near the foothills of the Cascades
including places such as Yacolt, Battle Ground, Camas, Washougal,
Troutdale and Gresham. The lowest amounts will generally fall at
the lowest elevations west of Interstate 5, but cannot rule out
localized higher amounts even in these areas as well. Amounts will
likely vary over small distances given the showery nature of the
precipitation.
* WHERE...In Washington, I-5 Corridor in Cowlitz County and Greater
Vancouver Area. In Oregon, Lower Columbia and Greater Portland
Metro Area.
* WHEN...From late Saturday afternoon through late Sunday night.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult.</description>
<instruction>Anyone with travel plans should stay aware of the latest weather
information and have alternative travel plans, or delay travel,
if possible.
Be prepared for winter driving conditions with snow and ice
covered roads and very limited visibility. If you must travel,
slow down, and allow plenty of extra time to reach your
destination. Allow extra following distance to the vehicle in
front of you, and keep snow chains and a winter survival kit,
including a flashlight, food, and water in your vehicle in case of
an emergency.
Monitor the latest forecasts for updates on this situation.</instruction>
