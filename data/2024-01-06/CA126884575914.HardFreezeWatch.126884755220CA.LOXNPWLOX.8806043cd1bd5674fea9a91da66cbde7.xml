<description>...WIND ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM THIS EVENING TO 7 PM
PST SUNDAY...
...HARD FREEZE WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH
MONDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...For the Wind Advisory, northwest winds 15 to 25 mph with
gusts up to 40 mph expected. For the Hard Freeze Watch, sub-
freezing temperatures as low as 24 possible.
* WHERE...Cuyama Valley.
* WHEN...For the Wind Advisory, from 7 PM this evening to 7 PM
PST Sunday. For the Hard Freeze Watch, from late Sunday night
through Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...Gusty winds will blow around unsecured objects and
make driving difficult, especially for high profile vehicles.
Tree limbs could be blown down and a few power outages may
result. Freezing conditions could kill crops, other sensitive
vegetation and possibly damage unprotected outdoor plumbing.</description>
<instruction>Use extra caution when driving, especially if operating a high
profile vehicle. Secure outdoor objects.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
