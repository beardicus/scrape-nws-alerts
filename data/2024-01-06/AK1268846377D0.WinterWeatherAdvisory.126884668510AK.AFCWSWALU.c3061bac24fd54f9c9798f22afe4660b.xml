<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 06 at 4:00PM AKST until January 07 at 12:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON AKST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 4 to 8 inches.
Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Lower Kuskokwim Valley from Sleetmute to Aniak.
* WHEN...Until noon AKST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on difficult travel conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A long duration of light to moderate snow
is expected as a front stalls out over Southwest Alaska this
weekend. Temperatures are expected to be near freezing, leading
to wet and heavy snow. There is a chance that rain could mix
with snow, which could lead to lower snow amounts. The strongest
winds are expected in areas of lower snow rates so the amount
of blowing snow should be limited.</description>
