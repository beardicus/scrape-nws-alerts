<headline>High Surf Advisory issued January 06 at 10:35PM PST until January 07 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM PST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Large waves and hazardous surf conditions. Breakers up to
22 feet.
* WHERE...In Oregon, North Oregon Coast and Central Oregon
Coast. In Washington, South Washington Coast.
* WHEN...Until 4 AM PST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Destructive waves may wash over beaches, jetties,
and other structures unexpectedly. People can be swept off
rocks and jetties and drown while observing high surf. Minor
beach erosion may damage coastal properties and buildings.
Higher than normal water run-up is expected on beaches and low-
lying shoreline.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Surfing, swimming, fishing, boating, and
observing large waves from rocks or coastal structures during
high surf conditions is dangerous. All large waves are not
alike. There is often an extra large breaker that can suddenly
sweep a person overboard or off a large rock with no warning.
The safest place to be during high surf conditions is in port
and well away from breaking waves.</description>
<instruction>A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches,
producing rip currents, sneaker waves and beach erosion. Stay
well back from the water`s edge and be alert for exceptionally
high waves.
Keep away from large logs on the beach. Water running up on the
beach can easily lift or roll logs which can injure or kill
someone caught in their path.</instruction>
