<description>...A SIGNIFICANT PATTERN CHANGE IS IN STORE THIS UPCOMING WEEK...
...A PERIOD OF HEAVY MOUNTAIN SNOW IS POSSIBLE TUESDAY INTO
WEDNESDAY...
...COLDER TEMPERATURES BY THE END OF THE WEEK...
After a very warm December and start to January, a significant
weather pattern change is in store this upcoming week.
The week will start out relatively mild, but a storm will affect
the region beginning Tuesday and continue into Wednesday. A cold
front will cross the region and abundant moisture will bring heavy
mountain snow to the Cascades and Blue Mountains beginning Tuesday
and continue into Wednesday. One to two feet of snow is possible
above 2500 feet, with locally higher amounts. The cold front will
also cause about a 10 degree drop in temperatures between Tuesday
and Wednesday
Additionally, it will be breezy to windy on Tuesday, especially in
the morning, with wind gusts greater than 50 mph across the
Cascade Gaps and Columbia Basin and wind gusts greater than 30 mph
in most locations. Wind gusts will decrease during the day but
still remain above 30 mph. These winds will cause blowing and
drifting of snow. Anyone with travel plans over the Cascade passes
or Blue Mountains should be prepared for dangerous travel
conditions due to a combination of heavy snow and blowing snow.
By Friday into next weekend, while there is still considerable
uncertainty, there is the potential for the coldest temperatures
of this winter season. Model guidance varies substantially at this
point and confidence is low (25 to 30%). However, there is the
possibility that high temperatures may not get above freezing,
with overnight lows in the teens.
Since the potential cold temperatures are about a week away,
please monitor the forecast for potential changes, updates and
additional updates over the next several days.</description>
