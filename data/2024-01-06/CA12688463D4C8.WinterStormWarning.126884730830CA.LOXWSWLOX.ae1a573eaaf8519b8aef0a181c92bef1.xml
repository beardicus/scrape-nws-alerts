<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM PST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Light to moderate snow is expected, and will combine
with damaging northwest to north winds. Snow accumulations of
2 to 5 inches are expected above 4500 feet, with accumulations
of 1 to 3 inches between 3500 and 4500 feet, except a dusting
to 2 inches for the Lockwood Valley. Northwest winds 30 to 40
mph with gusts to 60 to 70 mph are expected tonight and Sunday
morning. Localized gusts to 80 mph are possible.
* WHERE...Northern Ventura County Mountains and Interstate 5
Corridor in LA county mountains.
* WHEN...Until 7 PM PST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult due to low visibilities
and snow/ice covered roads with localized blizzard conditions
likely. Very strong winds may cause extensive tree damage.
Interstate 5 near the Grapevine will likely become hazardous for
driving tonight into Sunday morning due to the combination of
snow, ice, and strong winds which may cause delays or closure.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow will likely come to a end by Sunday
afternoon, but strong winds will continue to cause reduced
visibility at times due to blowing snow through Sunday evening.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
