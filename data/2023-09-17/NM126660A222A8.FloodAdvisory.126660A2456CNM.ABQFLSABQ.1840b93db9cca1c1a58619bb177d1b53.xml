<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.

steep, narrow canyons. Know where you are relative to low spots and
drainages.
Remember, ditches are deadly. A gentle flow of water can become a
raging torrent in a few minutes.</instruction>
