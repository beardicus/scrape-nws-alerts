<description>...TWO ROUNDS OF INCLEMENT/WINTRY WEATHER TONIGHT-SUNDAY AND
AGAIN MONDAY-TUESDAY...
Rainfall will spread northward into the region this evening. This
rain is forecast to change to snow from west to east across the
area late tonight through the day Sunday. Uncertainties on when
precipitation changes to snow, as well as surface temperatures
make snowfall ranges anywhere from a trace to 1 inch, to as much
as 4 or 5 inches. Light icing is also possible along the
transition zone as it tracks east.
A larger and stronger system is expected to move into the area
Monday through Tuesday, with totals in excess of 6 inches becoming
more and more possible. Strong north winds gusting over 40 mph
will also bring blowing snow and visibility concerns. Stay tuned
to the latest forecasts regarding these two impactful storm system
over the coming days.</description>
