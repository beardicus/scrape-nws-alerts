<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 23 at 6:03PM CST until December 24 at 6:00PM CST by NWS Goodland</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 11 PM MST
/MIDNIGHT CST/ THIS EVENING TO 5 PM MST /6 PM CST/ SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Snow and blowing snow. Total snow accumulations ranging
anywhere from half an inch to five inches. North to northwest
winds sustained at 25 to 35 mph with gusts up to 50 mph.
* WHERE...Yuma, Kit Carson and Cheyenne Counties in Colorado,
Sherman, Cheyenne and Rawlins counties in Kansas and Dundy and
Hitchcock counties in Nebraska.
* WHEN...Beginning late tonight and ending by sunset Sunday
evening.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous travel conditions associated with snow,
blowing snow and breezy to strong north winds. Locally heavy
snow and blizzard conditions are possible, at times, Sunday
morning. This includes the Interstate 70 corridor from Flagler,
Colorado to Brewster, Kansas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Bands of precipitation, initially in the
form of rain, will rapidly develop across portions of the
advisory area late this evening and overnight. Precipitation is
anticipated to transition from rain to snow between 2 AM and 4
AM MST as breezy to strong north winds usher a colder airmass
into the region. Locally heavy snow and blizzard conditions are
possible at times, mainly between 4 AM and 11 AM MST Sunday
morning, when the majority of precipitation is anticipated to
occur. Conditions may vary considerably from county to county,
or even within the same county.</description>
<instruction>Consider alternate travel plans. If you must travel, keep an
extra flashlight, food, and water in your vehicle in case of an
emergency. The latest road conditions for the state you are
calling from can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
