<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 23 at 3:50AM CST until December 24 at 6:00PM CST by NWS Goodland</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 11 PM MST /MIDNIGHT
CST/ THIS EVENING TO 5 PM MST /6 PM CST/ SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Blowing and accumulating snow is expected. North winds
gusting around 45 mph resulting in reduced visibility.
* WHERE...In Kansas, Cheyenne and Sherman Counties. In Nebraska,
Dundy County.
* WHEN...From 11 PM MST /midnight CST/ this evening to 5 PM MST
/6 PM CST/ Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slick road conditions. Blowing snow could
significantly reduce visibility. Gusty winds combined with wet
snow could bring down tree branches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...There is potential for a heavy snow band to
develop which would bring significantly higher snowfall totals
and greater impacts. Strong north winds and falling snow may
bring near blizzard to localized blizzard conditions, be
prepared for difficult holiday travel. The heaviest snow looks
to fall during the morning hours before waning through the
afternoon. Blowing snow may still be possible if snow is able to
accumulate.</description>
