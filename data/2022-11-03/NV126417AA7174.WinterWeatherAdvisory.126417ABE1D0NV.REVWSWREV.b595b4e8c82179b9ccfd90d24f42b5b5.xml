<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued November 03 at 12:57AM PDT until November 03 at 10:00AM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PDT THIS
MORNING FOR ICY ROADS AND LAKE-EFFECT SNOW BANDS...
* WHAT...Snow. Additional snow accumulations of up to one inch,
except 1-4 inches of lake-effect snow for portions of Douglas
County and south of Pyramid Lake. Roads that are initially wet
could rapidly become icy and hazardous early this morning.
* WHERE...Greater Reno-Carson City-Minden Area.
* WHEN...Until 10 AM PDT this morning.
* IMPACTS...Snow showers overnight combined with temperatures
below freezing could lead to widespread icy road conditions
across far western Nevada through this morning`s commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Heavier snow accumulations are most likely
along US-395 between Carson City and Minden-Gardnerville, and
also parts of Pyramid Highway and NV-446 between Sutcliffe and
Nixon. Visibility could rapidly drop to less than 1/2 mile when
encountering these lake-effect snow bands.</description>
<instruction>Even light snowfall causes major travel delays, especially during
periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to
reach your destination. Leave plenty of extra space between
vehicles since it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
