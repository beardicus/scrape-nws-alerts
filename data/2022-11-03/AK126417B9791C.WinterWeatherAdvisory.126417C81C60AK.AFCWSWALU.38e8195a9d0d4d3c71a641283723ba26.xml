<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued November 03 at 10:07PM AKDT until November 04 at 6:00PM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM TO 6 PM AKDT
FRIDAY FROM THE SOUTHERN BRISTOL BAY COAST TO LAKE ILIAMNA...
* WHAT...Snow and blowing snow expected. Total snow accumulations
of up to two inches. Winds gusting as high as 60 mph.
Visibility as low as one half mile.
* WHERE...Port Heiden to Iliamna.
* WHEN...From 8 AM to 6 PM AKDT Friday.
* IMPACTS...Expect difficult travel conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A compact area of low pressure will move
quickly from the Kuskokwim Delta to interior Bristol Bay through
Friday. This system will produce bands of moderate to heavy snow
showers that will move along the Bristol Bay coast and Alaska
Peninsula, mainly in an area from Port Heiden to King Salmon and
Iliamna. Gusty northwesterly winds will accompany these bands
of snow showers, with the gusty winds persisting through early
Friday evening before winding down. Only minor accumulations are
expected; however, the combination of snowfall intensity and
gusty winds may reduce visibility at times to as low as one half
mile.</description>
