<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 315 PM MDT FOR
SOUTHWESTERN HUERFANO AND NORTHEASTERN COSTILLA COUNTIES...
At 242 PM MDT, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from Spring Burn Scar north of Highway 160 to Spring Burn
Scar south of Highway 160 in Huerfano county, moving northeast at 5
mph.
HAZARD...Intense bursts of heavy snow and gusty winds leading to
blowing snow and visibility rapidly falling to less than
one-quarter mile. Wind gusts up to 35 mph.
SOURCE...Radar and webcams.
IMPACT...Dangerous and life-threatening travel conditions are
expected to develop rapidly in the warning area.
The dangerous snow squall will impact portions of Highway 160 across
La Veta Pass and vicinity, and will remain well to the west of the
city of La Veta.
Locations impacted include...
Spring Burn Scar south of Highway 160 in Costilla county, Spring Burn
Scar north of Highway 160, Indian Creek on the southeastern Spring
Burn Scar, Spring Burn Scar south of Highway 160 in Huerfano county
and La Veta Pass.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

Visibility and traction are immediately lost in whiteout conditions,
making it difficult or impossible to slow down and avoid stopped
vehicles. Delay travel or safely exit the highway before the snow
squall arrives.</description>
