<description>...HEAVY RAIN WITH RISING STREAMS AND RIVERS THROUGH TOMORROW...
An Atmospheric River will produce moderate to heavy precipitation
across portions of northeast Oregon and southeast Washington
starting after 10pm PDT tonight and persisting through Friday night.
Heavy snow tonight will transition to moderate to heavy rain in the
northern Blue Mountains before 8am PDT Friday morning, with rain
rates diminishing Friday evening.
Total liquid precipitation amounts through 11pm PDT Friday ranging
from 0.50 to 1.25 inches are expected along the foothills, total
amounts ranging from 1.25 to 3.5 inches are expected in the
mountains with locally heavy amounts nearing 4 inches.
This will lead to rises on area rivers and streams, with nuisance to
minor flooding possible, especially along Mill Creek in Umatilla, OR
and Walla Walla, WA counties. Ponding of water in low-lying areas
and in areas of poor drainage can be expected.
Please monitor the latest river forecasts from the National Weather
Service for additional information.</description>
