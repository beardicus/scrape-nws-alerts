<headline>Blowing Dust Advisory issued July 26 at 4:00PM MST until July 26 at 10:00PM MST by NWS Tucson</headline>
<description>...EXCESSIVE HEAT WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM MST THIS
EVENING...
...BLOWING DUST ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO 10 PM
MST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Excessive Heat Warning, dangerously hot
conditions with heat index values up to 113. For the Blowing
Dust Advisory, visibility between one quarter mile and one mile
in blowing dust possible expected.
* WHERE...Western Pima County and Tohono O&amp;#039;odham Nation.
* WHEN...For the Excessive Heat Warning, until 10 PM MST this
evening. For the Blowing Dust Advisory, from 4 PM this
afternoon to 10 PM MST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Extreme heat and humidity will significantly increase
the potential for heat related illnesses, particularly for those
working or participating in outdoor activities. Thunderstorms
today will produce strong and gusty thunderstorm outflow winds
capable of producing dense blowing dust this afternoon into this
evening. Hazardous driving conditions due to a rapidly reduced
visibility in blowing dust is possible. These thunderstorm
outflow winds will likely suspend dust into the air that people
and animals breathe. Individuals with heart disease and
respiratory sensitivities may want to reduce their level of
exertion to limit the dust they breathe into their
lungs...especially if the are near dust-prone locations. Those
most at risk may feel better if they avoid outside exercise
today...keeping windows and doors closed to help reduce
exposure.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Motorists should not drive into an area of blowing dust.
Remember, Pull Aside, Stay Alive.
Keep in mind you may need to adjust your plans based on the
latest health and safety guidelines from CDC and your local
officials. Cooling shelters may need to take your temperature or
ask questions about how you are feeling.
Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</description>
