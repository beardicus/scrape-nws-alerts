- The rainfall from the showers and thunderstorms that have
been occurring over the eastern areas of South Florida the

4 inches with localized higher amounts are possible through
Thursday evening with the showers and thunderstorms. Any
additional heavy rainfall amounts over these areas could
cause flooding concerns. Therefore, a Flood Watch has been
issued for the these areas through Thursday evening.
