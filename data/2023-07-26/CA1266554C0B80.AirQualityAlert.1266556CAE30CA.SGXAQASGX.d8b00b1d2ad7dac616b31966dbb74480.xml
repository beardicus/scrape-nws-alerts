<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT FOR ELEVATED FINE PARTICULATE MATTER LEVELS DUE
TO WILDFIRE SMOKE...
The San Diego APCD has issued an air quality alert due to increased
fine particulate matter from wildfire smoke in the region, especially
the border region. The air quality alert is in effect starting Thursday.
If you smell smoke or see ash due to a wildfire, remain indoors with
windows and doors closed or seek alternative shelter, if feasible.
Avoid vigorous physical activity and run your air conditioner and/or
an air purifier. If possible, do not use whole house fans or swamp
coolers that bring in outside air. Avoid burning wood in your
fireplace or firepit and minimize sources of indoor air pollution
such as candles, incense, pan-frying, and grilling. If you must be
outdoors, keep the time brief and wear a tightly-fitted N-95 or P-
100 respirator to help reduce exposure. Limit the use of gasoline
powered lawn and garden equipment.
Exposure to particle pollution can cause serious health problems,
aggravate lung disease, cause asthma attacks and acute bronchitis,
and increase risk of respiratory infections. People with heart or
lung diseases should follow their doctor`s advice for dealing with
episodes of unhealthy air quality. Additionally, people with
respiratory or heart disease, older adults, and children are
particularly susceptible and should avoid prolonged exposure,
strenuous activities or heavy exertion as conditions dictate.
Levels of particulate matter can vary hour by hour and by location
depending on fire behavior and local weather conditions.

Diego County Air Pollution Control District website at
