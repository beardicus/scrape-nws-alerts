...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM SATURDAY TO

expected. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 4
to 8 feet on west facing beaches, highest near Point Conception.

* WHERE...Santa Barbara County Southwestern Coast and Santa
Barbara County Southeastern Coast.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 10 AM PST

AM PST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding of sea water is possible around the
time of high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such

NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
