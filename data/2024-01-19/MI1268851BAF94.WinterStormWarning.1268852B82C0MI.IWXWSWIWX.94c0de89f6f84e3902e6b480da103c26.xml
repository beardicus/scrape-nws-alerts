* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...System snow early this morning was
transitioning to bands of heavy lake effect snow. Intense
snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour will be possible within
dominant lake effect snow bands. Due to the nature of lake
effect snow, conditions can vary significantly over very short

the span of just a few miles. This can also result in highly
variable snowfall totals over short distances.</description>
