CST/ SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy lake effect snow. Additional snow accumulations of
3 to 8 inches. Snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour possible
with the heavier lake effect snow bands. Storm total snow
accumulations in excess of 30 inches across portions of northern
La Porte County. Whiteout conditions with near zero visibility
expected at times due to snow and potentially blowing snow.

Western St. Joseph IN Counties. In Michigan, Southern Berrien

* IMPACTS...Travel will be very difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Lake effect snow bands across southwest
Lower Michigan will shift back southwest overnight tonight
bringing additional moderate to heavy lake effect snow showers
late tonight into early Saturday. Due to the nature of lake
effect snow, conditions can vary significantly over very short
distances, going from just flurries to whiteout conditions over
the span of just a few miles. This can also result in highly
variable snowfall totals over short distances.</description>
