<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued January 19 at 8:39PM PST until January 20 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST SATURDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding
expected. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 6
to 9 feet on west facing beaches, with dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Ventura County Beaches.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 10 AM PST
Saturday. For the High Surf Advisory, until 10 PM PST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding of sea water is possible around the
time of high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such
as parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to
roads or structures is NOT expected. There is an increased risk
for ocean drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers and surfers
out to sea. Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people
off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...High tides near 6.0 feet are expected at
around 600 AM Sunday.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
