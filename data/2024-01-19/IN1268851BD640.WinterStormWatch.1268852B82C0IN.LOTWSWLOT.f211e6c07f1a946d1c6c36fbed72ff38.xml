<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 19 at 4:28AM EST until January 20 at 7:00AM EST by NWS Chicago</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST TODAY...
...WINTER STORM WATCH NOW IN EFFECT FROM THIS EVENING THROUGH
LATE TONIGHT...
* WHAT...For the Winter Storm Warning, locally very heavy lake
effect snow expected. Total snow accumulations in excess of 8
inches expected in northeastern Porter County with isolated
totals in excess of 12 inches possible in extreme northeast
Porter County. Snow totals will quickly diminish to the
southwest, with totals less than 1 inch across far southwest
Porter County. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph are expected near
the lake and up to 30 mph inland, leading to blowing and
drifting snow. For the Winter Storm Watch, very heavy lake
effect snow remains possible as it moves back into Porter County
tonight after a break this afternoon and early evening.
* WHERE...Porter County.
* WHEN...For the Winter Storm Warning, until noon CST today. For
the Winter Storm Watch, from this evening through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...For northeast Porter County, travel is expected to
become extremely dangerous, if not impossible in spots this
morning under the most intense lake effect band. Peak snowfall
rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour are likely. This, combined with
wind gusts to 40 mph, will lead to periods of whiteout
conditions. Unnecessary travel should be avoided over northeast
Porter County this morning.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Due to the nature of lake effect snow,
conditions can vary significantly over very short distances,
going from flurries to white out conditions over the span of
just a few miles. This can also result in highly variable
snowfall totals over short distances.</description>
