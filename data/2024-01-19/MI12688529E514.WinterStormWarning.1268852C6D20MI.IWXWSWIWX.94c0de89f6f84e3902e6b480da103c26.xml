<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 19 at 8:41PM EST until January 20 at 1:00PM EST by NWS NorthernIndiana</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM EST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy lake effect snow. Additional snow accumulations of
2 to 6 inches. Snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour expected
with the heavier lake effect snow bands. Near whiteout
conditions with less than one quarter of a mile visibility at
times with the heavier snow bands.
* WHERE...In Indiana, Eastern St. Joseph IN County. In Michigan,
Northern Berrien County. The heaviest additional snow
accumulations are expected across Berrien County.
* WHEN...Until 1 PM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Moderate to heavy lake effect snow will
continue this evening. A lull in the heavier lake effect snow
showers is possible overnight tonight into early Saturday.
However, additional moderate to heavy lake effect snow showers
are expected on Saturday. Due to the nature of lake effect
snow, conditions can vary significantly over very short
distances, going from just flurries to whiteout conditions over
the span of just a few miles. This can also result in highly
variable snowfall totals over short distances.</description>

your vehicle in case of an emergency.</instruction>
