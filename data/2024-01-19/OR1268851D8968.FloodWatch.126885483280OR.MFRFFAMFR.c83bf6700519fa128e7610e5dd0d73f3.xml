<headline>Flood Watch issued January 19 at 12:42PM PST until January 21 at 4:00PM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>.Heavy rainfall of 2 to 5 inches is expected tonight through
Saturday in south-central Siskiyou County below 5500 feet with heavy
snow above that elevation. Heavy rainfall combined with snowmelt
will allow streams to rise and bring a potential for small stream
and urban flooding.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY MORNING THROUGH
MONDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of southwest Oregon, including the following
area, Curry County Coast.
* WHEN...From Saturday morning through Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...Area creeks and streams are running high and could flood
with more heavy rain. Flooding may occur in poorly draining
low-lying areas and urban areas. Low-water crossings may be
flooded. As well as flooding concerns, this rainfall could also
lead to increased occurrences of rockfalls and land slides.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Excessive rainfall on already saturated soils, leading to
increased runoff into already high creeks, streams, and
rivers.
