<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM EST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy lake effect snow. Additional snow accumulations of
3 to 5 inches. Near whiteout conditions with less than a half
mile visibility expected at times.
* WHERE...In Indiana, Eastern St. Joseph IN County. In Michigan,
Northern Berrien County.
* WHEN...Until 1 PM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous
conditions could impact the evening commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The lake effect snow bands are expected to
meander across this area this evening and tonight lowering
totals some, but wherever it does lie, hazardous driving
conditions will be possible. Intense snowfall rates of 1 to 2
inches per hour will be possible within dominant lake effect
snow bands. Due to the nature of lake effect snow, conditions
can vary significantly over very short distances, going from
just flurries to whiteout conditions over the span of just a few
miles. This can also result in highly variable snowfall totals
over short distances.</description>
