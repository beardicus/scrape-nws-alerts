.A large to extra-large west-northwest 290-300 degrees) swell
will build down the island chain on Saturday and peak Saturday
night and early Sunday. Due to the westerly component of the
swell, leeward Big Island and portions of leeward Maui County
will be affected by the large swell.
...HIGH SURF WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM SATURDAY TO 6 PM HST
SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Along west facing shores of the Big Island, surf will
rise to 5 to 8 feet Saturday afternoon and peak at 10 to 15 feet
late Saturday night and Sunday.
* WHERE...Kona, Kohala and Big Island South.
* WHEN...From 6 PM Saturday to 6 PM HST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Very High...Expect ocean water surging and sweeping
across beaches, coastal benches, and lava flows creating the
potential for impacts to coastal properties and infrastructure,
including roadways. Powerful longshore and rip currents will be
present at most beaches. Large breaking waves and strong
currents may impact harbor entrances and channels causing
challenging boat handling.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Due to the significant westerly component
of this swell, shadowing could produce varying surf heights, and
west facing shores could experience more significant impacts.</description>
<instruction>Stay away from the shoreline along the affected coasts. Be
prepared for road closures. Postpone entering or leaving channels
affected by the high surf until the surf subsides.</instruction>
