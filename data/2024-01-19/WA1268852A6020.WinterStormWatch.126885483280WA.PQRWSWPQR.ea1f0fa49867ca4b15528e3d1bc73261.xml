<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
SUNDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Significant icing possible due to freezing rain. Total
ice accumulations of around one tenth to four tenths of an inch
possible. Winds could gust as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...In Oregon, Western Columbia River Gorge. In
Washington, Western Columbia River Gorge.
* WHEN...From Saturday afternoon through Sunday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Power outages and tree damage are likely due to the
ice. Travel will be difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Ice accumulation currently lingering on
trees, powerlines, untreated roads and untreated sidewalks will
not have a chance to melt prior to the onset of the next round
of freezing rain expected Saturday afternoon into Sunday
afternoon. As a result, any amount of additional ice
accumulation will further increase the risk of downed trees and
powerlines. Travel impacts will continue along portions of I-84
and SR14 as well.</description>
