* WHAT...Locally very heavy lake effect snow expected.
Additional snow accumulations tonight in excess of 6 inches
expected in parts of northern Porter County.
* WHERE...Porter County.
* WHEN...From 10 PM this evening to 6 AM CST Saturday.

expected to be very dangerous in spots tonight under the most
intense lake effect band. Peak snowfall rates in excess of 2
