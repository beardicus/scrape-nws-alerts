<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 19 at 12:58PM EST until January 20 at 7:00AM EST by NWS NorthernIndiana</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 AM EST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy lake effect snow. Additional snow accumulations of
3 to 5 inches. Near whiteout conditions with less than a half
mile visibility expected at times.
* WHERE...In Indiana, Eastern St. Joseph IN County. In Michigan,
Northern Berrien County.
* WHEN...Until 7 AM EST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the evening commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...System snow early this morning will be
transitioning to bands of heavy lake effect snow by this
afternoon. Intense snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour
will be possible within dominant lake effect snow bands. Due to
the nature of lake effect snow, conditions can vary
significantly over very short distances, going from just
flurries to whiteout conditions over the span of just a few
miles. This can also result in highly variable snowfall totals
over short distances.</description>
