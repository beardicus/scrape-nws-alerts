<description>...SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AGAIN TODAY AND TUESDAY...
* Numerous showers and thunderstorms are expected today with only
a slight decrease in coverage Tuesday. Storms will favor the
afternoon and evening hours.
* Storms will be capable of heavy rainfall, frequent lightning,
hail up to nickel size, and erratic wind gusts in excess of 40
mph. Outflow winds could kick up areas of blowing dust and
impact area highways including I-80 and Highway 50 east of Reno
and Carson City.
* If you have outdoor plans, be sure to have a way to seek shelter
within a sturdy building in case a thunderstorm forms nearby. If
you do not have access to a sturdy building, a hard-topped
vehicle with the windows rolled up is a good protective option
from lightning. If you are on a lake, winds may increase
suddenly from storms far away. The preferred time for outdoor
activities and travel will be in the morning prior to the
development of thunderstorms.</description>
