<description>...FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AKDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding is occurring.
* WHERE...Sagavanirktok River near Dalton Highway from Mileposts 401
to 407.
* WHEN...Until 600 PM AKDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Flood waters are eroding the Dalton Highway between
Milepost 401 and 407, with the road down to one lane. If
conditions worsen, the road may wash out and become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 330 PM AKDT Monday, the Sagavanirktok River continues to
flow overbank due to remnant ice in the main channel. This is
forcing the water to flow west and cause erosion along the
Dalton Highway from Milepost 401 to 407. These conditions are
expected to persist until ice in the main channel clears.
- Recent heavy rain and snowmelt in the Brooks Range continues
to cause high water on the Sagavanirktok River. Another round
of rain is expected Monday night through Wednesday with
additional rainfall totals of 0.75 inches in the headwaters.
This will result rising water levels on the Sagavanirktok
River through Thursday.
