<headline>Flood Watch issued June 12 at 1:38PM AKDT  by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM 10 PM AKDT THIS EVENING THROUGH
WEDNESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...Rivers draining the Brooks Range east of the Dalton
Highway.
* WHEN...From 10 PM AKDT this evening through Wednesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff from rainfall may result in minor
flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and
flood-prone locations. Water will cover gravel bars, increased
debris will be coming downriver, and erosion is likely along some
riverbanks.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Between 1 to 2 inches of rain is expected from Monday
afternoon through Wednesday across the Brooks Range east of
the Dalton Highway to the Alcan border. Runoff from this
rainfall will cause streams and rivers to rise rapidly to
bankfull and possibly overbank. This includes the Chandalar,
Sheenjek, and Colleen Rivers and their tributaries.
