<headline>Avalanche Warning issued February 09 at 9:55AM AKST  by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>The following message is transmitted at the request of the
Valdez Avalanche Center.
...THE VALDEZ AVALANCHE CENTER HAS ISSUED AN AVALANCHE WARNING...
* WHAT...Avalanche warning. The avalanche danger is high. Very
dangerous avalanche conditions exist.
* WHERE...For the mountains in and around Valdez and Thompson
Pass
* WHEN...In effect from Tue 10:00 PM AKST to Wed 10:00 PM AKST
* IMPACTS...Recent heavy snowfall and rain combined with strong
winds are stressing a weak snowpack and have created widespread
areas of unstable snow. Human triggered avalanches are very
likely and large natural avalanches are likely on slopes steeper
than 30 degrees. Debris from avalanches above may run into
valley bottoms.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS Another storm is forecasted to move into
our area Tuesday night through Wednesday bringing heavy
precipitation, rising temperatures and strong winds.
* PRECAUTIONARY / PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...Travel in or below
avalanche terrain is not recommended.

information.

education in the United States.

coverage area of this or any avalanche center.
