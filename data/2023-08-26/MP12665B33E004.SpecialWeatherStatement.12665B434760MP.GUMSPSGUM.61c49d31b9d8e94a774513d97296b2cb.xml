<headline>Special Weather Statement issued August 26 at 7:05PM ChST  by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>A developing tropical system, known as Invest 93W from the Joint
Typhoon Warning Center, is currently located west of Saipan. This
system continues to slowly get more organized. A southwesterly
monsoon flow is strengthening, with the strongest winds located
just south of Guam. As 93W continues to slowly strengthen over the
coming days and drifts northwest, the monsoon flow will lift
northward to encompass all of the Marianas, with sustained
southwesterly winds increasing.
Timing:   Through Wednesday evening
Location: All of the Mariana Islands
Rainfall: 4 to 8 inches with locally higher amounts possible
Land:     Sustained winds of 10 to 20 mph, with gusts to 25 mph
tonight will increase into the 15 to 25 mph range with
gusts to 35 mph developing in the Monday afternoon
through Tuesday night time frame, especially near
heavier showers and thunderstorm that develop.
Marine:   Sustained winds of 10 to 20 knots with gusts to 25 knots
tonight will increase into the 15 to 25 knot range with
gusts to 35 knots possible in the Monday through Tuesday
night time frame.
Seas of 7 to 10 feet for the Guam and Rota coastal waters
will spread north into Tinian`s and Saipan`s coastal
waters by Sunday afternoon. Seas will then peak Tuesday
into Wednesday in the 10 to 14 foot range, highest in the
western coastal waters.
Surf of 7 to 10 feet tonight will build into the 9 to 12
foot range for south and west facing reefs, possibly
reaching a peak of 13 feet.
Impacts:  Periods of urban or flash flooding possible. Minor coastal
beach erosion is also possible, with hazardous marine
conditions developing.</description>
