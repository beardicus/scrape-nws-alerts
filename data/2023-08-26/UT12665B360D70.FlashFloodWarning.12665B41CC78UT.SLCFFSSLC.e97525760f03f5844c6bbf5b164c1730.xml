<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING FOR THE EAST FORK BURN SCAR REMAINS IN EFFECT
UNTIL 630 PM MDT THIS EVENING FOR WEST CENTRAL DUCHESNE COUNTY...
At 532 PM MDT, Emergency management reported a debris flow over Rock
Creek Road below Upper Stillwater Reservoir. Doppler radar indicated
thunderstorms producing heavy rain over the East Fork Burn Scar.
Between 1 and 1.5 inches of rain have fallen. Rainfall has ended,
though runoff may still produce flash flooding.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through Petersons Gulch. This will affect Rock Creek Road
below Upper Stillwater Reservoir, including access to the
Yellowpine, Miners Gulch, and Rock Creek campgrounds. The debris
flow can consist of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms producing
flash flooding in and around the East Fork Burn Scar.
SOURCE...Emergency management reported.
IMPACT...Life threatening flash flooding of areas in and around
the East Fork Burn Scar.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
mainly rural areas of West Central Duchesne County
FLASH FLOOD...OBSERVED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>This is a life threatening situation. Heavy rainfall will cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks...streams...and
ditches in the East Fork Burn Scar. Severe debris flows can also be
anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may be washed away in
places. If you encounter flood waters...climb to safety.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry washes is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.</instruction>
