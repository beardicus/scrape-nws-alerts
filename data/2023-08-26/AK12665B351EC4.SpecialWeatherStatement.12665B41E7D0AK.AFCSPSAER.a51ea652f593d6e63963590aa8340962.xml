<description>...STRONG WINDS TO CONTINUE ACROSS THE ANCHORAGE BOWL AND KNIK
RIVER VALLEY THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING...
A strong autumn storm system over Southwest Alaska will continue
to produce gusty southeasterly winds through Turnagain Arm, the
Knik River Valley, and across the Anchorage Bowl Saturday morning
through Sunday morning. The strongest winds and gusts are expected
through late morning and again late this afternoon through late
Saturday evening.
For Turnagain Arm and the Anchorage Hillside, sustained winds
of 20 to 25 mph with wind gusts of 40 to 55 mph expected.
For the Anchorage Bowl, Eagle River, and the Knik River Valley,
sustained winds of 15 to 20 mph with winds gusts of 30 to 45 mph
are expected. The strongest wind gusts for these areas will
likely occur across South and West Anchorage, the S-curves of the
Glenn Highway near Eagle River, and from the Palmer Airport south
to the junction of the Parks and Glenn Highways.
People are urged to secure loose objects that could be blown
around or damaged by the wind. Prepare for the possibility of
power outages. Use caution if you must drive, especially if in a
high profile vehicle.
