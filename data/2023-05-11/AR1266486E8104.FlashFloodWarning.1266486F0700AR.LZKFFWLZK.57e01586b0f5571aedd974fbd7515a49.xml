<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued May 11 at 11:57AM CDT until May 11 at 3:00PM CDT by NWS Little Rock</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Little Rock has extended the
* Flash Flood Warning for...
A Dam Floodgate Release in...
Eastern Hot Spring County in southwestern Arkansas...
* Until 300 PM CDT.
* At 1157 AM CDT, dam operators reported the floodgates on the
Remmel Dam were expected to be opened which will result in flash
flooding downstream on the Ouachita River.
HAZARD...Flash flooding from a dam floodgate release.
SOURCE...Dam operator.
IMPACT...Flooding of areas along the river immediately
downstream of the dam.
* The nearest downstream town is Jones Mill, Friendship, Midway, and
Oak Grove.
The situation along the Ouachita River in Hot Spring County is
becoming more serious. Some residences in the flood plain may
become cut off due to low lying roads flooding. Livestock and
property should be moved out of the floodplain. Flooded roadways
should be avoided. Driving into flooded roadways is one of the top
weather related killers. Remember, turn around, don`t drown.
Initial impacts from the increased Remmel Dam releases will reach
the bridge on Interstate 30 near Malvern within 1 to 2 hours, with
maximum impacts occurring within the next 2 to 3 hours.
Initial impacts will reach Donaldson within the next 3 to 6 hours,
with the maximum impacts occurring within the next 6 to 8 hours.
Impacts will reach Friendship in about 10 to 12 hours.
This includes the following streams and drainages...
Blakely Creek, DeLisle Creek, Cove Creek, Prairie Bayou, Chatman
Creek, Stone Quarry Creek, Tupelo Creek, Tenmile Creek and
Ouachita River.
At 1158 AM, the current flow rate from the dam was 54000` cubic
feet per second.
FLASH FLOOD...OBSERVED</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
If you are in low lying areas below the Remmel Dam you should move
to higher ground immediately.</instruction>
