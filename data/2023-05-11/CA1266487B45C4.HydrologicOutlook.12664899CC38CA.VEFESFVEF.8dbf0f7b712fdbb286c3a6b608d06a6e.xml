<description>...Water levels will be rising on creeks and streams in Inyo County
this weekend through next week...
The next round of warmer temperatures will start to accelerate snow
melt along the eastern slopes of the southern Sierra this weekend
through next week. All creeks, streams and rivers will experience
higher flows that will likely continue through next week.
As creeks, streams and rivers swell there will be the risk of minor
flooding. All agencies have started taking steps to alleviate
flooding as much as possible by clearing debris from channels and
culverts, installing new and/or reinforcing existing infrastructure.
As a precaution, some roads and campgrounds have already been
closed. For your safety, obey all agency closures.
Additional, Inyo National Forest Service campgrounds will be at risk
of flooding. Roads used to access campgrounds and hiking trailheads
will also be at risk of flooding. Remember, never drive through
flooded roadways or around barricades. Pastureland or farmland
adjacent to creeks, streams and rivers could experience areas of
flooding, as well as a prolonged period of standing water.
For further information on Inyo National Forest Campgrounds go to:
fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd486882.pdf
Due to their swift currents and very cold water temperatures, creeks
and streams pose life-threatening dangers. Extra caution should be
exercised as exhaustion or unconsciousness from hypothermia could
set in quickly. Always wear a properly fitted life jacket for all
water activities.
