<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues to be possible.
* WHERE...Yukon River at Eagle.
* WHEN...Through Sunday morning.
* IMPACTS...Ice jam flooding is possible and has a high uncertainty.
Impacts could range between localized high water or severe
flooding. Large chunks of ice may push overbank. Now is the time
to take precautions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Breakup of the Yukon River between Dawson City and the Alcan
Border has been dynamic with ice jams forming and releasing.
This pattern is expected to continue downriver past Eagle as
the breakup front moves by the community.
A large ice jam downriver from Dawson City released at 6am
today but reformed approximately 20 miles upstream of the
Alcan Border. This jam is causing major flooding at the mouth
of the Fortymile River in the Yukon Territory. It is
estimated at least 12 structures are flooded with water 5 to
7 feet of water.
Water levels on the Yukon River have risen over 7 feet since
Monday at Eagle and are continuing to steadily increase with
intact ice still in place. When the ice jam upriver releases,
it is possible additional ice jams and flooding could occur
near Eagle.
The Yukon River is expected to breakup in Eagle in the next
few days.

<instruction>You should monitor local river conditions and prepare for the
possibility of ice jam flooding. Those living in areas prone to
flooding should be prepared to take action should flooding develop.
Now is the time to move items to higher ground.</instruction>
