<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EST
TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Heavy Snow changing to sleet with a bit of light freezing
drizzle possible across northwest Rhode Island and northern
Connecticut this afternoon as well. Snow accumulations of 4 to
7 inches and ice accumulations of a light glaze of ice in some
spots.
* WHERE...Portions of northern Connecticut, southeastern
Massachusetts and northern Rhode Island.
* WHEN...Until midnight EST tonight.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be very difficult this morning. 1 to 2
inch per hour snowfall rates will develop early this morning.
This will result in a very difficult morning commute. Snow will
change to sleet by mid to late morning with a bit of light
freezing rain/freezing drizzle possible across northwest Rhode
Island and Connecticut.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Improving conditions this afternoon
especially along the coast as temps rise above freezing and
precipitation becomes rather light. A second round of mainly
light snow may result in renewed slippery travel late this
afternoon and evening with the focus across southeast
Massachusetts and Rhode Island. A flash freeze is also expected
late this afternoon and early this evening along the coast as
above freezing temperatures fall back into the 20s.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.</instruction>
