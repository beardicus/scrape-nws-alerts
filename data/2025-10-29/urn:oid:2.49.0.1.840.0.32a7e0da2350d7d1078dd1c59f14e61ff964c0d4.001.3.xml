        <headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued October 29 at 10:48AM EDT until October 30 at 4:00AM EDT by NWS Baltimore MD/Washington DC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to one foot of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas due to tidal
flooding. For the Coastal Flood Warning, one to two feet of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas due to tidal
flooding.

* WHERE...Shoreline in Calvert County.

* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 4 PM this afternoon
to 4 AM EDT Thursday, especially around the time of high tide.
For the Coastal Flood Warning, from 4 AM to 4 PM EDT Thursday,
especially around the time of high tide. The highest tide levels
will be Thursday morning.

* IMPACTS...Through this evening, high tides around 3.5 feet are
expected, which results in several inches of water on Charles
Street and Williams Street in Solomons, and water reaching
backyards near 9th Street in North Beach. For Thursday morning,
high tides around 4.0 feet are expected. This floods portions of
7th, 8th, and 9th Streets in North Beach, with homes affected
near 9th Street. This may also result in flooding of structures
near Charles Street in Solomons; yards, parking lots, and
portions of both Charles Street and Williams Street will likely
be covered by more than a foot of water Thursday morning.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Tides two and a half to three feet above
normal, peaking Thursday morning. The next high tides at
Solomons Island are at 8:50 PM this evening and 9:07 AM Thursday
morning. The next high tides at Chesapeake Beach are at 10:35
PM this evening and 11:03 AM Thursday morning.
