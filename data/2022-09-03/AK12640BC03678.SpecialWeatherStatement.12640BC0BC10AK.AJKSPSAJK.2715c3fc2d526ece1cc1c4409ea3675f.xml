<description>...HIGH WATER ON GULF COAST AND ICY STRAIT CORRIDOR RIVERS
AND STREAMS...
The heavy rain from an atmospheric river moving through the
panhandle has moved off to the east of the area. Yakutat Airport
received over 8 inches of rain from  Wednesday night through
Saturday morning, while parts of the Icy Strait Corridor received
around 1 to 2 inches total.
The Situk River near Yakutat is currently still within its banks but
it is running much higher then its usual water level Saturday
morning. It crested at around 70.2 feet around 4 am this morning,
which is just below bankfull stage of 70.5 feet, and is on its way
down. Other rivers near Yakutat, are expected to remain within their
banks, but are still running higher then usual. Water levels are
expected to gradually recede through the weekend.
Areas around the Icy Strait Corridor only got around 2 inches of
rainfall total or less. Rivers are well within their banks Saturday
morning as a result, but some are running a little bit higher then
normal.  Recreators in and around areas rivers, especially along the
NE Gulf Coast, should monitor water levels through the holiday
weekend.</description>
