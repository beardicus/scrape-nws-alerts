<headline>Flood Watch issued September 03 at 9:36PM CDT until September 05 at 7:45AM CDT by NWS Midland-Odessa</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM CDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of southwest Texas, including the following
areas, Central Brewster County, Chinati Mountains, Chisos Basin,
Davis Mountains, Davis Mountains Foothills, Lower Brewster County,
Marfa Plateau, Pecos, Presidio Valley and Terrell.
* WHEN...Until 1 AM CDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water
crossings may be flooded. Area creeks and streams are running high
and could flood with more heavy rain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Multiple rounds of heavy rainfall the past several days have
produced saturated soils as well as elevated streams, creaks,
and rivers. Additional heavy rainfall today could exacerbate
ongoing flooding and flash flooding concerns, including along
the Rio Grande.

Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
