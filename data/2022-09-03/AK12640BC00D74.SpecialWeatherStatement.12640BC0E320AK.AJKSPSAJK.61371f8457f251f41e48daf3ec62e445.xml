<headline>Special Weather Statement issued September 03 at 8:53AM AKDT  by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...Northern Inner Channel rivers and streams rising to near bankfull
Saturday...
The heavy rain from the Atmospheric River moving through the
panhandle has past the Haines, Skagway and Juneau areas, but many
area rivers and streams are still rising rapidly Saturday morning.
Around 1 to 2 inches of rainfall was observed Friday night and early
Saturday.
The most significant impacts are expected along the Taiya River
where a flood advisory has been issued. The Chilkat River near
Haines and Klukwan is also rising but water levels are expected to
remain within its banks through Saturday afternoon. All other area
rivers and streams are running higher then usual due to the rainfall
from last night and will remain high through the weekend. Recreators
in and around area rivers and streams should monitor water levels
through the holiday weekend.</description>
