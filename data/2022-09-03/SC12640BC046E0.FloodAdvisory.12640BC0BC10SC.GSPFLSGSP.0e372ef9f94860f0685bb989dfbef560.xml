<headline>Flood Advisory issued September 03 at 2:00PM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM EDT THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall.
* WHERE...Portions of northeast Georgia and upstate South Carolina,
including the following counties, in northeast Georgia, Rabun. In
upstate South Carolina, Oconee.
* WHEN...Until 500 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Water over roadways. In addition, water from this
morning`s rainfall is still moving downstream through the lower
end of the Chattooga River, resulting in steadily rising stream
levels and faster than normal flows.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 149 PM EDT, county officials reported some roads in the
western part of Oconee County, particularly Westminster and
vicinity, remained under water due to this morning`s heavy
rainfall. Additionally, isolated heavy rain showers were
beginning to redevelop in and near the Advisory area early
this afternoon. While there is no immediate threat of
additional flooding, this could change later this afternoon
into the evening. Due to the saturated ground, it will take
little additional rainfall to produce new flooding.
