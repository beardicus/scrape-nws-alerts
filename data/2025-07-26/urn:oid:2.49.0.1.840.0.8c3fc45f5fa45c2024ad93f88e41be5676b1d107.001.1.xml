        <headline>Air Quality Alert issued July 26 at 4:10PM MDT by NWS Grand Junction CO</headline>
        <description>The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has
issued the following...

WHAT...Air Quality Health Advisory for Wildfire Smoke.

WHERE...Mesa County. Locations include, but are not limited to
Gateway and Grand Junction.

WHEN...900 AM Saturday July 26 to 900 AM Sunday July 27

IMPACTS...Smoke will continue to affect the advisory area on
Saturday and Sunday. Heavy smoke is expected in areas in close
proximity to the Turner Gulch Fire in southern Mesa County,
including Gateway and along Highway 141 in southern Mesa County.
Moderate smoke impacts are anticipated on Saturday morning in
other areas of Mesa County, however an increase in fire behavior
and smoke production from fires within Colorado and in other
states is expected to increase concentrations across the advisory
area starting Saturday afternoon, including in Grand Junction.

HEALTH INFORMATION...Public Health Recommendations: If smoke is
thick or becomes thick in your neighborhood you may want to remain
indoors. This is especially true for those with heart disease,
respiratory illnesses, the very young, and older adults. Consider
limiting outdoor activity when moderate to heavy smoke is present.
Consider relocating temporarily if smoke is present indoors and is
making you ill. If visibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in
your neighborhood, smoke has reached levels that are unhealthy.
