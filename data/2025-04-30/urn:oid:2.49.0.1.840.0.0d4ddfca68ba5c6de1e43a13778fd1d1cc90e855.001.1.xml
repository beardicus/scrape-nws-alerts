        <description>A large area of disturbed weather extends across western Micronesia,
associated with the Near-Equatorial Trough (NET) and embedded
disturbances. The disturbance the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)
and the National Weather Service (NWS) has been watching the last
few day is Invest 99W, a broad area of rotation just west-southwest
of Koror, Palau, located near 6N133E this afternoon. Today's
satellite scatterometer data does not show a well defined circulation
with 99W but this disturbance is associated with locally heavy
showers and thunderstorms, that are now more concentrated around
Palau and extending up toward Yap Proper, that could produce gusty
winds and choppy seas. The Joint Typhoon Warning center rates 99W as
a "sub-low" for development, which means significant development into
a tropical cyclone is unlikely over the next 24 hours. Farther east
in Yap State, JTWC has opened Invest 90W on a weak circulation near
4N144E, close to where the broad area of mid-level vorticity was
noted yesterday. Similar to 99W, this system is disorganized but
currently showers and thunderstorms around 90W cover a much larger
area compared to 99W, likely due to the support of the mid-level
vorticity in the area. JTWC also rates 90W's potential over the next
24 hours as "sub-low".

Model trends continue support one, possibly two, defined circulations
developing within the NET and shifting northwest through the end of
the week, with significant development not occurring until the
feature is northwest of Palau and Yap. The likely locations are
associated with Invest 99W and 90W. This slow and disorganized
development will lead to widespread variability in conditions across
Palau and Yap State, however the potential for locally heavy
showers, gusty winds and choppy seas still exists across the region.
As the feature shifts northwest of Palau and Yap, a monsoon-like
pattern may develop across Palau and western Yap state, potentially
leading to higher seas and surf along the westward sides of the
islands and impacting areas sensitive to southwest to westerly winds.
At this time, landslides are unlikely, due to the high variability
in rainfall potential. However, if soils become saturated by heavy
rain, this potential will increase with the onset of additional
rainfall.

Residents and mariners should monitor the latest forecasts for the
region at weather.gov/gum/PublicForecasts and any information shared
by WSO Palau and WSO Yap for their local regions.
