<description>...TROPICAL STORM BOLAVEN MOVING WEST-NORTHWEST TOWARDS THE MARIANAS...
.NEW INFORMATION...
None.
.AREAS AFFECTED...
This local statement provides important information and recommended
actions for people in Guam, Rota, Tinian, Saipan and the surrounding
coastal waters of the Marianas.
.Watches/Warnings...
A Typhoon watch is in effect for the following locations: Guam, Rota,
Tinian, Saipan, and the surrounding coastal waters of the Marianas.
A Typhoon Watch means that Typhoon conditions are possible within the
next 48 hours somewhere within the area.
.STORM INFORMATION...
At 1 PM ChST, the center of Tropical Storm Bolaven (15W) was located
near LATITUDE 9.6N...LONGITUDE 152.9E. This was about 610 miles east-
southeast of Guam. Storm motion was west-northwest. Storm intensity
was 40 mph.
.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
A Typhoon Watch is in effect. When making decisions, do not focus
on the exact forecast track. TS Bolaven (15W) continues to strengthen
over northern Chuuk State and is moving slowly west-northwest. It
is too early to provide exact wind and coastal inundation forecast
values for specific locations in the Marianas. A general concern
should be for the possibility of at least extensive damage somewhere
within the Mariana Islands.
.PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
For those under a watch, now is the time to begin preparing your
home or business according to your typhoon disaster plan. Listen for
possible warnings and be ready to evacuate if necessary. Heed the
advice of local officials and comply with any orders that are issued.
For interests at ports, docks and marinas, it is recommended that you
perform the prescribed preparations according to your emergency
operations plan for tropical cyclones. If you live on a boat, begin
to safely secure your craft and make plans to leave it for adequate
land based shelter. Listen for possible warnings.
Regarding the Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan coastal waters, small
craft should return to port or seek safe harbor.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for possible changes to the
forecast.
For additional precautionary and preparedness information, please
refer to the detailed recommendations relative to your location as
further described by your local emergency management agencies.
&amp;&amp;
.NEXT UPDATE...
The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather
Service in Tiyan, Guam around 9PM ChST, or sooner if conditions
warrant.
...TYPHOON WATCH IS IN EFFECT...
...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Stay calm and keep informed. If your home is vulnerable to high
winds, or you live in a low-lying area along the coast or any
location prone to flooding, evacuate to a designated shelter or
ride out the storm in the sturdy home of family or friends.
Some suggested items to bring to a shelter include a first aid kit,
medicines and prescriptions, baby food and diapers, games and books,
toiletries, a battery-powered radio, a cell phone, flashlights with
extra batteries, a blanket or sleeping bag for each person, personal
identification, copies of key papers such as insurance policies,
available cash and credit cards. Remember, pets are not allowed in
most public shelters, so check ahead with your intended shelter.
Regarding your home or business, cover all windows and doors with
shutters or plywood. Move patio furniture and other loose objects
indoors. Brace all exterior doors, including garage doors. Do this
as early as possible.
...TIMING AND PROBABILITY OF TROPICAL STORM/TYPHOON CONDITIONS...
The onset of tropical storm conditions could start as early as
Tuesday morning, with the onset of typhoon force conditions possibly
by Tuesday evening. The probability for tropical storm force wind
speed is 70 to 90 percent. The probability for typhoon force wind
speed is 20 to 30 percent for Guam, Tinian and Saipan. The
probability of typhoon force wind speed for Rota is 30 to 40 percent.

are possible by Tuesday evening. A general concern should be for the

forecast surf at around 14 to 18 feet along east and possibly south
facing reefs by Tuesday morning. Inundation of 2 to 4 feet is
possible.
