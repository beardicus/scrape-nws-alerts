<description>...TROPICAL STORM BOLAVEN MOVING WEST-NORTHWEST TOWARDS THE MARIANAS...
.NEW INFORMATION...
A Typhoon Watch has now been issued.
.AREAS AFFECTED...
This local statement provides important information and
recommended actions for people in Guam, Rota, Tinian, Saipan, and
the surrounding coastal waters of the Marianas.
.Watches/Warnings...
A Typhoon watch is in effect for the following locations: Guam,
Rota, Tinian, Saipan, and the surrounding coastal waters of the
Marianas.
A Typhoon Watch means that Typhoon conditions are possible within the
next 48 hours somewhere within the area.
.STORM INFORMATION...
At 7 AM ChST...the center of Tropical Storm Bolaven (15W) was
located near LATITUDE 10.0N...LONGITUDE 153.0E. This was about 600
miles east-southeast of Guam. Storm motion was west-northwest. Storm
intensity was 40 mph.
.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
A Typhoon Watch has now been issued. When making decisions, do not
focus on the exact forecast track. TS Bolaven (15W) continues to
strengthen over northern Chuuk State and is moving slowly west-
northwest. It is too early to provide exact wind and coastal
inundation forecast values for specific locations in the Marianas. A
general concern should be for the possibility of at least extensive
damage somewhere within the Mariana Islands.

The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather
Service in Tiyan, Guam around 3PM ChST, or sooner, if conditions

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Stay calm and keep informed. If your home is vulnerable to high
winds, or you live in a low-lying area along the coast or any
location prone to flooding, evacuate to a designated shelter or ride
out the storm in the sturdy home of family or friends.
Some suggested items to bring to a shelter include a first aid kit,
medicines and prescriptions, baby food and diapers, games and books,
toiletries, a battery-powered radio, a cell phone, flashflights with
extra batteries, a blanket or sleeping bag for each person, personal
identification, copies of key papers such as insurance policies,
available cash and credit cards. Remember, pets are not allowed in
most public shelters, so check ahead with your intended shelter.
Regarding your home and business, cover all windows and doors with
shutters or plywood. Move patio furniture and other loose objects
indoors. Brace all exterior doors, including garage doors. Do this as
early as possible.
...Probability of tropical storm/typhoon conditions...
The onset of tropical storm conditions could start as early as
Tuesday morning, with the onset of typhoon force conditions possibly

threat of sustained high winds is likely to increase. The latest
forecast is for tropical storm force winds to come in as early as
early Tuesday morning. Strong tropical storm or typhoon force winds
are possible late Tuesday evening until after midnight. A general
concern should be for the possibility of at least damaging winds
somewhere within this area.
