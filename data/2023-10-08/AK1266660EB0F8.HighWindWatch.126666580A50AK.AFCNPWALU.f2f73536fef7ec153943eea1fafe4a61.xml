<headline>High Wind Watch issued October 08 at 12:30PM AKDT until October 12 at 5:00PM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WATCH IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...South winds 45 to 60 mph with gusts up to 80 mph possible.
* WHERE...Central Aleutians.
* WHEN...From Wednesday afternoon through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...High winds could move loose debris, damage property,
and cause power outages. Travel could be difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Confidence continues to increase with
regard to a strong North Pacific low lifting northward into the
Western Bering Sea and pushing its front eastward through
Wednesday. Storm-force winds will accompany the front along with
hurricane-force gusts. The highest winds are expected to be
Wednesday afternoon through Thursday morning with southeasterly
winds shifting to the southwest through the event. Winds should
begin to slowly diminish Thursday afternoon and evening as the
storm weakens.</description>
<instruction>A high wind watch means there is potential for a hazardous high
wind event. Monitor the latest forecasts and warnings for updates
on this situation. Fasten loose objects or shelter objects in a
safe location prior to the onset of winds.</instruction>
