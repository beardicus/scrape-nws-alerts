        <headline>Coastal Flood Watch issued August 19 at 5:13PM EDT until August 22 at 11:00PM EDT by NWS Mount Holly NJ</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, life-threatening rip
currents. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to one half foot of
inundation above ground level expected in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways. For the High Surf Advisory,
large breaking waves of up to 8 feet expected in the surf zone
on Wednesday and 6 to 10 feet expected on Thursday. For the
Coastal Flood Watch, one to two feet of inundation above ground
level possible in low- lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways.

* WHERE...Delaware Beaches.

* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Thursday
evening. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 10 PM EDT this
evening. For the High Surf Advisory, from 6 AM Wednesday to 6
AM EDT Friday. For the Coastal Flood Watch, from Thursday
afternoon through Friday evening.

* IMPACTS...At this level, widespread roadway flooding occurs in
coastal and bayside communities and along inland tidal
waterways. Many roads become impassable. Some damage to
vulnerable structures may begin to occur. Dangerous swimming
and surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water.
</description>
        <instruction>A Coastal Flood Watch means that conditions favorable for
flooding are expected to develop.

Be prepared to begin taking appropriate action to protect life
and property. Follow the recommendations of local emergency
management officials. Be sure to check the latest forecast from
time to time in case a warning is issued or any new information
becomes available.

Visit the Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service at
water.weather.gov/ahps for additional water level and flood
impact information for your local tide gauge.

Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.

Always obey posted Beach Flags. If you enter the surf zone,
always have a floatation device with you and swim near a
lifeguard if possible. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float and do not swim against the current. If able, swim parallel
to the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the shore and call or
wave for help.</instruction>
