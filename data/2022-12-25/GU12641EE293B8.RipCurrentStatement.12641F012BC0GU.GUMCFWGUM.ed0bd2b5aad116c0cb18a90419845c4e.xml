<headline>Rip Current Statement issued December 25 at 5:50AM ChST until December 27 at 6:00AM ChST by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM CHST TUESDAY...
...HIGH RISK OF RIP CURRENTS THROUGH LATE MONDAY
NIGHT...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 7
to 10 feet expected in the surf zone. For the High Rip Current
Risk, dangerous rip currents expected.
* WHERE...North facing reefs of the Marianas.
* WHEN...From 6 AM Sunday to 6 AM ChST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...An approaching northwest swell is
expected to bring hazardous surf and a high rip current risk
to north facing reefs of the Marianas. Surf is expected to
remain just below hazardous levels for west facing, though
this could change if the swell turns more northwest or is a
bit higher than expected.</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
