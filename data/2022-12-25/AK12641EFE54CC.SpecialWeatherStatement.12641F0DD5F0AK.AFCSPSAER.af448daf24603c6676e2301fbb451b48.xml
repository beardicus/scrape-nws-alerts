<description>...GUSTY WINDS AND SNOW CHANGING TO RAIN ALONG AREAS OF THE
SEWARD HIGHWAY SUNDAY EVENING THROUGH MONDAY...
A frontal system will bring snow to areas of the eastern Kenai
Peninsula along the Seward Highway by Sunday evening, with
several inches of snow possible along the highway from Seward to
Portage Valley and Girdwood through late Sunday night. Gusty
easterly winds are then expected to develop overnight Sunday into
early Monday morning from Whittier to Portage Valley and Turnagain
Pass. These winds will usher in warmer air with temperatures
climbing above freezing by early Monday morning. Snow is expected
to mix with then changeover to rain by early Monday morning for
Seward, Portage Valley, and portions of the Seward Highway that
typically experience warmer temperatures. Rain on top of cold
roadway surfaces may lead to icy conditions and hazardous travel
conditions. Rain may also lead to water ponding on area roadways.
Motorists are urged to slow down and use caution when traveling.
Winds should diminish by Monday evening with temperatures
remaining steady. The mixed rain/snow is expected to linger into
Tuesday.
