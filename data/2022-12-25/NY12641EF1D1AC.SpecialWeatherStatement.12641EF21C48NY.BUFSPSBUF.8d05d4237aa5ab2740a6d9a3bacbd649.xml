<description>...A BAND OF HEAVY SNOW WILL AFFECT PARTS OF JEFFERSON AND LEWIS
COUNTIES...
HAZARDS...A band of heavy snow accompanied by winds of up to 40 MPH
will produce whiteout conditions which will reduce visibility to
less than a quarter of a mile. This band of heavy snow is producing
extremely heavy snow at the rate of 2 to 3 inches per hour. Travel
will be extremely difficult to impossible in this snow band. There
are also areas of blowing snow in and outside of this band.
LOCATION AND MOVEMENT...At 233 PM EST, the band of lake effect snow
was mostly across Southern Jefferson County and northern Lewis
County. The heavy snow band will remain nearly stationary or
move slowly south through 430 PM.
LOCATIONS IMPACTED INCLUDE...
Watertown, Fort Drum, Stony Point, Carthage, West Carthage, Adams,
Dexter, Glen Park, Herrings, Adams Center, Southwick Beach State
Park, Henderson Harbor, Barnes Corners, Denmark, New Bremen, Sackets
Harbor, Henderson, Black River, Smithville and Philadelphia.
This includes Interstate 81 between exits 39 and 48.
SAFETY INFO... Do not travel in this band of heavy snow. The
combination of heavy snow and drifting snow will make many roads
impassible.
