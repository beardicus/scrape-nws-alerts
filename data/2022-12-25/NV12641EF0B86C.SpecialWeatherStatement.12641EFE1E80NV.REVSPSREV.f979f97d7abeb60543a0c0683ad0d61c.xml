<description>...ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN RETURNS NEXT WEEK WITH STRONGER WINDS,
HEAVY MOUNTAIN SNOW AND VALLEY RAIN...
A series of storms next week will bring periods of strong and
potentially damaging winds, heavy mountain snow and valley rain
with potential for widespread travel and recreation impacts. The
strongest storm is forecast to impact eastern California and
western Nevada Monday night through Tuesday night.
* WINDS: The strongest winds are most likely from Monday night
through Tuesday morning. Widespread gusts of 45 to 60 mph will
be possible, with stronger gusts near 75 mph for wind prone
areas. Gusts well over 100 mph will occur over Sierra ridges.
See the High Wind Watch for details.
* SIERRA RAIN AND SNOW: The heaviest rain and snowfall rates are
expected late Monday night into Tuesday morning. Snow may begin
to accumulate on the main Sierra passes starting Tuesday
afternoon, and into the Lake Tahoe basin and higher elevation
roads of northeast California by Tuesday afternoon. Snow will
continue overnight into Wednesday with storm snowfall totals of
up to 2 feet possible above 8000 feet, and several inches to
over 1 foot possible between 5500 and 8000 feet.
* LOWER ELEVATION RAIN: The heaviest rain is most likely in
western Nevada valleys and foothills Tuesday morning and
afternoon. Rainfall totals could reach 1 inch in the main urban
areas of Reno-Sparks, Carson City and Minden, with up to 2
inches in foothill locations and lighter amounts farther east. A
mix of rain and snow will be possible by late Tuesday night in
foothill locations, with light snow accumulations near and
above 5500 feet including areas near Virginia City.
Later next week, more storm systems remain possible. The best
chances for more snow continue to favor the Sierra, but light
accumulations may occur in some western Nevada and eastern
California valleys. Ongoing travel impacts due to wind and snow
will be possible into the New Year`s holiday weekend.
Take advantage of the quiet, mild Christmas weekend to plan for
winter driving conditions and alternate travel options for next
week. Ensure that outdoor decorations are secured or removed
before the strong winds arrive late Monday night.</description>
