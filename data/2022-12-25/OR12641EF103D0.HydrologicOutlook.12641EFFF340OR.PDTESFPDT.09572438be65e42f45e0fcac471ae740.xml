<description>...MODERATE RAINALL TO BRING RISES ON STREAMS AND RIVERS THROUGH THE
MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK...
A storm will bring moderate to heavy rainfall beginning Monday and
continuing through Tuesday night.  Two to three inches of rain is
expected over the Cascades and one to two inches of rain is expected
over the Blue Mountains.  This rainfall, combined with warmer
temperatures will lead to higher snow levels and increased snowmelt
and runoff.
As a result, many stream and rivers will experience in-banks rises,
but at this time no flooding is anticipated.   However, if more
rainfall is received than expected, or temperatures are warmer,
there could be minor flooding of streams and low lying areas and
there could be some ponding of water on roadways.  While we know
that temperatures will be warmer than they have been and much warmer
than normal for the start of the week, confidence is below average
on exactly how warm they will get.
A second system is expected to move across the area Wednesday night
into Thursday.  However, cooler temperatures will bring lower snow
levels and should therefore allow for most of the precipitation that
falls in the mountains to be snow.  As a result, additional runoff
from this system is expected to be minimal at this time.</description>
