<description>...A BAND OF HEAVY SNOW WILL MAKE TRAVEL NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE IN
PARTS OF JEFFERSON AND LEWIS COUNTIES...
HAZARDS...A band of heavy snow accompanied by winds of up to 40 MPH
which can rapidly reduce visibility to less than a quarter of a mile.
This band of heavy snow is producing extremely heavy snow at the
rate of 2 inches per hour, with blowing snow reducing visibility to
near ZERO at times.
LOCATION AND MOVEMENT...At 422 PM EST, a wide band of heavy snow was
across much of Jefferson County and northern portions of Lewis
County. The band will remain nearly stationary, with just a slight
drift southward of 5 to 10 miles through this evening.
LOCATIONS IMPACTED INCLUDE...
Watertown, Fort Drum, Stony Point, Carthage, West Carthage, Adams,
Dexter, Glen Park, Herrings, Adams Center, Southwick Beach State
Park, Henderson Harbor, Barnes Corners, Denmark, New Bremen, Sackets
Harbor, Henderson, Black River, Smithville and Philadelphia.
This includes Interstate 81 between exits 39 and 48.
SAFETY INFO...
Do not travel in this band of heavy snow. The combination of heavy
snow and drifting snow will make many roads impassible, and travel
extremely dangerous.
