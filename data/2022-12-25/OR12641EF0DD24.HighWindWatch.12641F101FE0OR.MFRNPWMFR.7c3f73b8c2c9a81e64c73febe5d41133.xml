* WHAT...For the Dense Fog Advisory, visibility less than a quarter
of a mile in dense fog. For the High Wind Watch, south winds 25
to 35 mph with gusts up to 70 mph possible.
* WHERE...For the High Wind Watch, South Central Oregon Coast. For

* WHEN...For the Dense Fog Advisory, until 10 AM PST this
morning. For the High Wind Watch, from Monday evening through
Tuesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Damaging winds could blow down trees and power
lines. Widespread power outages are possible. Travel could be
difficult, especially for high profile vehicles. Hazardous

* View the hazard area in detail at
https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/map/?wfo=mfr</description>
<instruction>* Slow down and allow for plenty of room between you and other
vehicles.
* Fog makes objects appear farther away than they are
* Use low beams. High beams reflect back thick fog, making
visibility worse for you and other drivers.
* Be prepared. Keep your headlights clean. That way, you`re
ready for low-visibility conditions
* Don`t use cruise control. Most crashes occur because the
driver is going too fast for weather conditions.</instruction>
