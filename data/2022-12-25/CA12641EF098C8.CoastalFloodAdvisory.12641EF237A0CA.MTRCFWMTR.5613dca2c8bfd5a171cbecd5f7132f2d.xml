<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued December 25 at 3:38AM PST until December 25 at 2:00PM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>...KING TIDES WILL CAUSE MINOR COASTAL FLOODING FOR LOW LYING
AREAS THROUGH SUNDAY AFTERNOON...
.The highest astronomical tides of the year, commonly referred to
as the King Tides, continue to impact the coast and Bay shoreline
through Sunday and have historically resulted in the localized
flooding of specific low lying areas each year. In addition, the
lowest low tides of the event will be observed during the early
evening hours which may lead to trouble for mariners navigating
shallow waterways.
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 PM PST THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Minor coastal flooding expected at prone low lying
coastal locations across the San Francisco Bay shoreline during
peak high tide from late Sunday morning until early Sunday
afternoon.
* WHERE...Low lying areas of the coast including coves, narrow
beaches and sloughs, as well as along the San Francisco Bay
shoreline.
* WHEN...Until 2 PM PST this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of areas previously impacted by King Tide
events is expected, including low lying lots, parks, and roads
around the San Francisco Bay Shoreline with the highest high
tides. Difficulty navigating shallow bay waters during the
lowest low tides.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Tidal levels will also rise along the
Pacific coast but impacts will be more localized to areas such
as Elkhorn Slough near Moss Landing. Tide poolers and
beachgoers should be familiar with the times and heights of
local tidal levels to avoid hazards that may arise from
rapidly shifting water levels.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Tide poolers should also be aware that there could be occasional
waves running farther up the beach than normal. Do not turn your
back to the ocean.</instruction>
