<description>...CAUTION REGARDING HIGH WATER ON THE MENDENHALL RIVER...
Heavy rain over the past 48 hours alongside periodic rain showers
through the day has caused the Mendenhall River to rise to bankful
conditions, with the water level continuing to slowly rise.
Some debris from falling trees has been reported moving down river.
Use caution when rafting down the river. As of late afternoon, the
rate of rise is starting to slow and a crest just below minor flood
stage is likely late this evening. Therefore, no significant
flooding is expected, but we will update should conditions change.
For Mendenhall Lake:
At 4:15 pm the stage was 8.58 feet.
Flood Stage is 9.0 feet.
Forecast: A crest around 8.9 feet is expected around 11pm this
Sunday night.</description>
