<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued August 07 at 7:13PM MDT until August 07 at 9:45PM MDT by NWS Pueblo</headline>
<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 945 PM MDT THIS
EVENING FOR EAST CENTRAL SAGUACHE AND CENTRAL CUSTER COUNTIES...
At 713 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing heavy
rain continuing south and west of Westcliffe and Silver Cliff. Radar
estimates of 1 to 2 inches of rain has fallen within the past hour,
with flash flooding ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,
highways, streets and underpasses as well as other poor
drainage and low-lying areas.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Crestone, Crestone Peak, Silver Cliff, Westcliffe and Rosita.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.</instruction>
