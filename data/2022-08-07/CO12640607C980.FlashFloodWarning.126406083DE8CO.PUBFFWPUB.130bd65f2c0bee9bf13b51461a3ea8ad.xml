<description>The National Weather Service in Pueblo has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
The Spring Burn Scar in...
Northeastern Costilla County in south central Colorado...
Southwestern Huerfano County in southeastern Colorado...
* Until 530 PM MDT.
* At 232 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing
heavy rain over the Spring Burn Scar. The expected rainfall rate
is 1 to 2 inches in 1 hour. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected
to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through Pass Creek, Indian Creek, South Oak Creek, and Middle
Creek. The debris flow can consist of rock, mud, vegetation and
other loose materials.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms
producing flash flooding in and around the Spring Burn
Scar.
SOURCE...Radar.

the Spring Burn Scar.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Spring Burn Scar south of Highway 160 in Huerfano county, Spring
Burn Scar south of Highway 160 in Costilla county, Spring Burn
Scar north of Highway 160, Indian Creek on the southeastern Spring
Burn Scar and La Veta Pass.

Sulphur Springs on Indian Creek, County Road 421 near Indian Creek,
South Abeyta Creek near County Road 443, South Abeyta Creek near
County Road 442, South Abeyta Creek near County Road 441 and Pass
Creek Road.

<instruction>This is a life threatening situation. Heavy rainfall will cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks...streams...and
ditches in the Spring Burn Scar. Severe debris flows can also be
anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may be washed away in
places. If you encounter flood waters...climb to safety.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.</instruction>
