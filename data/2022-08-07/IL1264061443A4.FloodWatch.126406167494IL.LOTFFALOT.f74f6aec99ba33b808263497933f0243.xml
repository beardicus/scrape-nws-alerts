<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall on already wet
ground is possible as more heavy rain is likely within the region
tonight into Monday morning.
* WHERE...Portions of north central Illinois and northeast Illinois,
including the following areas, in north central Illinois, Boone,
De Kalb, Lee, Ogle and Winnebago. In northeast Illinois, McHenry.
* WHEN...Through Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of roadways that could cause impacts to the
Monday morning commute. Flooding along creeks and small streams.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rain will likely increase in coverage over at least parts of
northern Illinois into the overnight hours. There is high
uncertainty where specifically in the region this heavy
rainfall will occur and how much will fall, though there are
indications of near 2 inch hourly rainfall rates being likely
with any thunderstorms. This will create an increased flash
flood threat where the ground is already wet from
thunderstorms that occurred earlier today.

<instruction>A Flood Watch for flash flooding means rapid-onset flooding is
possible, but not yet certain, based upon the latest forecasts.
Flash flooding is a dangerous situation. Persons with interests
along area rivers, creeks, and other waterways should monitor the
latest forecasts and be prepared to take action should flooding
develop.
Stay away from flooded streams, ditches, stream banks, and fields.</instruction>
