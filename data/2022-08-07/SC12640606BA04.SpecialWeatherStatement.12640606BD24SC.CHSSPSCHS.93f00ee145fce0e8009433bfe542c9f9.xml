<description>...WATERSPOUT OFF THE COAST OF FOLLY BEACH and SULLIVANS ISLAND...
At 935 AM EDT...trained weather spotters reported a waterspout just
offshore of Folly Beach, driving west. Another waterspout may be
occurring near Sullivans Island. Both may drift onshore as a brief
tornado.
HAZARD...Waterspout.
SOURCE...Trained weather spotters.
IMPACT...There is a slight chance that the waterspout could move
onshore as a very brief tornado. Light objects such as lawn
furniture could become airborne if this occurs. Minor tree
damage is possible.
Some coastal locations that could be impacted include...
Mount Pleasant, Fort Sumter, Downtown Charleston, Isle Of Palms,
Folly Beach, Sullivan`s Island, Price Inlet and Capers Inlet.

be needed shortly if confidence in the waterspout moving onshore
increases. Be prepared to take quick action if the waterspout
approaches your location. Move to an interior room and away from
windows.</instruction>
