<description>...CAUTION REGARDING HIGH WATER ON THE MENDENHALL RIVER...
Heavy rain over the past 48 hours alongside periodic rain showers
through the day has caused the Mendenhall River to rise to bankful
conditions, with the water level having continued to rise through
the evening hours.
Some debris from falling trees has been reported moving down river.
Use caution when rafting down the river. As of late Sunday evening,
the
rate of rise has significantly slowed and a crest just below minor
flood stage is likely during the overnight hours on Sunday.
Therefore, no significant flooding is expected, but we will update
should conditions change.
For Mendenhall Lake :
At 5:00 pm the stage was 8.67 feet.
Flood Stage is 9.0 feet.
Forecast: A crest around 8.8 feet is expected around 11:00pm Sunday.</description>
