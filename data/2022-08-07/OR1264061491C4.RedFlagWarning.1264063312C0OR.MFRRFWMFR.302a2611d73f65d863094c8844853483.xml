<description>...RED FLAG WARNING NOW IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM MONDAY TO 9 PM PDT
TUESDAY FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR NORTHERN AND
EASTERN PORTIONS OF FIRE WEATHER ZONES 624...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
TUESDAY EVENING FOR STRONG GUSTY WIND WITH LOW RH FOR SOUTHWESTERN
PORTIONS OF FIRE WEATHER ZONE 624...
The National Weather Service in Medford has issued a Fire Weather
Watch...which is in effect from Tuesday afternoon through Tuesday
evening.
* Impacts: In southwestern zone 624, strong, gusty wind with low
relative humidity and critically dry vegetation will greatly
increase the spread potential of any new and existing fires. In
northern and eastern zone 624, Lightning and high fire danger
will likely result in new fire starts. Gusty thunderstorm
winds could contribute to fire spread. Despite rainfall, initial
attack resources could be overwhelmed and holdover fires are
possible.
* Affected area:
The Red Flag Warning for abundant lightning on dry fuels covers
northern and eastern portions of Fire Weather Zone 624, mainly east
and north of Chiloquin, including Chemult, Beatty, and Bly.
The Fire Weather Watch for gusty winds and low RH covers southwestern
Fire Weather Zone 624, including Keno, Worden, and Klamath Falls.
* Wind: South 10 to 15 mph with gusts up to 25 mph.
* Humidity: As low as 10 percent.
* Thunderstorms: Thunderstorm activity will likely begin by mid-
afternoon Monday with the most active period likely in the late
afternoon and evening. Activity could linger at night and into
Tuesday, shifting east and north with time. Storms will also
become wetter by Tuesday.
