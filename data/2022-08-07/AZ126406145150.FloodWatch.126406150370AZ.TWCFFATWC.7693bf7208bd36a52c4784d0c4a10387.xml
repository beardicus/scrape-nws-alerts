Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The combination of deep low-level moisture and an upper

will result in showers and thunderstorms producing very heavy

inches will be possible, with very heavy rainfall rates
likely. The heaviest rainfall will likely occur over the
Tohono O`odham Nation.
