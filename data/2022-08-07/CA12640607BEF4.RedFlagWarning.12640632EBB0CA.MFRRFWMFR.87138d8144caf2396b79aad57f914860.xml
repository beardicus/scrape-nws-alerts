extending northward to the SW corner of Lake County.
In South Central OR Fire Zones...624 east and north of Chiloquin
and Sprague River and all of 625.
* Wind: South 10 to 15 mph with gusts up to 25 mph, except outflow
wind gusts near thunderstorms could be 40 to 50 mph.
* Thunderstorms: Thunderstorm activity will likely begin by
mid-afternoon Monday with the most active period likely in the late
afternoon and evening. Activity could linger at night and into
