<headline>Special Weather Statement issued August 07 at 5:24PM EDT  by NWS Blacksburg</headline>
<description>...A strong thunderstorm will impact portions of
southwestern Bath County through 600 PM EDT...
At 515 PM EDT, Doppler radar was tracking a strong thunderstorm over
Hot Springs, moving east at 5 mph.
HAZARD...Winds in excess of 30 mph and pea size hail. Heavy rain.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around
unsecured objects. Minor damage to outdoor objects is
possible.  Heavy rain may wash debris onto the highway with
poor drainage flooding along driveways and culvert pipes.
Locations impacted include...
Hot Springs...
Warm Springs...
Lake Moomaw...
Ingalls Field...
Carloover...
Bacova Junction...
and Callison.
The storm is moving in a general direction that will take it over
Warm Springs Mountain near Highway 39.  Rainfall rates of near 3
inches an hour are possible with this storm, and will make it very
hard to see if you are driving.  Be prepared for water and or debris
on the highway if you are traveling over the mountain.
MAX HAIL SIZE...0.25 IN
MAX WIND GUST...30 MPH</description>
<instruction>If near Lake Moomaw, get away from the lake. Lightning may strike
tall objects such as boats or trees near the lake. Consider seeking
shelter inside a building or your vehicle.
Locally heavy rain will reduce visibility and result in ponding of
water on roadways, standing water in low lying areas, and minor
flooding of creeks, streams, and areas of poor drainage. Somewhat
urbanized areas, like Hot Springs, may experience street flooding.
Drivers are urged to slow down and use extra caution to avoid
hydroplaning.</instruction>
