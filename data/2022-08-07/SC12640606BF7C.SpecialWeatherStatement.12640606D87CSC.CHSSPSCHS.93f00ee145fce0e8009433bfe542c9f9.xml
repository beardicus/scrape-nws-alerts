<description>...WATERSPOUTS STILL BEING REPORTED NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE
CHARLESTON HARBOR...
At 949 AM EDT...the public and trained weather spotters continued to
report waterspouts near the entrance to the Charleston Harbor. These
waterspouts are very near the beaches at Folly Beach and Sullivans
Island.
HAZARD...Waterspout.
SOURCE...Trained weather spotters.
IMPACT...There is a slight chance that the waterspout could move
onshore as a very brief tornado. Light objects such as lawn
furniture could become airborne if this occurs. Minor tree
damage is possible.
Some coastal locations that could be impacted include...
Fort Sumter, James Island, Folly Beach, Sullivan`s Island, and Fort
Johnson.
WATERSPOUT...OBSERVED</description>
<instruction>Waterspouts that move onshore become tornadoes. A tornado warning may
be needed shortly if confidence in the waterspout moving onshore
increases. Be prepared to take quick action if the waterspout
approaches your location. Move to an interior room and away from
windows.</instruction>
