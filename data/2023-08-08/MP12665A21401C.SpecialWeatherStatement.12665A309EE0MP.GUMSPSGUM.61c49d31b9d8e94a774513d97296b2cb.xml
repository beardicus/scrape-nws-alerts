<description>...HEAVY RAIN AND GUSTY WINDS POSSIBLE LATE WEDNESDAY THROUGH THE
WEEKEND...
A tropical circulation, known as Invest 94W, continues to be
monitored by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and your
National Weather Service Forecast Office in Guam.
Based on visible satellite imagery and radar data, the center of
94W is located near 12.7N 143.9E, which is 65 miles southwest of
Merizo. It still looks like 94W will remain a poorly-organized
circulation as it gets absorbed into Tropical Depression Lan
(07W), which is located well to the north-northeast of the CNMI.
However, the numerical models also show a southwesterly monsoonal
flow will develop Wednesday evening into Thursday, with Guam
being on the northwestern edge of this stronger wind flow/moisture
surge. Then, as 94W gets absorbed into Lan, this monsoonal flow
will lift to the northwest to encompass all of the CNMI and Guam
for the Friday morning through Sunday time frame. Although it
won`t be raining all the time, locally heavy showers and
thunderstorms will occur from time to time. As these stronger
showers and/or thunderstorms develop, they may produce brief gusty
winds to 40 mph. In addition to lightning, seas and surf will
increase. A high rip risk may briefly develop. Mariners will see
winds and seas increasing, reduced visibilities, and a lightning
threat developing.
Location: Guam and the CNMI
When: Wednesday evening through Sunday for Guam
Friday morning through Sunday for the CNMI
Impacts: Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches, with
locally higher amounts possible.
Wind gusts to 40 mph over land, and gusts
of 30 to 35 knots over coastal waters.
Recommendations: Continue to monitor the forecasts.
Tie down any canopies and remove
any loose objects in case
stronger wind gusts occur.
