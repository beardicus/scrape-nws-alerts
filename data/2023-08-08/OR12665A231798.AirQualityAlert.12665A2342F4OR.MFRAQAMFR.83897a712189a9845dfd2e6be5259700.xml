<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE...
Oregon Department of Environmental Quality has issued an Air
Pollution Advisory...in effect until further notice.
The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality expects intermittent
smoke from wildfires burning in the region combined with forecasted
weather conditions. This will cause air quality levels to fluctuate
and could be at unhealthy levels, especially over the northern half
of Klamath and Lake Counties.
Smoke levels can change rapidly depending on the weather. People most
at risk include infants and young children, people with heart or
lung disease, older adults and pregnant people.
Members of sensitive groups may experience health effects. The
general public is not likely to be affected.
Protect yourself and family members when smoke levels are high.
- Stay inside if possible and keep windows and doors closed.
- Avoid strenuous activity.
- Use high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters.
- When air quality improves to moderate or healthy, open windows and
doors to air out homes and businesses.
- Cloth, dust and surgical masks do not protect you from harmful
particles in smoke. Use approved respirators.
