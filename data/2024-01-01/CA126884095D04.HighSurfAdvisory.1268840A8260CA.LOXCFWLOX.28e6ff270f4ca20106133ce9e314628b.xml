<headline>High Surf Advisory issued January 01 at 2:49AM PST until January 01 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST THIS
MORNING...
* WHAT...Surf of 4 to 7 feet will continue through this morning on
west facing beaches. Strong and dangerous rip currents will
continue. As surf and tide levels gradually diminish, the threat
of coastal flooding has diminished.
* WHERE...Ventura County Beaches.
* WHEN...Until 10 AM PST this morning.
* IMPACTS...Rip currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to
sea. Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off
beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Another round of high surf and dangerous
rip currents is expected to return to the Ventura coast
Wednesday through Thursday, when breakers of 8 to 12 feet will
be possible on west facing beaches.</description>
<instruction>Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
