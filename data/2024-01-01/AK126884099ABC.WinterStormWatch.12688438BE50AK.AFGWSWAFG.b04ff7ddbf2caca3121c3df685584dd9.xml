<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 01 at 3:07AM AKST until January 04 at 12:00PM AKST by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH THURSDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions possible. Total snow accumulations
of up to one inch possible. Winds could gust as high as 60 mph
creating possible whiteout conditions.
* WHERE...Dalton Highway Summits.
* WHEN...From Tuesday afternoon through Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Areas of blowing snow could significantly reduce
visibility in whiteout conditions. Expect areas of significant
drifting snowfall. The dangerously cold wind chills as low as
40 below zero could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as
little as 10 minutes.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Watch for blizzard conditions means there is a
potential for falling and/or blowing snow with strong winds and
extremely poor visibilities. This can lead to whiteout conditions
and make travel very difficult.</instruction>
