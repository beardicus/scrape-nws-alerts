<headline>High Surf Advisory issued January 01 at 7:36PM PST until January 04 at 3:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM TUESDAY TO 3 PM
PST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Large breaking waves of 10 to 15 feet, with local sets to
18 feet, and dangerous rip currents. Highest surf on west and
northwest facing beaches.
* WHERE...San Luis Obispo County Beaches and Santa Barbara
County Central Coast Beaches.
* WHEN...From 9 PM Tuesday to 3 PM PST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...There is an increased risk for ocean drowning. Rip
currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Large
breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and
rocks, and capsize small boats near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Minimal coastal flooding risk through
Thursday. Another round of high surf will be likely late Friday
into this weekend. With tide levels expected to increase to
around 6 feet this weekend, there will be the potential for
moderate advisory level coastal flooding near times of high
tide.</description>
<instruction>Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
