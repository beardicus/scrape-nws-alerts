<description>...SNOW SHOWERS WILL AFFECT SOUTHEASTERN GREENE...SOUTHWESTERN
FAYETTE AND NORTHEASTERN MONONGALIA COUNTIES...
At 429 PM EST, snow showers were located over Point Marion, or 7
miles north of Morgantown, moving east at 35 mph.
Winds in excess of 30 mph are possible with these snow showers.
Locations impacted include...
Morgantown, Westover, Star City, Point Marion, Granville, Brookhaven,
Fairchance, Smithfield, Bobtown, Greensboro, Osage, and Cheat Lake.
This includes the following highways...
Interstate 68 in West Virginia between mile markers 6 and 12.

Snow will lead to reduced visibilities and hazardous travel

snow shower. Rapid changes in visibility and potentially slick roads
are likely to lead to accidents. Consider delaying travel until the
squall passes your location.</description>
