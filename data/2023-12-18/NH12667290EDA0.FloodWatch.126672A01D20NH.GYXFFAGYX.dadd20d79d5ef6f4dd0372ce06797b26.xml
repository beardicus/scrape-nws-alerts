<headline>Flood Watch issued December 18 at 1:48AM EST until December 19 at 1:00AM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>.A potent and long-duration rain storm continues to bring moderate
to heavy rainfall across western Maine and New Hampshire through
Monday. Total rain amounts including what has already fallen within
the watch area are expected to fall between 2 and 4 inches with
localized amounts in excess of 4.5 inches possible in southern
facing mountain slopes. This will combine with snow melt across the
north and mountains, and with frozen grounds where snowpack is not
present, to create significant runoff and exacerbate flooding
threat. Minor to moderate flooding is possible along main stem
rivers as well as streams, many of which are still running high from
last week`s rainfall. Widespread low-land and poor drainage flooding
is also possible.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM 5 AM EST EARLY THIS MORNING THROUGH
LATE TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Maine, including the following areas, Central
Interior Cumberland and Interior York and central New Hampshire,
including the following area, Strafford.
* WHEN...From 5 AM EST early this morning through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Area creeks and streams are running high and could flood with more
heavy rain.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor the latest forecast and be alert for possible
Flood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be
prepared to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
