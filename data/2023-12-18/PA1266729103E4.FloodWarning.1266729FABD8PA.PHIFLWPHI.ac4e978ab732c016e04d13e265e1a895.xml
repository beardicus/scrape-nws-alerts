<instruction>Turn around...don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most
flood deaths occur in vehicles.
Stay tuned to further developments by listening to your local radio,
television, or NOAA Weather Radio for further information.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. Most flood related deaths
occur in automobiles. Do not attempt to cross water covered bridges,
dips, or low water crossings. Never try to cross a flowing stream,
even a small one, on foot. To escape rising water find another route
over higher ground.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov/phi.
The next statement will be issued this afternoon at 215 PM EST.</instruction>
