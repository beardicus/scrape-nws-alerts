<description>...WINTER WEATHER AND HIGH WIND ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM NOON
TODAY TO MIDNIGHT TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Snow and high wind expected. Total snow accumulation up
to 3 inches. Winds gusting as high as 45 to 50 mph.
* WHERE...Huron, Tuscola and Sanilac Counties.
* WHEN...From noon today to midnight tonight.
* IMPACTS... Expect bursts of lake effect snow showers and high
wind to produce hazardous conditions. Increasingly difficult
travel is expected during the event peak from mid afternoon
through mid evening. The high wind could also result in damage
to unsecured objects and localized power outages, especially
near the Saginaw Bay and Lake Huron shorelines.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS... A strong cold front will move through
Lower Michigan during the morning with a mix of rain and a few
heavier snow showers and wind gusts mainly in the 30 mph range.
Coverage of snow showers remains highly variable as a northwest
to north wind increases into the 40 mph range during early
afternoon. Lake effect snow then increases coverage and
intensity while peak wind gusts reach the 45 to 50 mph range
from about 2 PM to 10 PM this evening. Both lake effect snow and
wind diminish toward midnight and subside even further after
midnight tonight.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Take action to secure outdoor objects from the high wind gusts and
plan for extra travel time this afternoon and evening.
