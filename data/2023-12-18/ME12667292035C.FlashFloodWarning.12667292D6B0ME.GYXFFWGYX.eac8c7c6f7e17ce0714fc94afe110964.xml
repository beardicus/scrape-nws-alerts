<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued December 18 at 8:59AM EST until December 18 at 2:00PM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Gray has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
Rain and Snowmelt in...
Southeastern Somerset County in west central Maine...
* Until 200 PM EST.
* At 859 AM EST, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated
heavy rain falling across the warned area. Between 1 and 2 inches
of rain have fallen. Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches
are possible in the warned area. Flash flooding is expected to
begin shortly. Rapid snowmelt and frozen soils will contribute to
the runoff. The hilly terrain will favor fast flowing water which
will overwhelm small streams and culverts.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by heavy rain and snowmelt, with
rapid runoff over frozen ground.
SOURCE...Radar and automated gauges.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban
areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as
other poor drainage and low-lying areas.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Fairfield, Skowhegan, Pittsfield, Madison, Clinton, Kingfield,
Bingham, Carrabassett Valley, Norridgewock and Anson.
This includes the following Rec locations...
Pleasant Pond Mountain, Moxie Bald Mountain, Middle Carry Pond and
East Carry Pond.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR AND GAUGE INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
