<headline>Flood Watch issued December 18 at 11:20PM PST until December 20 at 7:00AM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE TUESDAY EVENING THROUGH LATE
THURSDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...All of Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, and San Luis
Obispo Counties in Southwest California.
* WHEN...From late Tuesday evening through late Thursday night.
* IMPACTS...Extensive roadway flooding, especially in low-lying
areas, and flooding of creeks and streams are possible. In
addition, there will be the risk for flash flooding and debris
flows in recent burn scars, especially the South Fire burn scar in
Ventura County. Also, there will be the strong potential for rock
and mudslide activity, especially on canyon and mountain roadways.
Flooding and rock/mudslide activity may lead to significant travel
delays and road closures. Increased flow in rivers and streams
will bring an increased threat for swiftwater rescues.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Periods of moderate to heavy rain and a chance of
thunderstorms are expected with the upcoming storm system.
Total rainfall estimates are 2 to 4 inches for most of the
forecast area, with 4 to 8 inches possible across south
facing foothills and coastal slopes. Rainfall rates of 0.30
to 0.60 inches per hour are expected to be common, with
isolated rates up to 1.00 inch per hour possible near
thunderstorms and favored south facing slopes.

Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop. Check latest road conditions
before departing.</instruction>
