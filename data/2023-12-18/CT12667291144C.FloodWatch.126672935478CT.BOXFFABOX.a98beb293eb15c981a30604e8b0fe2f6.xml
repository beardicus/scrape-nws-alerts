<headline>Flood Watch issued December 18 at 2:47AM EST until December 18 at 5:22PM EST by NWS Boston</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of northern Connecticut, including the following
areas, Hartford CT, Tolland CT and Windham CT, Massachusetts,
including the following areas, Central Middlesex MA, Eastern
Franklin MA, Eastern Hampden MA, Eastern Hampshire MA, Northern
Bristol MA, Northern Middlesex MA, Northern Worcester MA, Southern
Worcester MA, Western Franklin MA, Western Hampden MA, Western
Hampshire MA and Western Norfolk MA, and northern Rhode Island,
including the following areas, Eastern Kent RI, Northwest
Providence RI, Southeast Providence RI and Western Kent RI.
* WHEN...Through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Storm total rainfall of two to four inches will result in
rapid stream and small river rises. Areas of urban and poor
drainage street flooding are likely as well. Given similar
rain totals fell just a week ago, soils remain saturated and
rivers remain swollen, yielding the potential for renewed
flooding risks.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
