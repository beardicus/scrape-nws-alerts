<headline>Rip Current Statement issued December 18 at 3:49PM AST until December 19 at 6:00PM AST by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH TUESDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Life-threatening rip currents due to rough surf and
large breaking waves up to 9 feet and locally higher at times.
* WHERE...Beaches from Aguadilla eastward to Fajardo across
northern Puerto Rico, Culebra and St Croix.
* WHEN...Through Tuesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming conditions. Rip currents that can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water
where it becomes difficult to return to safety.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.</instruction>
