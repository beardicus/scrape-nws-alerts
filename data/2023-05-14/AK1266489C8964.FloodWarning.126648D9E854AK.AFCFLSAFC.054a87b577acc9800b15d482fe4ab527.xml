* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 943 AM AKDT, The River Watch Team reports an ice jam on
the Kuskokwim downstream of Crooked Creek, which is currently
causing flooding. As the ice jam moves downstream, additional
flooding is likely between Crooked Creek and Napaimute.
Impounding water due to the ice jam will cause rapid river
rises upstream of the jam.

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Move to higher ground now. Act quickly to protect your life.
Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
