<headline>Flood Warning issued May 14 at 10:29AM CDT until May 20 at 1:00PM CDT by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in the Twin Cities has issued a
Flood Warning for the following rivers in Minnesota...
Minnesota River at New Ulm affecting Nicollet, Brown and Blue
Earth Counties.
Minnesota River at Savage affecting Dakota, Hennepin, Scott and
Carver Counties.
Cannon River at Northfield affecting Rice and Dakota Counties.
...Forecast flooding changed from Moderate to Major severity and

increased in duration for the following rivers in Minnesota...
Cottonwood River Above Springfield affecting Brown County.
Minnesota River at Henderson MN19 affecting Le Sueur, Sibley and
Scott Counties.
Minnesota River at Mankato affecting Nicollet and Blue Earth
Counties.
.Heavy rainfall from Wednesday through Saturday night has resulted
in flooding along the Minnesota River and many of its tributaries,
especially from the Cottonwood River downstream to the Mississippi
River. Totals over the last 5 days have ranged from 3 to 7 plus
inches across much of south central and southwest Minnesota. This
has caused area rivers to rapidly rise. Crests should occur within
the next few days before a dry pattern this coming week allows for
rivers to decrease again.

* WHAT...Moderate flooding is occurring and major flooding is
forecast.
* WHERE...Cottonwood River at New Ulm.
* WHEN...Until early Saturday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...At 18.0 feet, Flood waters reach the back of the
campground at Flandrau SP
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 900 AM CDT Sunday, the stage was 15.1 feet.
- Recent Activity...The maximum river stage in the 24 hours
ending at 900 AM CDT Sunday was 15.1 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise to a crest of 17.5
feet tomorrow morning. It will then fall below flood stage
Friday evening.
- Flood stage is 11.0 feet.
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
17.5 feet on 03/04/2020.
