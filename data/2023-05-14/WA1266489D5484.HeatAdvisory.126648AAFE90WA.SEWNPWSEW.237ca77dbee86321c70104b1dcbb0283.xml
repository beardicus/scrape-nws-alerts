<headline>Heat Advisory issued May 14 at 4:45PM PDT until May 15 at 6:00AM PDT by NWS Seattle</headline>
<description>...HEAT ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM PDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Hot conditions with temperatures in the 80s to lower
90s. This will pose a moderate risk of heat-related illness.
* WHERE...North Coast and Central Coast.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM PDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Hot conditions will increase the risk of heat-
related illnesses for those who are sensitive to heat,
especially those without effective cooling or adequate
hydration.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Offshore winds will maintain very warm
temperatures this evening and overnight. A switch to onshore
winds Monday will bring a return of notably cooler conditions
and a low risk of heat-related illness.</description>
<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.
