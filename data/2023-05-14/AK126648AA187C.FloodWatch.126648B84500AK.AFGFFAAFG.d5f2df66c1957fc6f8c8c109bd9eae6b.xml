<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH TUESDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues to be possible.
* WHERE...Including the following area the Yukon River from the
Bridge upstream to Fort Yukon
* WHEN...Through Tuesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Ice jam flooding is expected at Fort Yukon between now
and tonight. Impacts could range between minor or major flooding.
Ice may also push overbank and move onshore along the river. The
possibility of ice jam flooding is expected to move downstream to
Beaver on Monday, and to Stevens Village and the Yukon River
Bridge on Monday night and Tuesday. If an ice jam forms, water
will rise very rapidly and people may need to evacuate to higher
ground at a moments notice. Prepare your community now for
flooding, and where possible, move items to higher ground.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Major ice jam flooding occurred at Circle on Saturday. The
high water and ice has now moved downstream and is passing
through Fort Yukon. When the run of ice and high water
reaches the in place ice downstream of Fort Yukon, it is
expected to form an ice jam and back water and ice up into Ft
Yukon and cause rapid river rises there between now and
tonight. The break up front and the possibility of ice jam
flooding is expected to move downstream to Beaver on Monday,
and to continue moving downstream to Stevens Village and the
Yukon River Bridge on Monday night and Tuesday. If an ice jam
forms, water will rise very rapidly and inundate low lying
areas near the river. Where possible, move items to higher
ground and prepare you community for possible flooding.
