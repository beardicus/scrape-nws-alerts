<headline>Flood Warning issued May 14 at 10:29AM CDT until further notice by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in the Twin Cities has issued a
Flood Warning for the following rivers in Minnesota...
Minnesota River at New Ulm affecting Nicollet, Brown and Blue
Earth Counties.
Minnesota River at Savage affecting Dakota, Hennepin, Scott and
Carver Counties.
Cannon River at Northfield affecting Rice and Dakota Counties.
...Forecast flooding changed from Moderate to Major severity and
increased in duration for the following rivers in Minnesota...
Cottonwood River at New Ulm affecting Brown County.
...Forecast flooding changed from Minor to Moderate severity and
increased in duration for the following rivers in Minnesota...
Cottonwood River Above Springfield affecting Brown County.
Minnesota River at Henderson MN19 affecting Le Sueur, Sibley and
Scott Counties.
Minnesota River at Mankato affecting Nicollet and Blue Earth
Counties.
.Heavy rainfall from Wednesday through Saturday night has resulted
in flooding along the Minnesota River and many of its tributaries,
especially from the Cottonwood River downstream to the Mississippi
River. Totals over the last 5 days have ranged from 3 to 7 plus
inches across much of south central and southwest Minnesota. This
has caused area rivers to rapidly rise. Crests should occur within
the next few days before a dry pattern this coming week allows for
rivers to decrease again.
...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT FROM THIS AFTERNOON UNTIL FURTHER
NOTICE...
* WHAT...Moderate flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Minnesota River at Henderson MN19.
* WHEN...From this afternoon until further notice.
* IMPACTS...At 737.0 feet, Highway 99 east of St Peter is closed
(estimated levels for spring flooding)
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 930 AM CDT Sunday, the stage was 731.5 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above flood stage
late this afternoon and continue rising to a crest of 738.2
feet Thursday evening.
- Flood stage is 732.0 feet.
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
738.2 feet on 04/10/1969.
