in flooding along the Minnesota River and many of its tributaries,
especially from the Cottonwood River downstream to the Mississippi
River. Totals over the last 5 days have ranged from 3 to 7 plus

has caused area rivers to rapidly rise. Crests should occur within
the next few days before a dry pattern this coming week allows for
rivers to decrease again.
