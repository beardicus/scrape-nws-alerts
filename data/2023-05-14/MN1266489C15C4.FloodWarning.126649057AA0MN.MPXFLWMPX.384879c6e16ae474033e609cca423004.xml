<headline>Flood Warning issued May 14 at 10:29AM CDT until May 21 at 1:00AM CDT by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in the Twin Cities has issued a
Flood Warning for the following rivers in Minnesota...
Minnesota River at New Ulm affecting Nicollet, Brown and Blue
Earth Counties.
Minnesota River at Savage affecting Dakota, Hennepin, Scott and
Carver Counties.
Cannon River at Northfield affecting Rice and Dakota Counties.
...Forecast flooding changed from Moderate to Major severity and
increased in duration for the following rivers in Minnesota...
Cottonwood River at New Ulm affecting Brown County.
...Forecast flooding changed from Minor to Moderate severity and
increased in duration for the following rivers in Minnesota...
Cottonwood River Above Springfield affecting Brown County.
Minnesota River at Henderson MN19 affecting Le Sueur, Sibley and
Scott Counties.
Minnesota River at Mankato affecting Nicollet and Blue Earth
Counties.
.Heavy rainfall from Wednesday through Saturday night has resulted
in flooding along the Minnesota River and many of its tributaries,
especially from the Cottonwood River downstream to the Mississippi
River. Totals over the last 5 days have ranged from 3 to 7 plus
inches across much of south central and southwest Minnesota. This
has caused area rivers to rapidly rise. Crests should occur within
the next few days before a dry pattern this coming week allows for
rivers to decrease again.
...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT TO EARLY SUNDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Moderate flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Minnesota River at Mankato.
* WHEN...From late tonight to early Sunday morning.
* IMPACTS...At 26.6 feet, Flood waters begin to impact Highway 169
in North Mankato.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 930 AM CDT Sunday, the stage was 19.8 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above flood stage
just after midnight tonight to a crest of 26.2 feet Wednesday
morning. It will then fall below flood stage Saturday
morning.
- Flood stage is 22.0 feet.
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
26.2 feet on 04/09/1951.
