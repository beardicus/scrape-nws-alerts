<headline>Flood Warning issued May 14 at 10:29AM CDT until further notice by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in
Minnesota...
Minnesota River near Jordan affecting Sibley, Scott and Carver
Counties.
Redwood River near Redwood Falls affecting Redwood County.
...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in
Minnesota...
Minnesota River at Morton affecting Redwood and Renville Counties.
Minnesota River at Montevideo affecting Lac qui Parle, Chippewa
and Yellow Medicine Counties.
.Heavy rainfall from Wednesday through Saturday night has resulted
in flooding along the Minnesota River and many of its tributaries,
especially from the Cottonwood River downstream to the Mississippi
River. Totals over the last 5 days have ranged from 3 to 7 plus
inches across much of south central and southwest Minnesota. This
has caused area rivers to rapidly rise. Crests should occur within
the next few days before a dry pattern this coming week allows for
rivers to decrease again.
...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY EVENING UNTIL FURTHER
NOTICE...
* WHAT...Moderate flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Minnesota River near Jordan.
* WHEN...From Monday evening until further notice.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 945 AM CDT Sunday, the stage was 22.0 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above flood stage
late tomorrow evening and continue rising to a crest of 31.6
feet Saturday morning.
- Flood stage is 25.0 feet.
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
31.7 feet on 03/23/2010.
