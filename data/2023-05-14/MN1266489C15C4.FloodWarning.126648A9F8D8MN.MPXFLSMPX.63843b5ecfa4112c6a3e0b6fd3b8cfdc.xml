<headline>Flood Warning issued May 14 at 10:29AM CDT until further notice by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in
Minnesota...

Counties.

...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in
Minnesota...
Minnesota River at Morton affecting Redwood and Renville Counties.
Minnesota River at Montevideo affecting Lac qui Parle, Chippewa
and Yellow Medicine Counties.
.Heavy rainfall from Wednesday through Saturday night has resulted
in flooding along the Minnesota River and many of its tributaries,
especially from the Cottonwood River downstream to the Mississippi
River. Totals over the last 5 days have ranged from 3 to 7 plus
inches across much of south central and southwest Minnesota. This
has caused area rivers to rapidly rise. Crests should occur within
the next few days before a dry pattern this coming week allows for
rivers to decrease again.

* WHAT...Minor flooding is occurring and moderate flooding is
forecast.
* WHERE...Minnesota River at Morton.
* WHEN...Until further notice.
* IMPACTS...At 23.0 feet, Riverside Rd and Front Street flooded in

- At 900 AM CDT Sunday, the stage was 22.4 feet.
- Recent Activity...The maximum river stage in the 24 hours
ending at 900 AM CDT Sunday was 22.4 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise to a crest of 23.4
feet Tuesday morning.
