- At 330 PM AKDT, the Riverwatch team reports and gage data
confirms flood waters are receding in Crooked Creek. The ice
jam continues to progress downstream. According to estimates
from the team, water should begin to rise at Napaimute by
Sunday evening. Impounding water due to the ice jam will
cause rapid river rises upstream of the jam.

<instruction>Move to higher ground now. Act quickly to protect your life.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
