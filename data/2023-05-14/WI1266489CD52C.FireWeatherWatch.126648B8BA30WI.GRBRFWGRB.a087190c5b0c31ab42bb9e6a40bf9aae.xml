<description>...Fire Weather Watch for northern Wisconsin Monday...
.Dry conditions will combine with warmer temperatures on Monday
and result in low relative humidity values across northern
Wisconsin. Although winds will be relatively light from the west,
critical fire weather conditions are possible. A Red Flag Warning
may be needed.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY MORNING THROUGH
MONDAY EVENING FOR POSSIBLE CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS FOR
NORTHERN WISCONSIN...
The National Weather Service in Green Bay has issued a Fire
Weather Watch for possible critical fire weather conditions,
which is in effect from Monday morning through Monday evening.
* AFFECTED AREA...Florence.
* TIMING...From Monday morning through Monday evening.
* WINDS...West 5 to 10 mph.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...As low as 14 to 20 percent.
* TEMPERATURES...In the middle to upper 70s.
* IMPACTS...Fires will start easily and spread quickly in these
conditions. So outdoor burning should not be attempted. Visit
the Wisconsin DNR website at
apps.dnr.wi.gov/wisburn/#/BurnRestrictions and click on the
appropriate county to view current burning restrictions.</description>
<instruction>A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
may occur. A combination of strong winds, very low relative
humidity, warm temperatures, and exceptionally dry fuels may
create dangerous wildland fire conditions. Firefighters,
emergency management, and law enforcement should monitor
forecasts for updates on this potentially dangerous wildland fire
situation.</instruction>
