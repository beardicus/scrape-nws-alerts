<headline>Flood Warning issued May 14 at 10:29AM CDT until May 19 at 4:00AM CDT by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in the Twin Cities has issued a
Flood Warning for the following rivers in Minnesota...
Minnesota River at New Ulm affecting Nicollet, Brown and Blue
Earth Counties.
Minnesota River at Savage affecting Dakota, Hennepin, Scott and
Carver Counties.
Cannon River at Northfield affecting Rice and Dakota Counties.
...Forecast flooding changed from Moderate to Major severity and
increased in duration for the following rivers in Minnesota...
Cottonwood River at New Ulm affecting Brown County.
...Forecast flooding changed from Minor to Moderate severity and
increased in duration for the following rivers in Minnesota...
Cottonwood River Above Springfield affecting Brown County.
Minnesota River at Henderson MN19 affecting Le Sueur, Sibley and
Scott Counties.
Minnesota River at Mankato affecting Nicollet and Blue Earth
Counties.
.Heavy rainfall from Wednesday through Saturday night has resulted
in flooding along the Minnesota River and many of its tributaries,
especially from the Cottonwood River downstream to the Mississippi
River. Totals over the last 5 days have ranged from 3 to 7 plus
inches across much of south central and southwest Minnesota. This
has caused area rivers to rapidly rise. Crests should occur within
the next few days before a dry pattern this coming week allows for
rivers to decrease again.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY EVENING TO EARLY FRIDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Minnesota River at New Ulm.
* WHEN...From Monday evening to early Friday morning.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 945 AM CDT Sunday, the stage was 798.8 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above flood stage
tomorrow evening to a crest of 800.2 feet Tuesday evening. It
will then fall below flood stage late Thursday morning.
- Flood stage is 800.0 feet.
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
800.2 feet on 07/04/2019.
