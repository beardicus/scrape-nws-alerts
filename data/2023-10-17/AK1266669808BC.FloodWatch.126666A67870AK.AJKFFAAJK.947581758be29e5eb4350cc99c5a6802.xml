<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...The following areas, Prince of Wales and Southern Inner
Channels. This includes the cities of Craig, Klawock, Hydaburg,
Coffman Cove, Thorne Bay, Ketchikan, And Metlakatla.
* WHEN...From late tonight through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, other low-lying areas and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A surge of moisture continues to move into the southern
panhandle with  a prolonged period of rainfall. Heaviest
rainfall is expected Tuesday afternoon through Wednesday
afternoon before rainfall diminishes. Rainfall amounts of
three to five inches with higher amounts at higher elevations
are likely. This will cause area streams and rivers to rise.
The highest likelihood of any flooding will be for
smaller/flashier streams and basins.
This is a evolving and changing situation. Stay tuned to the
National Weather Service for updates at weather.gov/Juneau
and on social media.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.
Stay tuned to further developments by listening to your local radio,
television, or NOAA Weather Radio for further information.</instruction>
