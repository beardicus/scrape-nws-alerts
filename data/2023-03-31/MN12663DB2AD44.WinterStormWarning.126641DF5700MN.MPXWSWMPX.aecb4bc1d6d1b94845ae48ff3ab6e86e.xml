<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 31 at 3:41AM CDT until April 01 at 7:00AM CDT by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...BLIZZARD CONDITIONS LIKELY OVER SOUTHWESTERN MINNESOTA THIS
AFTERNOON THROUGH TONIGHT...
...AREAS OF FREEZING RAIN THIS MORNING WITH WIDESPREAD WINTRY
PRECIPITATION THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH TONIGHT WITH SNOW RATES OF 1
TO 2 INCHES PER HOUR POSSIBLE...
.A complex storm system developing over the Rockies will shift
east into the Central Plains tonight then gradually move into the
Great Lakes Friday night. Precipitation will continue this morning
as rain or freezing rain, depending on surface temperatures. A
light icing to a tenth of an inch of ice accretion is likely
mainly north of a line from Redwood Falls to Buffalo MN to Rice
Lake WI. The precipitation will then gradually change over to snow
this afternoon through tonight, which could be heavy at times.
Snowfall amounts should range from 5 to 8 inches in a swath from
the Madison and Canby MN areas eastward through the Twin Cities
metro and continuing through most of western Wisconsin, with
locally higher totals possible. 2 to 4 inches are expected from
the St Cloud area northward and from the Mankato area southward.
In addition, strong winds will develop late this morning which
will persist through Friday night. Blizzard conditions are likely
west of a line from Benson to Hector to New Ulm to Madelia. Near
blizzard conditions are possible eastward to the Interstate 35
corridor.
A Winter Weather Advisory is in place for much of western and
central Minnesota into northwest Wisconsin for freezing rain
tonight into early Friday. A Blizzard Warning is in place for
portions of southwestern Minnesota. A Winter Storm Warning
remains in place to the east of the Blizzard Warning for central,
eastern and southern Minnesota through western Wisconsin. For
those counties not currently in a Blizzard Warning, conditions
will be close to blizzard conditions and warnings may still be
issued even with lighter snow accumulations.
