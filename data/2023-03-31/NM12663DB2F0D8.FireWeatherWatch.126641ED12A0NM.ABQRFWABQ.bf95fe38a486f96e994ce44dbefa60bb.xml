<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued March 31 at 4:14AM MDT until April 01 at 8:00PM MDT by NWS Albuquerque</headline>
<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM TO 8 PM TODAY FOR THE
NORTHEAST AND CENTRAL HIGHLANDS AS WELL AS THE NORTHEAST AND EAST
CENTRAL PLAINS DUE TO STRONG WINDS, LOW HUMIDITY AND AN UNSTABLE
ATMOSPHERE...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT SATURDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH EARLY
EVENING FOR THE NORTHEAST HIGHLANDS AND PLAINS DUE TO STRONG
WINDS, LOW HUMIDITY AND AN UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
.Widespread critical fire weather conditions are expected late
this morning through early evening from the northeast and central
highlands to the Oklahoma and Texas borders. The strongest winds
are likely during the early afternoon hours. Even though readings
will be cooler today compared to Thursday, minimum humidities are
expected to drop into the 8-15 percent range. Saturday will be a
quieter day for much of New Mexico. The exception will be across
the northeast plains where single digit humidities should combine
with gusty winds, although not as strong as today. There could be
a risk for critical fire weather conditions over the east central
plains, but confidence in coverage and duration is still unclear.
