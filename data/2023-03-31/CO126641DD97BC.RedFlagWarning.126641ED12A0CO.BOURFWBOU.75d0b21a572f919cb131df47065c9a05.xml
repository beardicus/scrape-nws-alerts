<headline>Red Flag Warning issued March 31 at 6:55PM MDT until April 01 at 8:00PM MDT by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS EXPECTED AGAIN ON SATURDAY...
Very strong and gusty west to northwest winds that we observed
today will gradually diminish early this evening. However, only
moderate humidity recovery will occur overnight.
On Saturday, we`ll turn warmer which means somewhat lower humidity
readings. Fortunately winds will be lighter, but at the same time
still reach Red Flag Criteria over the southern portions of our
forecast area from Park County eastward across the Palmer Divide.
Winds gusting to 25 to 30 mph will coincide with minimum humidity
values of 10 to 16 percent.
Sunday will feature increasing winds and even warmer temperatures,
so more widespread critical fire weather conditions can be expected
then. Monday should finally start a cooldown, but southern portions
around Park County and adjacent areas toward the Palmer Divide
could still stay windy and warm.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM TO 8 PM MDT
SATURDAY FOR WIND AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR SOUTH PARK...FIRE
