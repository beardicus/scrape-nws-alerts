<headline>Red Flag Warning issued March 31 at 2:51PM MDT until April 01 at 8:00PM MDT by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>...REPEATED DAYS OF CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS...
Very strong and gusty west to northwest winds that we observed
today will gradually diminish early this evening. However, only
moderate humidity recovery will occur overnight.
On Saturday, we`ll turn warmer which means somewhat lower
humidity readings. Fortunately winds will be lighter, but at the
same time still reach Red Flag Criteria over the southern portions
of our forecast area from Park County eastward across the Palmer
Divide. Winds gusting to 25 to 30 mph will coincide with minimum
humidity values of 10 to 16 percent.
Sunday will feature increasing winds and even warmer temperatures,
so more widespread critical fire weather conditions can be
expected then. Monday should finally start a cooldown, but
southern portions around Park County and adjacent areas toward the
Palmer Divide could still stay windy and warm.

FOR WIND AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR SOUTH PARK...FIRE WEATHER
