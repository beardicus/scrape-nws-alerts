<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued March 31 at 3:33AM CDT until April 01 at 10:00AM CDT by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Strong Spring Storm to Bring Heavy Snow and Strong Winds to
the Region...
.A potent storm system brings a variety of impactful weather to
the region into Saturday morning. Early morning calls to Taylor
County did not reveal any issues, however with temperatures
hovering around freezing, will keep the winter weather advisory in
place for potential travel impacts on untreated, cold surfaces.
Tonight, widespread rain transitions to snow. The snow will be
heavy at times, especially along and north of Interstate 90 and
94 where 1 to 2&quot; per hour rates are expected. Currently, the
higher amounts from 6 to 89 inches are favored north of Highway
10 in north-central Wisconsin. Moving south toward Interstate 90,
2 to 6 inch accumulations are expected. The heavier snow may try
to push farther south, and there is uncertainty in how quickly
rain transitions to snow. Continue to monitor the forecast for
updates
In addition northwest winds will increase Friday night, gusting
from 35 to 45 mph. Visibilities will be further reduced in the
falling snow, with some drifting mostly in open areas.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM TO 10 AM CDT
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 3
inches. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.
