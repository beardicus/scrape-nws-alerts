<description>...Strong Spring Storm to Bring Heavy Snow and Strong Winds to
the Region...
.A potent storm system brings a variety of impactful weather to
the region into Saturday morning. Early morning calls to Taylor
County did not reveal any issues, however with temperatures
hovering around freezing, will keep the winter weather advisory
in place for potential travel impacts on untreated, cold
surfaces.
Tonight, widespread rain transitions to snow. The snow will be
heavy at times, especially along and north of Interstate 90 and
94 where 1 to 2&quot; per hour rates are expected. Currently, the
higher amounts from 6 to 9 inches are favored north of Highway 10
in north-central Wisconsin. Moving south toward Interstate 90, 2
to 6 inch accumulations are expected. The heavier snow may try to
push farther south, and there is uncertainty in how quickly rain
transitions to snow. Continue to monitor the forecast for updates
In addition northwest winds will increase Friday night, gusting
from 35 to 45 mph. Visibilities will be further reduced in the
falling snow, with some drifting mostly in open areas.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM TO 10 AM CDT
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 3 to 6
inches. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Clark and Jackson Counties.
* WHEN...From 1 AM to 10 AM CDT Saturday.

snow could significantly reduce visibility.</description>
