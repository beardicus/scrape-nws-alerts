<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued March 31 at 3:33AM CDT until March 31 at 10:00AM CDT by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Strong Spring Storm to Bring Heavy Snow and Strong Winds to
the Region...
.A potent storm system brings a variety of impactful weather to
the region into Saturday morning. Early morning calls to Taylor
County did not reveal any issues, however with temperatures
hovering around freezing, will keep the winter weather advisory in
place for potential travel impacts on untreated, cold surfaces.
Tonight, widespread rain transitions to snow. The snow will be
heavy at times, especially along and north of Interstate 90 and
94 where 1 to 2&quot; per hour rates are expected. Currently, the
higher amounts from 6 to 89 inches are favored north of Highway
10 in north-central Wisconsin. Moving south toward Interstate 90,
2 to 6 inch accumulations are expected. The heavier snow may try
to push farther south, and there is uncertainty in how quickly
rain transitions to snow. Continue to monitor the forecast for
updates
In addition northwest winds will increase Friday night, gusting
from 35 to 45 mph. Visibilities will be further reduced in the
falling snow, with some drifting mostly in open areas.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM CDT THIS
MORNING...
...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 10 PM THIS EVENING TO
10 AM CDT SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Winter Weather Advisory, freezing rain.

* WHERE...Taylor County.
* WHEN...For the Winter Weather Advisory, until 10 AM CDT this
morning. For the Winter Storm Warning, from 10 PM this evening
to 10 AM CDT Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Widespread blowing
