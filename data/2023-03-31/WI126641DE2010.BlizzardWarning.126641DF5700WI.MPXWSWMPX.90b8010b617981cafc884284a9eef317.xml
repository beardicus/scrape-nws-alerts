blowing and drifting snow, with whiteout conditions at times.
A Blizzard Warning remains in effect overnight for a large area
from west central and southwest Minnesota to west central
Wisconsin. A Winter Storm Warning remains in effect north and
south of the Blizzard Warning.
...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 AM CDT SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions expected with total snow
accumulations of 5 to 10 inches. Winds gusting as high as 40
mph.
* WHERE...Portions of central, east central and south central
Minnesota and northwest and west central Wisconsin.
* WHEN...Now through 7 AM CDT Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be very difficult. Widespread blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility.</description>
<instruction>Travel should be restricted to emergencies only. If you must
travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded,
stay with your vehicle.
