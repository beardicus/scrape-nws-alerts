<description>...NEXT ROUND OF WINTRY WEATHER APPROACHES...
.A second round of snow will arrive for tonight, as precipitation
transitions over to a wintry mix from north-central WI
southeastwards. Snow totals will be highest across far northern WI.
Initial snow will likely be heavy and wet before gradually becoming
relatively lighter as cold air pushes in from the northeast.
Increasing winds overnight will likely create blowing and drifting
snow, especially towards Saturday morning. A fairly sharp cutoff in
snow totals is expected on the southern end of this system, mainly
just northwest of the Fox Valley.

SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 1 and 3
inches. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Brown, Door, and Outagamie Counties.
* WHEN...From 1 AM to 1 PM CDT Saturday.

snow could significantly reduce visibility. Gusty winds could
bring down tree branches.</description>
