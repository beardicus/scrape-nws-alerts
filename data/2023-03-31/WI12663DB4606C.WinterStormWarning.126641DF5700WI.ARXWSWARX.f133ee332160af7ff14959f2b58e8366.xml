<description>...Potent Spring Storm to Bring Heavy Snow and Strong Winds
Tonight...
.A potent storm moving across the Midwest will bring impactful
winter weather to the area tonight. Rain will transition to snow
this evening and continue overnight before diminishing around
sunrise. This snow will be heavy at times, especially north of
Interstate 90 where rates could exceed an inch per hour. Farther
north, across north-central Wisconsin, rates up to 2 inches an
hour will be possible overnight. Rates this high will cause rapid
accumulations to occur and with the heavy, wet nature of the snow,
power outages and tree damage could occur.
The highest totals of 6 inches or more will be possible for
portions of southeast Minnesota into west-central Wisconsin.
Amounts up to 10 inches could occur over portions of Taylor County
in north-central Wisconsin. Farther south, amounts of 2 to 6
inches are possible north of Interstate 90.
In addition northwest winds will increase tonight, gusting from
35 to 45 mph. Visibilities will be further reduced in the falling
snow, with some drifting mostly in open areas.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM TO 7 AM CDT
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 3 to 6
inches. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph. Highest snow totals
