<description>...BANDS OF MODERATE TO HEAVY SNOW SHOWERS LIKELY ACROSS EASTERN
KENAI PENINSULA AND EASTERN TURNAGAIN ARM THROUGH THURSDAY
MORNING...
Bands of moderate to heavy snow showers are likely across the
Seward Highway Corridor from Girdwood and Whittier south to
Seward Wednesday morning through Thursday morning.
While snow showers are expected at any time between this morning
and Thursday morning, the best chance for moderate to heavy snow
showers will be Wednesday morning through Wednesday evening and
again overnight Wednesday into early Thursday morning.
Snowfall rates in heavier snow showers could reach one to two
inches per hour, leading to significantly reduced visibilities.
Gusty winds Thursday morning could also result in localized areas
of blowing snow, especially near Whittier and Seward.
Additional snow accumulations of 6 inches or more are possible
for Whittier, Portage Valley, and Turnagain Pass through Thursday
morning. 1 to 3 inches of snow are possible from Summit Lake to
Seward.</description>
