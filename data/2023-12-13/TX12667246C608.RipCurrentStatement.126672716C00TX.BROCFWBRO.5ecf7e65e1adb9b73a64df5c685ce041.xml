<headline>Rip Current Statement issued December 13 at 2:50PM CST until December 15 at 6:00PM CST by NWS Brownsville</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH FRIDAY AFTERNOON...
...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM THIS EVENING TO
MIDNIGHT CST TONIGHT...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
For the Coastal Flood Statement, isolated minor coastal flooding
expected this evening with water nearing the dune line at narrow
beaches.
* WHERE...Kenedy Island, Willacy Island and Cameron Island
Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Friday
afternoon. For the Coastal Flood Statement, from 6 PM this
evening to midnight CST tonight.
* IMPACTS...Wave run-up may approach the dunes along narrow
beaches. Beach equipment, such as umbrellas and chairs, could be
moved by waves in these areas. Vehicles driving along narrow
beaches may experience higher water levels. Rip currents can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...High tide along the Isla Blanca jetty on
South Padre Island is at 729 PM. Continued easterly swell will
push water toward the dunes at narrow beaches for a few hours
after before receding overnight. Water is expected to reach into
the dunes in some spots at high tide Thursday evening, and
Coastal Flood Advisories are likely then.</description>
<instruction>If caught in a rip current, relax and float. Don`t swim against
the current. If able, swim in a direction following the
shoreline, then swim back to shore once out of the current. If
unable to escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Owners of beach equipment should stow the equipment or move
behind the dune line to be safe. Drivers are recommended to not
attempt driving the public access points tonight.</instruction>
