<instruction>Conditions favorable for coastal flooding are expected to
develop. Coastal residents should be alert for later statements
or warnings and take necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
High surf will affect the beaches in the advisory area, producing
localized beach erosion and dangerous swimming conditions.
Swimmers should remain out of the water due to large breaking
waves and dangerous surf conditions.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as jetties and
piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
Entering the water is not recommended. If caught in a rip
current, relax and float. Don`t swim against the current. If able,
swim in a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape,
face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
