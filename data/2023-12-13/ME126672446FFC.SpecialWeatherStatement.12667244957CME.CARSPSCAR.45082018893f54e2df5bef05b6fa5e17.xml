<headline>Special Weather Statement issued December 13 at 12:19AM EST  by NWS Caribou</headline>
<description>...An area of heavy snow showers will affect southeastern Aroostook
and north central Penobscot Counties...
At 1217 AM EST...An area of heavy snow showers was along a line
extending from near Oxbow to 11 miles west of Millinocket...and
moving east AT 40 MPH.
Locations impacted include...
Presque Isle, Houlton, Patten, East Millinocket, Mars Hill, Medway,
Hodgdon, Ashland, Easton, Sherman, Island Falls, Bridgewater, Smyrna,
Masardis, Amity, Mount Chase, Haynesville, Oxbow, Dudley Township,
and Cary Plantation.
This includes the following highways...
Interstate 95 between mile markers 243 and 304.
US Highway 1 between Orient and Mars Hill.
State Highway 11 between East Millinocket and Squapan.
* Winds in excess of 25 mph are possible with this area of heavy
snow showers.
* Visibilities will drop quickly to less than a half mile in this
area of heavy snow showers leading to brief whiteout conditions.
Travel is not advised during these heavy snow showers. Rapid
visibility reduction and potentially icy roads are likely to lead to
accidents. Consider delaying travel until the snow showers pass your
location. If traveling pull off to a safe location.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time when traveling.</description>
