<description>...An area of heavy snow showers will affect east central Aroostook
County...
At 442 AM EST...An area of heavy snow showers was along a line
extending from near Woodland to 20 miles west of Oxbox...and moving
east AT 40 MPH.
Locations impacted include...
Presque Isle, Caribou, Fort Fairfield, Limestone, Portage, Mapleton,
Washburn, Mars Hill, Ashland, Easton, Woodland, Bridgewater, Portage
Lake, Masardis, Oxbow, Loring, Scopan, Nashville Plantation, Blaine,
and New Sweden.
This includes the following highways...
US Highway 1 between Mars Hill and Caribou.
State Highway 11 between Masardis and Portage.
* Winds in excess of 25 mph are possible with this area of heavy
snow showers.
* Visibilities will drop quickly to less than a half mile in this
area of heavy snow showers producing whiteout conditions.
Travel is not advised during these heavy snow showers. Rapid
visibility reduction and potentially icy roads are likely to lead to
accidents. Consider delaying travel until the snow showers pass your
location. If traveling pull off to a safe location.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time when traveling.</description>
