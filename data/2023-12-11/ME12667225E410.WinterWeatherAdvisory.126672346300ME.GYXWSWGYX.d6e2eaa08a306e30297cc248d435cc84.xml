<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 11 at 12:00AM EST until December 11 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM BEGINS LATE TONIGHT...
.Rain will transition to heavy, wet snow after midnight tonight and
continue through much of the first half of Monday. Snowfall rates of
between 1 to 2 inches per hour are possible during the Monday
morning commute, making travel very difficult. Scattered power
outages are likely due to falling limbs from the sticky nature of
the snow combined with increasingly gusty winds Monday afternoon.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations up to 8 inches.
Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...In Maine, Central Somerset, Northern Franklin, and
Northern Oxford Counties. In New Hampshire, Northern Grafton and
Southern Coos Counties.
* WHEN...Until 7 PM EST Monday.
* IMPACTS...A winter storm will bring a period of snowfall to the
area. Although snowfall amounts will be lighter, travel will still
be impacted due to snowfall accumulations on untreated roads. The
potential exists for snowbands that will bring periods of locally
heavy snowfall, which will lead to rapid snow accumulations and
dangerous travel conditions. Heavy wet snow will cause weighted
tree limbs of conifers and leafed trees, leading to snapped
branches. Isolated to scattered outages possible. The hazardous
conditions could impact the Monday morning and evening commutes.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling. The latest road
conditions can be obtained by going to newengland511.org
Be prepared for slippery roads. Slow down and use caution while
driving. If you are going outside, watch your first few steps taken
on stairs, sidewalks, and driveways. These surfaces could be icy and
slippery, increasing your risk of a fall and injury.</instruction>
