<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON AKST
TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow and mixed precipitation. Additional snow
accumulations of 6 to 12 inches, except along the Richardson
Highway south of the Edgerton Cutoff, where an additional 12
to 20 inches is expected.
* WHERE...Copper River Basin.
* WHEN...Until noon AKST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on hazardous travel conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...This warning has been expanded to include
the remainder of the Richardson Highway to Paxson, as well as
the Tok Cutoff to Slana. Southerly Copper Valley winds have
resulted in heavy rain along the lower elevations of the
Edgerton Highway and McCarthy Road. Mixed precipitation and
rain below approximately 1400 ft will slowly transition back
to snow near Chitina by Tuesday morning. Refreezing of wet
roadways will produce hazardous travel conditions.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Warning for snow means severe winter weather
conditions will make travel very hazardous. If you must travel,
keep an extra flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case
of an emergency.
