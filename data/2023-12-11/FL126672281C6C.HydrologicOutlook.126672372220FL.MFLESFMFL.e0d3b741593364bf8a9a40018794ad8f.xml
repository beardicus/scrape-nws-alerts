<description>...Marginal Risk of Possible Flooding East Coast Areas Late This
Week...
The long range models are showing a stationary front over the
Florida Straits to move northward and into South Florida late this
week as high pressure slowly moves eastward over the Southeastern
United States. At the same time, a low pressure system will start
to form over the Central Gulf of Mexico. The low will continue to
move northeast into the Southeastern United States, as the warm
front moves into Central Florida next weekend.
This weather pattern will allow for a southwest steering flow to set
up over South Florida allowing for deep tropical moisture to work into
the area from the Southern Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. At
the same time, the surface winds will be east northeast allowing for
low level moisture to work into the east coast metro areas late
this week before going south southwest this weekend. These two
sources of moisture will allow for the PWAT values to increase to
around 2 inches, which are near the maximum PWAT values for this
time of year over South Florida.
Therefore, there could be some heavy rainfall over the eastern
areas of South Florida late this week into this weekend. At this
time, it looks like rainfall amounts up to 5 inches are possible
over the east coast metro areas late this week into this weekend
with locally higher amounts where any heavy rainfall sets up due
to training over the same area.
Will continue to monitor the latest model forecasts through the
week for the threat of heavy rainfall across the eastern areas of
South Florida.</description>
