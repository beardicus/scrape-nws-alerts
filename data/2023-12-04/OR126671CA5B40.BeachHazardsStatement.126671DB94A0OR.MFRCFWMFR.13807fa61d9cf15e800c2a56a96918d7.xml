<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued December 04 at 9:12PM PST until December 06 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH WEDNESDAY
MORNING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM TUESDAY TO 4 AM PST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...An extended period of sustained wave action is expected
to continue through Wednesday morning as a series of fronts
moves through the region. Multiple moderate to high swell trains
are expected with a moderate risk of sneaker waves. Also, a High
Surf Advisory has been issued to coincide with the largest
breaking waves of 20 to 30 ft, expected from Tuesday afternoon
into early Wednesday morning.
* WHERE...South Central Oregon Coast and Curry County Coast.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, through Wednesday
morning. For the High Surf Advisory, from 2 PM Tuesday to 4 AM
PST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Beaches will be hazardous places to be through the
middle of the week. Jetties and rocks are not safe places to
stand, and you will risk death if you are caught by waves on
them. Beach erosion is possible. Sneaker waves can run up
significantly farther on beaches than normal, including over
rocks and jetties. These waves can suddenly knock people off of
their feet and quickly pull them into the cold ocean waters,
resulting in serious injury or death. Waves may also lift
driftwood logs, trapping anyone caught underneath.

<instruction>Stay away from the surf zone and off of jetties. Area beaches may
become hazardous due to dangerous surf conditions.
Avoid climbing on rocks and jetties. Stay away from the ocean and
remain out of the water to avoid hazardous conditions.</instruction>
