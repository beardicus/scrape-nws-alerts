<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued December 04 at 2:38PM PST until December 05 at 4:00PM PST by NWS Eureka</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH TUESDAY
AFTERNOON...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM TUESDAY TO 8 AM PST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves 20 to 24
feet. For the Beach Hazards Statement, increased threat of
sneaker waves expected.
* WHERE...Coastal Del Norte, Northern Humboldt Coast and
Southwestern Humboldt Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, from 4 PM Tuesday to 8 AM
PST Wednesday. For the Beach Hazards Statement, through
Tuesday afternoon.. .
* IMPACTS...Dangerous surfing conditions and localized beach
erosion. Beachcombing is highly discouraged! Large, unexpected
waves can sweep across the beach without warning, sweeping
people into the sea from rocks, jetties, and beaches. These
sneaker waves can also move large objects such as logs,
crushing anyone caught underneath.</description>
<instruction>Large breaking waves along the coast will lead to increased wave
run-up on beaches with waves topping and washing over large rocks
and jetties. These large waves can be erratic and unpredictable.
Use extra caution near the surf zone as these large waves will be
capable of sweeping people into the frigid and turbulent ocean
water. Mariners traversing the bar are urged to exercise extreme
caution or stay in port until the threat subsides. Please contact
the U.S. Coast Guard for information regarding harbor and bar
closures.
Don`t be fooled by an ocean that looks calm. There can be
30 minutes of small waves before a sneaker wave strikes. Avoid
rocks and jetties. Avoid steep beaches. Stay much farther back
from the water and never turn your back on the ocean.</instruction>
