<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM EST THIS
MORNING...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation. Additional snow accumulations up to
two inches for a storm total of up to 6 inches and ice
accumulations around a light glaze.
* WHERE...Portions of southwest and western Maine and central New
Hampshire.
* WHEN...Until 10 AM EST this morning.
* IMPACTS...A weather system will bring a period of snowfall to the
region. Although snowfall amounts will be light, travel will still
be impacted due to snowfall accumulations on untreated roads.
Difficult travel conditions are possible due to icy road
conditions. Heavy wet snow will cause weighted tree limbs leading
to snapped branches. Isolated power outages possible. Even light
snowfall amounts can accumulate on roads and cause dangerous
driving conditions due to snow covered roads. The hazardous
conditions could impact the Monday morning commute.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling. The latest road
conditions can be obtained by going to newengland511.org
Be prepared for slippery roads. Slow down and use caution while
driving. If you are going outside, watch your first few steps taken
on stairs, sidewalks, and driveways. These surfaces could be icy and
slippery, increasing your risk of a fall and injury.</instruction>
