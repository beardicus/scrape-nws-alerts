<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop. If you encounter a flooded
road while driving, be sure to turn around and avoid driving through
the flooded roadway. Motorists should allow extra time for their
commute as ponding on roads will increase the risk of hydroplaning.</instruction>
