.A strong storm will impact western Washington over the next day and
a half, with the Cascades receiving an additional 6 to 9 inches of
rain. Snow levels will be over 8000 feet so it will all be rain.
This will drive many rivers flowing off the Cascades above flood
stage, with some moderate to major flood category.

Snohomish, Carnation, Snoqualmie Falls, Carnation, Issaquah,
Landsburg, Renton, Auburn...Major flooding is forecast.

widespread flooding of pasture lands and roads along the river
from the town of Snoqualmie downstream through Fall City. Roads
that may become flooded include Fall City-Carnation...Tolt Hill...
and Novelty Flats Roads. This river level on the Snoqualmie
corresponds roughly to a phase 3 flood in the King County flood
system.
