<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM THIS MORNING TO 11 PM EDT
THIS EVENING...
The Maine Department of Environmental Protection`s Bureau of Air
Quality has issued an Air Quality Alert for ozone from 11 AM to 11 PM
EDT today.
Ozone levels are expected to rise into the Unhealthy for Sensitive
Groups range along the Maine coast from Kittery through Acadia
National Park on Sunday. At elevated ozone levels, children, healthy
adults who exert themselves, and individuals suffering from a
respiratory disease such as asthma, bronchitis or COPD can experience
reduced lung function and irritation. When this happens, individuals
may notice a shortness of breath, coughing, throat irritation,
and/or experience an uncomfortable sensation in their chest. In
addition, particle pollution levels are expected to be moderate for
the same area. Although temperatures may not reach the Heat Alert
level, it will be warmer than in recent days so it is important to
remember that even in areas with moderate levels of ozone and
particle pollution the health impacts will be compounded by the
effects of heat and humidity.
The Maine Department of Environmental Protection recommends that
individuals consider limiting strenuous outdoor physical activity to
reduce the risk of adverse health effects. People who may be
especially sensitive to the effects of elevated levels of pollutants
include the very young, the elderly and those with pre-existing
respiratory problems such as asthma and or heart disease. Those with
symptoms should consider consulting their personal physician.
A toll free air quality hotline has been established so Maine
residents can stay informed on the air quality situations. The toll
free number is: 1-800-223-1196.
Additionally the Maine Department of Environmental Protection has
the air quality forecast available on the web at
