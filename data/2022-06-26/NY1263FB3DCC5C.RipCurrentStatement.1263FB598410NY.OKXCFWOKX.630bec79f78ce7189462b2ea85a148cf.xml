<headline>Rip Current Statement issued June 26 at 3:35PM EDT until June 27 at 9:00PM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY MORNING THROUGH
MONDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Dangerous rip currents expected.
* WHERE...Southwest Suffolk and Southeast Suffolk Counties.
* WHEN...From Monday morning through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...Life-threatening rip currents are likely for all
people entering the surf zone. Anyone visiting the beaches
should stay out of the surf. Rip currents can sweep even the
best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
