<description>...HEAT ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM PDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Hot temperatures of 95 to 105 in the valleys during the
afternoons and 85 to 95 at usually cooler mid-elevation
locations. Overnight lows will also be much warmer than
normal, generally in the mid 50s to lower 60s.
* WHERE...In California, Dunsmuir, Mount Shasta City, Tennant,
Macdoel, Dorris, and Tulelake. In Oregon, portions of the
South Central Oregon Cascades, Siskiyou Mountains, and
Southern Oregon Cascades including Crescent Lake, Union Creek,
and Howard Prairie. Also, much of the Upper Klamath Basin
including Keno, Klamath Falls, Bonanza, and Chiloquin.
* WHEN...Until 11 PM PDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Hot temperatures could cause heat illness.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The hottest day of this heat wave is
expected to be today, but temperatures on Monday are expected to
be only about 3 degrees cooler. On Monday the Heat Advisory area
is likely to be smaller due to the slight cooling. This heat
wave is likely to feel unusually hot to most due to fairly cool
temperatures, thus far, this warm season.

<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
