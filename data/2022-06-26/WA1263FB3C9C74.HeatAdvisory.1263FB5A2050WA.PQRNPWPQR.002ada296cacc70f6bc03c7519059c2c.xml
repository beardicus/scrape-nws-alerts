<headline>Heat Advisory issued June 26 at 4:57AM PDT until June 27 at 10:00PM PDT by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...HEAT ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Temperatures in the 90s expected.
* WHERE...I-5 Corridor in Cowlitz County.
* WHEN...Until 10 PM PDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Hot temperatures may cause heat illnesses to occur.
Rivers are running cold and fast this weekend, and will continue
to do so during the upcoming week. Nearly every year, people
die in rivers in southwest Washington and northwest Oregon due
to cold water shock during the season`s first heat wave. Hot
temperatures can make the cool water seem tempting, but river
temperatures in the 50s can easily result in cold water shock
that can kill in minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Today will likely be the hottest day, with
highs well into the 90s. Overnight low temperatures tonight will
be in the upper 50s to mid 60s. Highs Monday may be a touch
cooler than today, depending on whether cooler marine air
arrives earlier or later Monday afternoon.</description>
<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
