<headline>Heat Advisory issued June 26 at 4:57AM PDT until June 26 at 10:00PM PDT by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...HEAT ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Maximum temperatures of 85 to 95 degrees expected.
* WHERE...In Oregon, North Oregon Coast. In Washington, South
Washington Coast.
* WHEN...Until 10 PM PDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Hot temperatures may cause heat illnesses to occur.
Rivers are running cold and fast, and will continue to do so
this weekend. Nearly every year, people die in rivers in
southwest Washington and northwest Oregon due to cold water
shock during the season`s first heat wave. Hot temperatures
can make the cool water seem tempting, but river temperatures
in the 50s can easily result in cold water shock that can kill
in minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Main location of concern is for inland
areas away from the immediate coast. Today will be just as hot
as Saturday, and may even be a little hotter with potentially
more locations reaching 90 degrees this afternoon. A sharp drop
in temperatures is expected with the return of cooler marine air
this evening, with lows tonight likely to fall into the 50s.</description>
<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
