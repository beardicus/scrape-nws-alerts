<headline>Heat Advisory issued June 26 at 4:57AM PDT until June 27 at 10:00PM PDT by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...HEAT ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Temperatures up to 102 degrees expected.
* WHERE...In Oregon, Lower Columbia, Greater Portland Metro
Area, Upper Hood River Valley, Western Columbia River Gorge
and Central Columbia River Gorge. In Washington, Greater
Vancouver Area, Western Columbia River Gorge and Central
Columbia River Gorge.
* WHEN...Until 10 PM PDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Hot temperatures may cause heat illnesses to occur.
Rivers are running cold and fast, and will continue to do so
this weekend. Nearly every year, people die in rivers in
southwest Washington and northwest Oregon due to cold water
shock during the season`s first heat wave. Hot temperatures
can make the cool water seem tempting, but river temperatures
in the 50s can easily result in cold water shock that can kill
in minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Today is expected to be the hottest day
with highs in the mid to upper 90s, locally to 102. Maximum
temperatures Monday are expected to be a few degrees cooler, in
the lower to mid 90s. Nighttime temperatures are expected to be
in the upper 50s to upper 60s, with urban areas and elevated
terrain likely the warmest.</description>
<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
