<headline>Heat Advisory issued June 26 at 12:24PM PDT until June 27 at 10:00PM PDT by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...HEAT ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Afternoon temperatures 85 to 95.
* WHERE...South Washington Cascades and South Washington Cascade
Foothills.
* WHEN...Until 10 PM PDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Hot temperatures may cause heat illnesses. Rivers are
running cold and fast this weekend, and will continue to do so
during the upcoming week. Nearly every year, people die in
rivers in southwest Washington and northwest Oregon due to cold
water shock during the season`s first heat wave. Hot
temperatures can make the cool water seem tempting, but river
temperatures in the 50s can easily result in cold water shock
that can kill in minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Temperatures will struggle to cool off
tonight, especially on mid and upper slopes where temperatures
may remain above 70 degrees for most if not all of the night.
Wind-sheltered valley bottoms will be considerably cooler
tonight.</description>
<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
