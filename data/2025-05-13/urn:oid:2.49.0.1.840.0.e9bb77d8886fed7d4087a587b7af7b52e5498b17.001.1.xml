The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has issued a

* Flash Flood Warning for...
Central Laurens County in upstate South Carolina...

* Until 630 AM EDT.

* At 1251 AM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated
training thunderstorms have been producing heavy rain across
central and eastern portions of Laruens County.  Storm-total
rainfall of 2 and 4 inches of rain have fallen over the past three
hours, with the heaviest totals from Waterloo to Laurens.  An
additional 1-2 inches of rainfall is possible across the warned
area over the next 60-90 minutes.  Several small streams are
expected to quickly rise out of their banks and will be capable of
producing Minor to isolated Moderate flash flooding across the
warned area, including Cane Creek near Waterloo and Harris
Springs, the Little River near Laurens, and Duncan Creek near
Ora.  As these storms train over the city of Laurens, storm drains
and culverts may be quickly overwhelmed creating areas of roadway
and property flooding.  Flooding of Little River Park is likely.

* Areas of immediate concern include near Harris Springs Rd (SC 19)
and Blakely Rd, Neely Ferry Rd (SC 54), US 221 near Waterloo, and
Little River in Laurens.  Drivers are urged to avoid flooded
roadways.Flash flooding of roadways may occur.  Inundation of
low-lying areas, including parks, greenways, and campgrounds may
reach several feet deep.  Seek higher ground now!

HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.

SOURCE...Radar and automated gauges.

IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban
areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as
other poor drainage and low-lying areas.  A few
culverts may be washed out.

* Some locations that may experience flash flooding include...
Laurens, Clinton, Ware Shoals, Joanna, Cross Hill, Waterloo,
Mountville and Ora.

Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.</instruction>
