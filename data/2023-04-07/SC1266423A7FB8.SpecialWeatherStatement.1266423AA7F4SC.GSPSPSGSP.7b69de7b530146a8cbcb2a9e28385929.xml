<description>...SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WITH TORRENTIAL RAINFALL WILL IMPACT
EAST CENTRAL GREENVILLE AND WESTERN SPARTANBURG COUNTIES UNTIL 645
AM EDT...
At 537 AM EDT, Doppler radar was tracking a series of showers and
thunderstorms moving northeast at 5 mph along the Interstate 85
corridor and across the greater Greer, SC area. These showers and
thunderstorms were producing rainfall at rates of one to two inches
per hour.
Locations to be impacted include...
Spartanburg, Greenville Downtown, Greer, Taylors, Five Forks, Duncan,
Lyman, Wellford, Inman and Roebuck.
The heavy rainfall rates will lead to deep ponding of water in poor
drainage spots on area roadways.</description>
<instruction>Torrential rainfall may flood areas with poor drainage, such as
ditches and underpasses. Avoid these areas and do not cross flooded
roads. Water levels of small streams may also rise rapidly. Seek
higher ground if threatened by flood waters.</instruction>
