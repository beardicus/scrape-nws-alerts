<description>...RISES ON STREAMS AND RIVERS EXPECTED DUE TO SNOWMELT AND RAIN...
Small streams and large rivers coming out of the mountains will see
rises over the weekend and through the first half of next week.
Showers this afternoon and evening may produce locally moderate to
heavy precipitation, especially from the mountains of central Oregon
through the eastern mountains of Oregon. A chance for more prolonged
precipitation will begin Saturday across the Washington Cascades,
spreading southeastward and encompassing much of the forecast area
by Monday into Tuesday. Uncertainty lies in where exactly the band
of heaviest precipitation will occur Monday and Tuesday, but
expectation is that the largest rises in rivers, streams, and creeks
will occur during this period.
While only a few gauges are expected to even approach bankfull, much
could change with the rain forecast between now and early next week.
As of now, however, flooding is not expected to occur with this
round of rainfall over the next several days.
This Hydrologic Outlook will be updated again Saturday with
the latest updates to the forecast.</description>
