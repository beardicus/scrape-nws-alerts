<description>...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 315 PM EDT THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...A portion of central North Carolina, including the
following counties, Harnett and Wake.
* WHEN...Until 315 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring. Numerous roads
remain closed due to flooding.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1253 PM EDT, local law enforcement reported continued
flooding and road closures across southern Wake County and
northern Harnett County. Portions of Purfoy Road are closed
north of Holland Road. NC 55 near Delaney Hills Lane is also
experiencing flooding. It will take several hours for runoff
from this morning`s heavy rainfall to recede.  While rainfall
is light at the moment, additional moderate to heavy rainfall
will overspread the area once again later this afternoon
which could lead to additional flooding.

Garner, Fuquay-Varina, Holly Springs, Duncan, Raven Rock
State Park and Lake Benson.

enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
