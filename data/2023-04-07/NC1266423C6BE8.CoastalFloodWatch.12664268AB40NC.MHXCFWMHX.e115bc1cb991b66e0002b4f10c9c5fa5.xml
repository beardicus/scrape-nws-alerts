<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY MORNING
THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY EVENING THROUGH
MONDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Watch, up to 2 to 4 feet of
inundation above ground level possible in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways. For the Beach Hazards Statement,
dangerous rip currents, large breaking waves expected, and
strong longshore currents in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Eastern Carteret County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Watch, from Saturday evening
through Monday morning. For the Beach Hazards Statement, from
Saturday morning through Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...Up to 2 to 4 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in some areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in an elevated threat of property damage. Flooding
will extend inland from the waterfront threatening some homes
and businesses. Numerous road closures and flooding of vehicles
will be possible. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers
away from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore break can
throw a swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom causing
neck and back injuries. Strong longshore currents will create
dangerous swimming conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Prolonged northeast winds will bring the
greatest impacts along soundside locations. Conditions will
continue to deteriorate through Saturday with greatest impacts
expected Saturday night and Sunday.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
