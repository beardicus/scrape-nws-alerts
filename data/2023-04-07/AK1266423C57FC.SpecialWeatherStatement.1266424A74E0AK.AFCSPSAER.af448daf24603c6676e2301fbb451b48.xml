<description>...ACCUMULATING SNOW LIKELY THROUGH THE WEEKEND...
A complex area of low pressure moving toward the region from the
Gulf of Alaska will bring accumulating snow to the eastern Kenai
Peninsula, mainly from Portage Valley to Moose Pass, for the
weekend. An initial round of light snow showers will develop
Saturday morning and could taper off briefly Saturday evening
through Saturday night before a second round of heavier snow
develops Sunday morning. Heaviest snowfall rates will likely be
Sunday morning with light snow continuing through the day before
tapering off Sunday night.
Although there is still uncertainty in the exact track and timing
of this system, 4 to 8 inches of snow is likely from Girdwood to
Whittier and along the Seward Highway from Portage Valley to
Summit Lake, with locally higher amounts possible. 3 to 6 inches
of snow is likely for Moose Pass with lesser amounts south to
Seward.
Visibility may also be reduced at times Sunday morning due to the
combination of potentially higher snowfall rates and resuspended
snow from vehicular traffic.
