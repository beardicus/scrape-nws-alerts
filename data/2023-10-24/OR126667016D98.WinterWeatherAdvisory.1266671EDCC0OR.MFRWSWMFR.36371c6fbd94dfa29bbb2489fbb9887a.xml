<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 5 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO
9 PM PDT WEDNESDAY ABOVE 4000 FEET...
* WHAT...Wet snow expected at elevations as low as 3500 feet.
Total snow accumulations of 2 to 4 inches at elevations between
4000 and 5000 feet, and 4 to 10 inches above 5000 feet.
Southwest to west winds gusting at 20 to 40 mph.
* WHERE...South Central Oregon Cascades and Southern Oregon
Cascades, from Lake of the Woods northward. Impacts will be
mainly around Crater Lake, but also including Willamette Pass,
Diamond Lake, and Lake of the Woods. This includes portions of
highways 140, 62, 230, 138, and 58.
* WHEN...From 5 PM this afternoon to 9 PM PDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions, primarily early
Wednesday morning, and with colder temperatures behind the snow
late Wednesday night.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow levels will be near 5500 to 6500 feet
as precipitation begins late this afternoon. Snow levels will
fall overnight to around 3500 to 4500 feet, then remain near
that level through Wednesday evening. Snowfall rates will be
highest late tonight into Wednesday morning. During this early
season event, accumulation will be mainly off of paved surfaces
with snow melting as it hits roadways. This will still create
slippery roadways, including with freezing temperatures as snow
tapers off late Wednesday night.
