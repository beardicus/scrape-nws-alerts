<senderName>NWS Monterey (The San Francisco area)</senderName>
<headline>Flood Watch issued January 02 at 12:09PM PST until January 03 at 11:30AM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>.A potent Pineapple Express will move into the region Wednesday and
continue into Thursday. This will bring substantial rainfall to the
Bay Area and Monterey Bay region on top of already saturated soils.
As a result look for rapid rises in area creeks, streams, and
rivers. Bankfull exceedance is possible. In addition strong gusty
winds will bring branches and trees down, which may cause localized
damming of water ways. Rain will taper by Thursday afternoon,
allowing for rivers to level off and begin to lower.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...Bay Area and Monterey Bay Regions. Including Sonoma, Napa,
Marin, Contra Costa, Alameda, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa
Clara, Santa Cruz, San Benito, and Monterey Counties.
* WHEN...From late Tuesday night through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water crossings may be
flooded. Storm drains and ditches may become clogged with debris.
Extensive street flooding and flooding of creeks and rivers are
possible.
