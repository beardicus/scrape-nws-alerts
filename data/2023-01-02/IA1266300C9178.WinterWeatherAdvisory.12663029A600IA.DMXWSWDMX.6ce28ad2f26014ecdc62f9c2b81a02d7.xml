<description>...Significant Ice Storm Potential Over Northern Iowa Tonight into
Tuesday...
.A winter storm will spread mixed precipitation across the Upper
Midwest from later today into Tuesday. A mix of freezing rain and
snow is anticipated in parts of northwest and north central Iowa,
with a potential for significant ice accumulations by sunrise
Tuesday. During the day Tuesday, much of the precipitation will
transition to rain before changing to snow late Tuesday afternoon
and overnight. In this update, there has been a southward shift in
the potential axis of ice accumulations which has resulted in an
expansion of the Ice Storm Warning. With this recent shift, higher
snowfall accumulations could result over the northwest and far north
central Iowa. Travel impacts are likely during this time frame, with
the potential for power outages.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM THIS
EVENING TO 6 PM CST TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Ice accumulations of up
to a quarter of an inch are possible.
* WHERE...Portions of north central Iowa.
* WHEN...From 6 PM Monday to 6 PM CST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Power outages and tree damage are possible due to the
ice. Travel could be very treacherous. The hazardous conditions
could impact the Monday evening and Tuesday morning commutes.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
For the latest travel conditions, check the Iowa 511 app,
