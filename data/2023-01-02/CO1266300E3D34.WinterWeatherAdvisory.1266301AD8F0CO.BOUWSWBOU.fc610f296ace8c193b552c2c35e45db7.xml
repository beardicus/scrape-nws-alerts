freezing drizzle possible over the plains. Slick travel can be
expected at times due to the snow and locally light ice

urban corridor and mountains by late evening, however will linger
overnight across the northeast plains.

EVENING...

up to one inch and ice accumulations around a light glaze.
* WHERE...Fort Collins, and Greeley.

hazardous conditions could impact the Monday evening commute.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling. The latest road
conditions for Colorado can be obtained by calling 5 1 1 or by going
