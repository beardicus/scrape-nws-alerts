<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 02 at 3:28PM CST until January 04 at 6:00PM CST by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>.A complex and potent winter storm will cause travel impacts
starting this evening, lasting through Wednesday. The worst
conditions will be Tuesday morning and early afternoon.
This evening, a wintry mix of rain, sleet, and ice will develop
across southern Minnesota. Some locations may see over a quarter
of an inch of ice, and an Ice Storm Warning is in effect. Later
tonight into early Tuesday morning, heavy snow will move into
southwest Minnesota, and spread across central Minnesota and
western Wisconsin Tuesday morning into early Tuesday afternoon.
Snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour are likely for a few
hours, which will cause significant travel impacts as visibility
drops to a quarter mile at times due to the heavy snow. A Winter
Storm Warning is in effect for this heavy snow, with generally
over 8 inches of snow expected with over a foot possible over
portions of west central and southwest Minnesota. Elsewhere, a
Winter Weather Advisory is in effect for areas that will see a
wintry mix, and less snow.
Please adjust your travel plans for Tuesday if possible.

CST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation expected. Total snow
accumulations of 6 to 11 inches and ice accumulations of a
light glaze.
* WHERE...Portions of central, east central and west central
Minnesota and northwest and west central Wisconsin.
* WHEN...From 6 AM Tuesday to 6 PM CST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Patchy blowing snow

will impact the Tuesday commutes.</description>
