<description>.A winter storm will cause travel impacts starting this evening,
and lasting into Wednesday. The worst conditions will be Tuesday
morning and early afternoon.
On Monday evening a wintry mix of rain, sleet, and ice will

quarter of an inch of ice, and an Ice Storm Warning is in effect.
On Monday night heavy snow will move into southwest Minnesota,
and spread across central Minnesota and western Wisconsin Tuesday

expected, with isolated amounts over a foot possible. Elsewhere,
a Winter Weather Advisory is in effect for areas that will see a
wintry mix, and less snow. Please adjust your travel plans for
Tuesday if possible.
