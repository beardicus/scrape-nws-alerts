<headline>Flood Watch issued January 02 at 12:51PM PST until January 02 at 10:00PM PST by NWS Eureka</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of northwest California, including the following
areas, Mendocino Coast, Northeastern Mendocino Interior, Northern
Humboldt Coast, Northern Lake, Northwestern Mendocino Interior,
Southeastern Mendocino Interior, Southern Humboldt Interior,
Southern Lake, Southern Trinity, Southwestern Humboldt and
Southwestern Mendocino Interior.
* WHEN...From late Tuesday night through Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Storm drains and ditches may become clogged with debris. Area
creeks and streams are running high and could flood with more
heavy rain. In addition area rivers including the Russian,
Navarro, Garcia, Mad, and Eel Rivers are expected to rise several
feet.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A moderate to strong atmospheric river will bring more heavy
rain to the area early Wednesday morning into Thursday. 3 to
4 inches of rain are expected at low elevations with 4.5 to 6
inches of rain at higher elevations. Already saturated soils
will contribute to enhanced runoff.

Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
