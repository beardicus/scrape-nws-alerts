<description>...SNOW CONTINUES IN THE MOUNTAINS WITH SNOW AND FREEZING DRIZZLE
CONTINUING OVER THE PLAINS AND URBAN CORRIDOR TODAY...
.Widespread snow, mostly light to moderate in intensity, will
continue for most of the region through the early morning hours.
Snow will become more scattered in nature after daybreak Monday,
when the I-25 corridor and plains are expected to see the
development of freezing drizzle. By the afternoon, snow showers are
expected to return to most areas and increase in coverage once
again. Slick travel can be expected at times due to the snow and
locally light ice accumulations, including for both the morning and
evening commutes. Snow will taper off for the urban corridor and
mountains in the late afternoon and evening respectively, however
will linger through Monday night in the northeast plains.

TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Snow ongoing. Additional snow accumulations between 3 and 7
inches expected.

corridor and Eisenhower Tunnel.
* WHEN...Until Midnight MST tonight.
* IMPACTS...Snow covered roads will make travel hazardous.</description>
