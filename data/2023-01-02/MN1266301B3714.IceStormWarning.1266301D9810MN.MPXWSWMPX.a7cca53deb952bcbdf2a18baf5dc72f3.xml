The worst conditions will be Tuesday morning and early afternoon
when heavy band of precipitation lifts up from the south across
the region.
Overnight a wintry mix of rain, sleet, and ice will develop

of an inch of ice, and an Ice Storm Warning is in effect.Tuesday
morning, heavy snow will move into southwest Minnesota, and
spread across central Minnesota and western Wisconsin into early
Tuesday afternoon. Several hours with snowfall rates of 1 to 2
inches per hour are likely, which will cause significant travel
impacts as visibility drops to a quarter mile at times due to the
heavy snow. A Winter Storm Warning is in effect for this heavy
snow, with generally 5 to 9 inches of snow expected, with the
highest amounts across portions of west central and southwest
Minnesota. Elsewhere, a Winter Weather Advisory is in effect for
areas that will see a wintry mix, and less snow.
The warnings will end later this evening, and transition to a

persist through Wednesday. Most locations can expect an additional
2 to 5 inches of snow during period. Please adjust your travel
plans for Tuesday if possible.
