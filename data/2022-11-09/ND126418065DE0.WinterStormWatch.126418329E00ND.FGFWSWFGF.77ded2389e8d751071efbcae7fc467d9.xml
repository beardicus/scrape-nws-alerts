<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST TODAY...
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THIS EVENING THROUGH
FRIDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...For the Winter Weather Advisory this morning, freezing
rain expected. Total ice accumulations up to one tenth of an
inch through midday. For the Winter Storm Watch, blizzard
conditions possible. Total snow accumulations late tonight into
Friday of 4 to 12 inches and ice accumulations of around three
tenths of an inch possible. Winds could gust as high as 55 mph.
* WHERE...Barnes, Cass, Ransom and Sargent Counties.
* WHEN...For the Winter Weather Advisory, until noon CST today.
For the Winter Storm Watch, from this evening through Friday
afternoon.
* IMPACTS...For the advisory this morning, slick travel conditions
are expected during the morning commute. For the watch period,
power outages and tree damage are likely due to the ice. Travel
could be nearly impossible. Widespread blowing snow could
significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions could
impact the morning or evening commute. Gusty winds could bring
down tree branches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...After the period of freezing rain this
morning there should be a lull in activity through early
evening. During the watch period if freezing rain or sleet
persists then snow totals may decrease. Uncertainty remains for
the areas that could receive the heaviest snow and timing and
coverage of freezing rain or sleet. This will create large
spread in potential impacts, and the storm track could still
shift.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling. Prepare for possible
power outages.
Prepare for possible blizzard conditions. Continue to monitor the
latest forecasts for updates on this situation.
