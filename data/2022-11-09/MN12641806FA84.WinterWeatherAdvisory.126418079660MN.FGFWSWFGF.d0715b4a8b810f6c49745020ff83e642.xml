<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued November 09 at 8:01AM CST until November 09 at 12:00PM CST by NWS Eastern ND and Grand Forks</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST TODAY...
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH
FRIDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...For the Winter Weather Advisory this morning , freezing
rain. Ice accumulations of a light glaze to one tenth of an
inch. For the Winter Storm Watch tonight, blizzard conditions
possible. Total snow accumulations of 6 to 14 inches, with
potential for small areas of higher amounts and ice
accumulations of around two tenths of an inch possible. Winds
could gust as high as 55 mph.
* WHERE...In Minnesota, West Polk County. In North Dakota,
Nelson and Grand Forks Counties.
* WHEN...For the Winter Weather Advisory, until noon CST today.
For the Winter Storm Watch, from late tonight through Friday
afternoon.
* IMPACTS...For the advisory this morning, slick travel conditions
are expected during the morning commute. For the watch, travel
could be very difficult to impossible. Widespread blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions
could impact the morning or evening commute. Strong winds could
cause extensive damage to trees and power lines.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...After the period of freezing rain this
morning there should be a lull in winter impacts through early
evening. For the watch period, uncertainty remains for the
areas that could receive the heaviest snow and timing and
coverage of freezing rain or sleet. This will create large
spread in potential impacts, and the storm track could still
shift.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling. Prepare for possible
power outages.
Prepare for possible blizzard conditions. Continue to monitor the
latest forecasts for updates on this situation.
