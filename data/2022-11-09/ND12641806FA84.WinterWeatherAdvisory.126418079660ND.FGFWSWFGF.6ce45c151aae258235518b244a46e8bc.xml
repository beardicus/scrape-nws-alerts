<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST
TODAY...
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH
FRIDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...For the Winter Weather Advisory this morning, freezing
rain expected. Total ice accumulations up to one tenth of an
inch through midday. For the Winter Storm Watch, blizzard
conditions possible. Total snow accumulations late tonight
into Friday of 6 to 14 inches, with potential for small areas
of higher amounts and ice accumulations of around two tenths
of an inch possible. Winds could gust as high as 55 mph.
* WHERE...Griggs, Steele and Traill Counties.
* WHEN...For the Winter Weather Advisory, until noon CST today.
For the Winter Storm Watch, from late tonight through Friday
afternoon.
* IMPACTS...For the advisory this morning, slick travel
conditions are expected during the morning commute. For the
watch period, travel could be very difficult to impossible.
Widespread blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility.
The hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute. Gusty winds could bring down tree branches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...After the period of freezing rain this
morning there should be a lull in winter impacts through early
evening. For the watch period, uncertainty remains for the
areas that could receive the heaviest snow and timing and
coverage of freezing rain or sleet. This will create large
spread in potential impacts, and the storm track could still
shift.</description>
