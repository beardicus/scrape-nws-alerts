<description>...Winter Storm Tonight into Thursday...
.Areas of freezing drizzle will continue this evening to the east
of the Black Hills. A winter storm will then quickly move from
the Rockies into the northern Plains tonight through Thursday. It
will spread a swath of precipitation into northeastern Wyoming and
western South Dakota. Mostly snow is expected over northeastern
Wyoming, the Black Hills, and into northwestern South Dakota. Some
freezing rain and drizzle will occur east of the Black Hills this
evening, especially across central South Dakota, but will
eventually change to snow later tonight. Gusty northerly winds
will develop late tonight into Thursday which will create areas of
blowing snow and greatly reduced visibilities where accumulating
snow falls.

and warnings.
