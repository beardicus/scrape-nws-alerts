<description>...Winter Storm Tonight into Thursday...
.Areas of freezing drizzle will continue this evening to the east
of the Black Hills. A winter storm will then quickly move from
the Rockies into the northern Plains tonight through Thursday. It
will spread a swath of precipitation into northeastern Wyoming
and western South Dakota. Mostly snow is expected over
northeastern Wyoming, the Black Hills, and into northwestern
South Dakota. Some freezing rain and drizzle will occur east of
the Black Hills this evening, especially across central South
Dakota, but will eventually change to snow later tonight. Gusty
northerly winds will develop late tonight into Thursday which
will create areas of blowing snow and greatly reduced
visibilities where accumulating snow falls.
