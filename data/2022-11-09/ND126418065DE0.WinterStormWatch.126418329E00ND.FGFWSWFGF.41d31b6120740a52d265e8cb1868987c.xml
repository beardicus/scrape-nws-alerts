<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued November 09 at 4:00AM CST until November 11 at 6:00PM CST by NWS Eastern ND and Grand Forks</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THIS EVENING THROUGH
FRIDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions possible. Total snow accumulations
of 6 to 14 inches and ice accumulations of one tenth to three
tenths of an inch possible. Winds could gust as high as 55 mph.
* WHERE...Richland County.
* WHEN...From this evening through Friday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be nearly impossible. Widespread
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute. Power outages and tree damage are possible due to the
ice where freezing rain occurs.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...If freezing rain or sleet persists then
snow totals may decrease. Uncertainty remains for the areas
that could receive the heaviest snow and timing and coverage
of freezing rain or sleet. This will create large spread in
potential impacts, and the storm track could still shift.</description>
<instruction>Prepare for possible blizzard conditions. Continue to monitor the
latest forecasts for updates on this situation.</instruction>
