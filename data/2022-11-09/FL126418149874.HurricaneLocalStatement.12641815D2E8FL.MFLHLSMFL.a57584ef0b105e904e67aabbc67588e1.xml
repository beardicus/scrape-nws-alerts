SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Nicole is currently located just west of Grand Bahama and
is moving west-northwest and is forecast to landfall on the east-
central coast of Florida tonight.
The following are the primary hazards of concern with Nicole:
* Coastal Flooding/Surge - Higher than usual tides due to the
combination of surge from Nicole and the recent full moon are
currently occurring over Southeast Florida. Moderate tidal flooding is
being observed along much of the east coast with peak inundation
values up to 3 ft over the Northern Palm Beach coastline. Large
breaking/life threatening waves are expected along the east coast with
the worst conditions expected along Palm Beach. Water levels will
begin to decrease early Thursday morning and only minor tidal flooding
will be possible thereafter.
* Rainfall - The majority of the rainfall associated with the system
is forecast to fall through Thursday morning. The greatest risk for
flash flooding will be near the coast over the next few hours when
tides remain elevated. Fairly widespread storm total rain amounts of
2-4&quot; with localized amounts in excess of 6 inches are possible over
the area. The highest amounts are anticipated over Palm Beach county
and the Lake region.
* Wind - Based on the current forecast for Nicole, the reasonable
worst case scenario is for tropical storm force winds particularly
across portions of Palm Beach county, Lake Okeechobee, and coastal
Broward county. Tropical storm force winds have already been observed
along coastal Palm Beach, with occasional tropical storm gusts across
Broward county and inland Palm Beach county.
* Tornadoes - A low-end tornado threat is currently forecast tonight
into early Thursday as banding from the system moves ashore along the
Florida east coast. The greatest potential for tornadoes will be along
northern Palm Beach county.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
Palm Beach County. Remain well sheltered from dangerous
wind having possible significant impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
Potential impacts from the main wind event are also now unfolding
across coastal Broward, Glades, and Hendry counties. Remain well sheltered from
hazardous wind having possible limited impacts.
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across
the Palm Beach and Broward coasts. Remain well away from
life-threatening surge having additional significant impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
Potential impacts from the main surge event are also now unfolding
across Miami-Dade and Collier counties. Remain well away from locally
hazardous surge having possible limited impacts.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are unfolding across
the Palm Beach region and Broward county. Remain well guarded against
dangerous flood waters having possible significant impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- Ditches and canals may quickly become swollen with swift
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
the rest of South Florida. Remain well guarded against locally
hazardous flood waters having possible limited impacts.
* TORNADOES:
Potential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across northern
portions of Palm Beach and Glades counties. Remain well braced
against a tornado event having possible limited impacts. If realized,
these impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, mobile
homes pushed off foundations or overturned, large tree tops and
branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving
vehicles blown off roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.
Elsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Do not enter evacuated areas until officials have given the all clear
to return.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Keep your cell phone charged and in power-saving mode. If you lose
power, use it sparingly and mainly for personal emergencies and
check-ins.
If you are prone to flooding or in an area under a storm surge watch
or warning, be prepared for the possibility of a quick and dramatic
rise in water levels.
