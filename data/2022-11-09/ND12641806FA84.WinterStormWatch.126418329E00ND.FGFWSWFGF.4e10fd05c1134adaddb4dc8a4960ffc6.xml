<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH
FRIDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions possible. Total snow accumulations
of 6 to 14 inches, with potential for small areas of higher
amounts and ice accumulations of around two tenths of an inch
possible. Winds could gust as high as 55 mph.
* WHERE...In Minnesota, Norman, Clay and Wilkin Counties. In
North Dakota, Eddy County.
* WHEN...From late tonight through Friday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible.
Widespread blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility.
The hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute. Strong winds could cause extensive damage to trees
and power lines.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Uncertainty remains for the areas that
could receive the heaviest snow and timing and coverage of
freezing rain or sleet. This will create large spread in
potential impacts, and the storm track could still shift.</description>
<instruction>Prepare for possible blizzard conditions. Continue to monitor the
latest forecasts for updates on this situation.</instruction>
