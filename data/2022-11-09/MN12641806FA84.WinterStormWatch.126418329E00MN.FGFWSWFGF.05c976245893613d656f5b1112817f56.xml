<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST TODAY...
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY MORNING
THROUGH FRIDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...For the Winter Weather Advisory this morning, freezing
rain expected. Total ice accumulations up to one tenth of an
inch through midday. For the Winter Storm Watch, blizzard
conditions possible. Total snow accumulations late tonight into
Friday of 6 to 14 inches, with potential for small areas of
higher amounts and ice accumulations of around two tenths of an
inch possible. Winds could gust as high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...In Minnesota, West Marshall County. In North Dakota,
Eastern Walsh County.
* WHEN...For the Winter Weather Advisory, until noon CST today.
For the Winter Storm Watch, from Thursday morning through
Friday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...For the advisory this morning, slick travel conditions
are expected during the morning commute. For the watch tonight,
widespread blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility.
The hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute. Gusty winds could bring down tree branches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...After the period of freezing rain this
morning there should be a lull in winter impacts through early
evening. For the watch period, uncertainty remains for the
areas that could receive the heaviest snow and timing and
coverage of freezing rain or sleet. This will create large
spread in potential impacts, and the storm track could still
shift.</description>
