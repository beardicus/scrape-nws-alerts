Mostly snow is expected over northeastern Wyoming, the Black Hills
and northwestern South Dakota. Freezing rain will occur east of
the Black Hills tonight, but will eventually change to snow
overnight. Gusty northerly winds will develop late tonight into

reduced visibilities where accumulating snow falls.
