<description>...Moderate to heavy snow along I-80 in northern Nevada...
Moderate to heavy snow at times will affect portions of northern
Lander and Eureka counties eastward into Elko county through the
late afternoon hours. These snow rates could bring rapidly
deteriorating road conditions and significantly reduced
visibility. Portions of I-80 east of Battle Mountain to Pequop
Summit in addition to state routes 225 and 227 near Elko and US
routes 93 from Wells to Lages Junction are expected to see impacts
to travel from this snow event. In addition, much colder
temperatures are on the way tonight which could make snow linger
on untreated road surfaces longer. 1-2 inches of additional snow
with localized amounts of 3 inches are possible through 700 pm.
Snow intensity is expected to decrease this evening with a few
light snow showers lingering through late this evening.
Motorists should plan for near white out conditions, snow
covered roads, and drifting snow in some locations. Travel is not
recommended due to the intense rate of snowfall.
