<headline>Freezing Fog Advisory issued November 09 at 1:09PM PST until November 10 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...FREEZING FOG ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM TO 10 AM PST
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Visibility as low as a quarter of a mile and slick
surfaces due to freezing fog.
* WHERE...Most portions of the Klamath Basin, inlcuding Klamath
Falls, Modoc Point, Chiloquin, Bonanza, and Keno, and portions
of highways 97 and 140.
* WHEN...From 4 AM to 10 AM PST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous driving conditions due to low visibility and
slick road surfaces. Walking surfaces may become hazardous.
* View the hazard area in detail at
https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/map/?wfo=mfr</description>
<instruction>* If possible, wait for temperatures to warm above freezing
before traveling.
* Slow down and give 3 times as much space as normal between
vehicles.
* Shaded areas may be more slippery than unshaded areas.
* Use low beams. High beams reflect back fog making visibility
worse for you and other drivers.
* Fog makes objects appear farther away than they are.
* Be ready for low visibility by keeping your headlights clean.
* Don`t use cruise control. Most crashes occur because the
driver is going too fast for weather conditions.</instruction>
