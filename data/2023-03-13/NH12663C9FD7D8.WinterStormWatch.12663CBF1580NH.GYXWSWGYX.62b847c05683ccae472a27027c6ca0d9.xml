<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued March 13 at 3:26AM EDT until March 15 at 8:00AM EDT by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...SIGNIFICANT WINTER STORM TONIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...
.Rapidly strengthening low pressure will approach southern New
England tonight, with snow overspreading the area through Tuesday
morning. Greatest snowfall will likely fall at higher terrain across
the Monadnocks, Sunapee, the Ossippees, and White Mountains. At
lower elevations, snow may be heavy and wet, resulting in possible
snow load impacts and power outages. Gusty northeast to north winds
Tuesday could accentuate power outage risk.
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THIS EVENING THROUGH
WEDNESDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 6 to 12
inches possible, with locally higher amounts. Winds could gust as
high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Northern Carroll, Northern Grafton, and Southern Grafton
Counties.
* WHEN...From this evening through Wednesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Significant snowfall and periods of heavy snowfall rates
may combine with low visibility to create very dangerous driving
conditions. The hazardous conditions could impact the Tuesday
morning and evening commutes. The strong winds and weight of snow
on tree limbs may down power lines and could cause sporadic power
outages.</description>
<instruction>Monitor the latest forecasts for updates on this situation.
Persons should delay all travel if possible. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution and be prepared for sudden
changes in visibility. Leave plenty of room between you and the
motorist ahead of you, and allow extra time to reach your
destination. Avoid sudden braking or acceleration, and be especially
cautious on hills or when making turns. Make sure your car is
winterized and in good working order.</instruction>
