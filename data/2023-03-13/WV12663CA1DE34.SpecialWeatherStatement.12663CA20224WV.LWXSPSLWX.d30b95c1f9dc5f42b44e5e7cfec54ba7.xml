<description>...HEAVY SNOW SHOWERS WILL AFFECT GARRETT...NORTHWESTERN GRANT AND
WEST CENTRAL MINERAL COUNTIES...
At 450 PM EDT, heavy snow showers were located along a line
extending from near Farmington to 8 miles northeast of Belington.
Movement was east at 25 mph.
Locations impacted include...
Mountain Lake Park, Oakland, Bayard, Bittinger, Grantsville, Loch
Lynn Heights, Friendsville, Deer Park, Accident, Elk Garden,
Kitzmiller, Franklin, Luke, Redhouse, Hutton, Gorman, Jennings, Deep
Creek Lake State Park, Crellin and Swallow Falls State Park.
This includes Interstate 68 in Maryland between mile markers 1 and
30.
Visibilities will drop quickly to less than a one-half of a mile in
these snow showers.
Use extra caution if you must travel into or through these dangerous
snow showers. Rapid changes in visibility and potentially slick
roads are likely to lead to accidents. Consider delaying travel
until the snow showers pass your location.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time when traveling.</description>
