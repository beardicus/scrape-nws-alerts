<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM TUESDAY TO 10 AM
AKDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Blowing snow expected. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.
Reduced visibilities to one half mile.
* WHERE...Kuskokwim Delta.
* WHEN...From 10 AM Tuesday to 10 AM AKDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel may be difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow and gusty westerly winds will develop
across the region this afternoon as a weather front moves into
the region. The snow is expected to taper off tonight; however,
northerly winds behind the front will increase overnight and
continue through Wednesday as colder air moves back over the
region. The gusty winds will result in widespread blowing snow,
resulting in significantly reduced visibilities, especially
through the day Tuesday. Conditions are expected to be worst
along the coast with visibilities reduced to as low as one half
mile. Inland areas, including Bethel, may experience periods of
reduced visibilities at times Tuesday night as well. Areas of
blowing snow may linger through Wednesday morning; however
visibility is expected to improve throughout the day.</description>
