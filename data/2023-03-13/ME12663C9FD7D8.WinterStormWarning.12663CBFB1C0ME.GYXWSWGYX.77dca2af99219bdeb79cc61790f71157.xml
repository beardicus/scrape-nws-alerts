<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 13 at 3:26AM EDT until March 15 at 12:00PM EDT by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...SIGNIFICANT WINTER STORM TONIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...
.Rapidly strengthening low pressure will approach southern New
England tonight, with snow overspreading the area through Tuesday
morning. Greatest snowfall will likely fall at higher terrain across
the Monadnocks, Sunapee, the Ossippees, and White Mountains. At
lower elevations, snow may be heavy and wet, resulting in possible
snow load impacts and power outages. Gusty northeast to north winds
Tuesday could accentuate power outage risk.
...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 5 AM TUESDAY TO NOON EDT
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 6 and
12 inches. Winds gusting as high as 50 mph, especially at the
coast.
* WHERE...Portions of southwest Maine. Portions of central and
southern New Hampshire.
* WHEN...From 5 AM Tuesday to Noon EDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Significant snowfall and periods of heavy snowfall rates
will combine with low visibility to create very dangerous driving
conditions. The hazardous conditions could impact the Tuesday
morning and evening commutes. The strong winds and weight of snow
on tree limbs may down power lines and could cause power outages.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Precipitation will likely start as rain near
the coast and across southern areas, and then transition to snow
later Monday night.</description>
