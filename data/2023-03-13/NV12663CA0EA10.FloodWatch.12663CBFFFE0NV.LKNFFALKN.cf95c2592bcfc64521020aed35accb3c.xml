<headline>Flood Watch issued March 13 at 7:28AM PDT until March 15 at 11:00AM PDT by NWS Elko</headline>
<description>.Widespread valley rain with elevated snow levels are expected to
renew the risk of flooding Tuesday into Wednesday, mostly in areas
below approximately 7000 feet. Areas of primary concern are small
creeks and streams, and areas with poor or obstructed drainage,
including areas impacted by flooding recently. Mainstem river
flooding is not currently expected but rivers will continue to rise
through midweek as snowmelt continues.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of eastern Nevada, north central Nevada,
northeast Nevada and south central Nevada, including the following
areas, in eastern Nevada, White Pine County. In north central
Nevada, Northern Lander County and Northern Eureka County and
Southern Lander County and Southern Eureka County. In northeast
Nevada, Northern Elko County, Ruby Mountains and East Humboldt
Range, South Central Elko County and Southwest Elko County. In
south central Nevada, Northeastern Nye County and Northwestern Nye
County.
* WHEN...From late tonight through Wednesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water
crossings may be flooded. Storm drains and ditches may become
clogged with debris.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A warm atmospheric river will lead to rapid runoff in
elevations below approximately 7000 feet. Although this
atmospheric river appears to be slightly cooler and maybe not
quite as wet as last Friday`s storm, runoff will respond more
rapidly due to primed low elevation snowpack, rising stream
and river flows, and saturated ground conditions. Expect
renewed flooding in areas that have just experienced flood
impacts. Significant river rises are expected although
mainstem river flooding is not currently forecast.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
