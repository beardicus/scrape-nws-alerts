- Large quantities of moisture are anticipated to move into the
region between Sunday night through Tuesday.  With snow
levels increasing above 5000 feet, there is an increased risk
of areal flooding in small creeks, streams and flood prone
areas. Some data sets show the 24 hour rain rates could be in
excess of 3 inches, which is fairly high for 24 hours in Mt.
Shasta City.  The Weather Prediction Center has also issued a
Moderate Risk for excessive rainfall for the watch area
Monday into Tuesday.
