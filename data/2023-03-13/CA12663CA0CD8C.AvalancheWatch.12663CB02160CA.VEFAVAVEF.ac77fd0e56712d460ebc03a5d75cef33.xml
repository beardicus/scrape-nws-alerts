<description>The Eastern Sierra Avalanche Center in Mammoth Lakes
has issued a Backcountry Avalanche Watch for the
following areas: the Eastern Sierra in Mono County and
the Eastern Sierra in Inyo County
* WHAT...Very dangerous avalanche conditions are expected to
develop at all elevations overnight tonight. Conditions are
expected to reach Warning levels by early morning on Tuesday,
March 14th.
* WHERE...The eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range
between Virgina Lakes on the north to Bishop Creek on the
south.
* WHEN...In effect until 7 AM PDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS..Intense snowfall, rain on snow at lower elevations, and
strong winds will overload the snowpack, which contains buried
persistent weak layers. Travel will be difficult and very
dangerous. Expect widespread areas of unstable snow.
* PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...Travel in avalanche
terrain is not recommended. Avalanches may run long distances,
into mature forests, valley floors or flat terrain.
