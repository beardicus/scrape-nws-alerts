<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 13 at 9:44PM EDT until March 15 at 8:00AM EDT by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...SIGNIFICANT WINTER STORM TONIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...
.Rapidly strengthening low pressure will approach southern New
England tonight, with snow overspreading the area through Tuesday
morning. Greatest snowfall will likely fall at higher terrain across
the Monadnocks, Sunapee, the Ossippees, and White Mountains. At
lower elevations, snow may be heavy and wet, resulting in possible
snow load impacts and power outages. Gusty northeast to north winds
Tuesday could accentuate power outage risk.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM EDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow. Additional snow accumulations between 5 and 11
inches for a storm total of 6 to 12 inches. Winds gusting as high
as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Northern Carroll, Northern Grafton, and Southern Grafton
Counties.
* WHEN...Until 8 AM EDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Significant snowfall and periods of heavy snowfall rates
may combine with low visibility to create very dangerous driving
conditions. The hazardous conditions could impact the Tuesday
morning and evening commutes. The strong winds and weight of snow
on tree limbs may down power lines and could cause sporadic power
outages.</description>
