<description>...Significant flow expected in the Whitewater River and the
Coachella Storm Water Channel by Wednesday afternoon...
Rain is forecast to develop over the San Bernardino Mountains and
northern portions of the Coachella Valley late Tuesday morning
and become heavy Tuesday night through Wednesday morning. A high
freezing level will allow most of the precipitation to fall as
rain. In addition to rain, snowmelt will continue and run off
into the Whitewater River wash. Rainfall of 2 to 5 inches likely
on the mountain slopes by Thursday...with 1 to 2 inches possible
in the lower elevations, including in the San Gorgonio Pass.
As runoff accelerates off the San Bernardino Mountains...significant
flows will develop in the Whitewater River. These flows are
forecast to reach Palm Springs midday Wednesday...and flow
southward through the Coachella Valley to Indio and beyond during
the afternoon. The flow will impact low-water crossings and may
create dangerous swiftwater areas through the valley.
The rain will diminish Wednesday evening...but some flow will
likely continue in the canal through Thursday. Residents should
be prepared for road closures and listen for later advisories.</description>
