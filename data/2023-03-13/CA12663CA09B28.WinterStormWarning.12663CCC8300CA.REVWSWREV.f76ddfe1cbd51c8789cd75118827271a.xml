<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM PDT
WEDNESDAY...
* CHANGES...Lesser lower elevation snow amounts Tuesday and
Wednesday.
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Additional snow accumulations
through Monday: Up to 3 inches at lake level and around Truckee,
with 8 to 16 inches above 7000 feet. For Tuesday into Wednesday,
accumulations of 2 to 6 inches at lake level and Truckee, with

feet through Monday evening, then rise between 7000 and 7500
feet Tuesday morning, before falling during the afternoon to
below 6000 feet by late Tuesday night. The heaviest overall
snowfall rates are expected on Tuesday. Isolated lightning is
also possible during heavier snow.</description>
