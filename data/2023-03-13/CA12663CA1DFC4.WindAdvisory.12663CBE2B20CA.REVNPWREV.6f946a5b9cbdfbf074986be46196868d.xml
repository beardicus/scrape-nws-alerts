<headline>Wind Advisory issued March 13 at 1:57PM PDT until March 14 at 11:00PM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WIND ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM TO 11 PM PDT TUESDAY...
* CHANGES...Replaces High Wind Watch.
* WHAT...South winds 20 to 35 mph with gusts up to 50 mph
expected. Wind prone areas including US-395 north of Reno, I-580
from south Reno to Carson City and US-95 near Walker Lake could
see gusts above 60 mph. Waves 2 to 4 feet on Pyramid Lake.
* WHERE...Mineral and Southern Lyon Counties, Surprise Valley
California, Greater Reno-Carson City-Minden Area, Western
Nevada Basin and Range including Pyramid Lake and Northern
Washoe County.
* WHEN...From 8 AM to 11 PM PDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Gusty winds could blow down tree limbs and a few
power outages may result. Travel will be difficult, especially
for high profile vehicles. Lake waters will be rough and small
boats, kayaks and paddle boards will be prone to capsizing.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Periods of heavy rain and high elevation
snow are also expected. This may act to weaken wind speeds at
times, but stronger wind gusts remain possible near stronger
shower bands and after larger rain areas diminish or move out.</description>
<instruction>Now is the time to secure loose outdoor items such as patio
furniture and trash cans before winds increase which could blow
these items away. The best thing to do is prepare ahead of time by
making sure you have extra food and water on hand, flashlights
with spare batteries and/or candles in the event of a power
outage.</instruction>
