<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 13 at 2:46PM PDT until March 15 at 5:00PM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM PDT
WEDNESDAY...
* CHANGES...Updated to remove the Monday wording for snow levels
and amounts. Slightly higher snow levels Tuesday.
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Additional snow accumulations of 2
to 6 inches below 7000 feet down to lake level and Truckee,
with 1 to 3 feet above 7000 feet. Sierra ridge gusts above 100
mph and wave heights 2 to 4 feet on Lake Tahoe.
* WHERE...Greater Lake Tahoe Area.
* WHEN...Until 5 PM PDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be very difficult to impossible with
snowfall rates 2 to 3 inches per hour at times. Snow loading on
structures will increase due to the additional rain and snow
being absorbed into the deep snowpack, along with higher risks
for dangerous roofalanches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow levels will rise to near 8000 feet
Tuesday morning, before falling during the late afternoon to
below 6000 feet by late Tuesday night. Isolated lightning is
also possible during heavier snow.</description>
<instruction>Avoid travel if possible, you could be stuck in your vehicle for
many hours. If you must travel, prepare for long delays and carry
an emergency kit with extra food, water and clothing. If you stay
home, have a backup plan in case of power outages.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
