<headline>Flood Watch issued March 13 at 8:06PM PDT until March 15 at 5:00AM PDT by NWS SanDiego</headline>
<description>.Heavy rain may fall on a deep primed snowpack leading to the melt
increasing. Flows in rivers may increase quickly and reach critical
levels.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH WEDNESDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of Southwest California, including the following
areas, Orange County Coastal Areas, Orange County Inland Areas,
San Bernardino and Riverside County Valleys-The Inland Empire and
Santa Ana Mountains and Foothills.
* WHEN...From Tuesday afternoon through Wednesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water
crossings may be flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A  Pacific storm system, fed by elevated moisture from an
Atmospheric River, will spread widespread moderate to heavy
rainfall across the area. Several additional inches of
rainfall on already saturated soils, will likely produce
rapid runoff, resulting in local flooding at time of peak
rainfall rates.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
