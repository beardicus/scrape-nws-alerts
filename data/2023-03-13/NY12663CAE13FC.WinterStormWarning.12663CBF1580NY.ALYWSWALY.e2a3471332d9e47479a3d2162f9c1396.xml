<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM EDT
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy, wet snow expected. Total snow accumulations of
12 to 18 inches with greater amounts up to 26 inches in the
higher terrain areas of the southern Greens and into the
northern Berkshires. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Southern Vermont, western Massachusetts, northern
Litchfield Hills and the northern and central Taconics in
eastern New York.
* WHEN...From 5 PM Monday to 8 AM EDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be very difficult to impossible,
including the Tuesday morning and evening commutes. The weight
of the heavy wet snow on tree branches will likely result in
power outages. Snowfall rates will reach 1 to 2 inches per
hour at times with locally higher rates possible depending on
where the heaviest snow bands develop. Strong winds will also
result in very low visibility, especially Tuesday into Tuesday
night.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...This will be a long duration and high-
impact snow event.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.</instruction>
