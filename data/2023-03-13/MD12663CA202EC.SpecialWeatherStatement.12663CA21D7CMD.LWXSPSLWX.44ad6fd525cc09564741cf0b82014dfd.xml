<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WILL AFFECT GARRETT COUNTY...
At 546 PM EDT, a snow squall was located near Bittinger, moving east
at 30 mph.
Locations impacted include...
Mountain Lake Park, Oakland, Bayard, Bittinger, Grantsville, Loch
Lynn Heights, Deer Park, Accident, Redhouse, Gorman, Jennings, Deep
Creek Lake State Park, Crellin, Swallow Falls State Park, McHenry,
Big Run State Park, Piney Grove, McComas Beach, Merrill and Keysers
Ridge.
This includes Interstate 68 in Maryland between mile markers 6 and
30.
Visibilities will drop quickly to less than a quarter of a mile in
this squall.
Use extra caution if you must travel into or through this snow
squall. Rapid changes in visibility and potentially slick roads are
likely to lead to accidents. Consider delaying travel until the
squall passes your location.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time when traveling.</description>
