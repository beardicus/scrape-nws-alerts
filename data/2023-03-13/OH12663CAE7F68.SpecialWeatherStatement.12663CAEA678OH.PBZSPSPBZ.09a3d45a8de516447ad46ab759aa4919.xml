ALLEGHENY...WEST CENTRAL ARMSTRONG...SOUTHWESTERN CLARION AND
HANCOCK COUNTIES...
At 1129 PM EDT, an isolated band of snow was located near Slippery
Rock to near New Cumberland. Movement was southeast at 25 mph.
Locations impacted include...
Ross Township, McCandless Township, Cranberry, Moon Township,
Weirton, Butler, Franklin Park, East Liverpool, Aliquippa, Beaver
Falls, Monaca, and Wellsville.
This includes the following highways...
Pennsylvania Turnpike between mile markers 6 and 40.
Interstate 79 in Pennsylvania between mile markers 63 and 109.
Parkway North between mile markers 8 and 13.
Interstate 376 in Pennsylvania between mile markers 21 and 60.
Snow will lead to reduced visibilities and hazardous travel
conditions.
Use extra caution if you must travel into or through this intense
snow band. Rapid changes in visibility and potentially slick roads
are likely to lead to accidents. Consider delaying travel until the
band passes your location.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time when traveling.</description>
