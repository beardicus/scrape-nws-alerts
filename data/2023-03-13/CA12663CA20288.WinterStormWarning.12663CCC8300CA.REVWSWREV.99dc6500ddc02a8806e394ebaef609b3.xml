<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 13 at 2:46PM PDT until March 15 at 5:00PM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM PDT
WEDNESDAY...
* CHANGES...Updated to remove the Monday wording for snow levels
and amounts. Slightly higher snow levels Tuesday.
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Additional snow accumulations 2 to 6
inches for communities along US-395 including Bridgeport and Lee
Vining, with 1 to 2 feet around June Lake and Mammoth Lakes and
2 to 4 feet along the crest above 8500 feet. Sierra ridge gusts
above 100 mph.
* WHERE...Mono County.
* WHEN...Until 5 PM PDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be very difficult to impossible with
snowfall rates 2 to 3 inches per hour at times. Snow loading on
structures will increase due to the additional rain and snow
being absorbed into the deep snowpack, along with higher risks
for dangerous roofalanches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow levels will rise between 8000 to 8500
feet on Tuesday, before falling Tuesday night to below 6000 feet
by early Wednesday morning. Isolated lightning is also possible
during heavier snow.</description>
