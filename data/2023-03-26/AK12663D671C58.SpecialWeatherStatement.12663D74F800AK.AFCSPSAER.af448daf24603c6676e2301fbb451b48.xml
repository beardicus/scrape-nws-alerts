<description>...THE CHUGACH NATIONAL FOREST AVALANCHE CENTER HAS ISSUED A SPECIAL
AVALANCHE BULLETIN...
SPECIAL AVALANCHE BULLETIN
BROADCAST REQUESTED
6:00am Sunday, March 26, 2023
The Chugach NF Avalanche Information Center in Girdwood has
issued a SPECIAL AVALANCHE BULLETIN for the following areas:
Girdwood, Portage, Turnagain Pass, Moose Pass, Summit Lake, and
Seward
* WHAT...Dangerous avalanche conditions exist in the backcountry. Avalanche
danger is CONSIDERABLE.
* WHERE...For Turnagain Pass and the Kenai and Western Chugach
Mountains in and around Eastern Turnagain Arm.
* WHEN...In effect from Sunday 6:00am to Sunday 8:00pm AKST.
* IMPACTS...Very large human-triggered avalanches are likely.
Despite clear skies and nicer weather, the snowpack is very
unstable and dangerous avalanches can be easily triggered by
people. It is likely avalanches may be triggered remotely from
flat terrain below steeper slopes.
* PRECAUTIONARY / PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS... If deciding to recreate
in the backcountry, choose terrain that is flat or less than 30
degrees in steepness, with nothing steeper above you. Cautious
route-finding and conservative decision-making skills will be
necessary to identify and avoid slopes that could avalanche.
Similar avalanche danger may exist at locations outside the
coverage area of this or any avalanche center.</description>
