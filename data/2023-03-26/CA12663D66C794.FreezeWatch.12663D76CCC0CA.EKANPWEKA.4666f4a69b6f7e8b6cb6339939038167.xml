<instruction>Monitor the latest forecasts and warnings for updates on this
situation. Fasten loose objects or shelter objects in a safe
location prior to the onset of winds.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.
Frost Advisories and Freeze Warnings are issued during the local
growing season as defined by climatology and local agriculture
experts. Once the growing season has ended these statements will
no longer be issued until the spring.</instruction>
