<description>...SNOW SHOWERS DIMINISHING TODAY WITH ANOTHER WINTER STORM
LATE MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY...
* Snow showers continue across the Basin and Range southward into
Mineral and southern Lyon counties. Webcams indicate that roads
are mainly wet, however, visibility has been below 1 mile at
times in heavier bands. Motorists along Highway 95 through
Hawthorne and Mina should prepare for rapidly changing
visibility in snow and fog. Other snow showers will bring brief
periods of snow and lower visibility along Highway 50 east of
Fallon this afternoon. Snow showers are expected to diminish in
areal coverage later this afternoon and evening.
* A stronger winter storm is likely to impact the region late
Monday night through Wednesday, with the best chances for heavy
Sierra snowfall from late Monday night through Tuesday evening.
This will be a cold storm with snow levels close to the lower
valley floors. Precipitation will be showery into western
Nevada with best chances for spillover Tuesday.
* Snow totals in the High Sierra could reach 2 to 3 feet, with 8
to 18 inches for the Tahoe Basin, around Mammoth Lakes, and
mountainous areas of northeast CA west of US-395. Snow totals on
valley floors of western Nevada could reach up to 2 inches, with
2 to 4 inches possible for foothill locations and Virginia
City. The late March sun angle will limit accumulations on most
road surfaces in lower elevations.
* For Monday night through Tuesday evening: Gusty south to
southwest winds will accompany the main cold front. This will
bring areas of blowing and drifting snow, further reducing
visibility and bringing significant travel disruptions in the
Sierra. Wind gusts to 40 to 50 mph in valley locations and over
100 mph along Sierra ridges may also bring difficulties for
high profile vehicles, aviation interests, and backcountry
recreation.</description>
