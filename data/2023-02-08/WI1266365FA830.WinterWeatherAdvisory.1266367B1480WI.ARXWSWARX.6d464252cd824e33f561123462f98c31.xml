<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued February 08 at 2:28PM CST until February 09 at 6:00PM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...A Band of Mixed Precipitation and Heavy Snow Likely...
.A storm system spreads from south to north late tonight and
early Thursday morning across northeast Iowa and southwest
Wisconsin. A mixture of snow, rain, and freezing rain may occur
early in the morning before transitioning to all snow by mid-
morning. As temperatures warm in the afternoon, the snow may mix
with rain before coming to an end in the late afternoon. The snow
that falls will be heavy in nature with rates of over 1 inch per
hour at times. This forecast has been fluctuating over the last 24
hours and may continue to shift slightly overnight, so it is
advised to pay close attention to the forecast.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM TO 6 PM CST
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow accumulations of
1 to 4 inches and ice accumulations of a light glaze.
* WHERE...In Iowa, Fayette County. In Wisconsin, Richland County.
* WHEN...The best potential for a mix of snow and freezing rain
will be early in the morning, transitioning to snow by mid-
morning and the possibly a rain and snow mix in the afternoon
before ending.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...There still remains some degree of
uncertainty in how much freezing rain and rain will mix with
the snow, which could quickly impact snowfall amounts.</description>
