<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued February 08 at 5:06AM AKST until February 10 at 1:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
FRIDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions possible. Total snow accumulations of
2 to 6 inches possible. Winds could gust as high as 70 mph.
* WHERE...Pribilof Islands.
* WHEN...From Thursday afternoon through Friday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. Very strong winds
could damage property and cause power outages.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...There is high confidence that strong winds
will persist from Thursday afternoon through Friday. There is
moderate but increasing confidence that steady snow will fall
during this period, leading to significantly reduced visibility
in blowing snow. St. George Island is expected to see stronger
winds, higher snow amounts, and a longer duration of blowing
snow than St. Paul Island.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Watch for blizzard conditions means there is a
potential for falling and/or blowing snow with strong winds and
extremely poor visibilities. This can lead to whiteout conditions
and make travel very hazardous.</instruction>
