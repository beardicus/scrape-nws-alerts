<description>...Heavy Snow Thursday For Northeast IA, southwest WI...

northeast Iowa and southwest Wisconsin overnight, transitioning to
all snow early Thursday morning. Heavy wet snow will then fall
for most of the morning hours, shifting east northeast in the
afternoon.
The storm has slowed up a bit, and shifted more southeast in it`s
track...and thus the heavy snow band has shifted more southeast
too. The higher amounts and impacts will still be confined to
northeast Iowa and southwest Wisconsin.
