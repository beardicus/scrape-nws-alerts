all the water from these storms to work through local drainage
systems in urban areas.

indicated heavy rain due to thunderstorms. Flooding is
already occurring in the warned area. Between 2 and 6 inches
of rain have fallen.

the warned area.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Batesville, Newport, Heber Springs, Pocahontas, Walnut Ridge,
Cherokee Village, Hoxie, Mountain View, Melbourne, Salem in
Fulton County, Ash Flat, Black Rock, Lake Charles State Park,
Horseshoe Bend, Cave City, Tuckerman, Diaz, Newark, Highland
in Sharp County and Mammoth Spring.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
