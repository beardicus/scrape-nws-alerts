<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 AM TO 7 PM AKST
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Northeast winds 35 to 55 mph with gusts up to 75 mph
expected.
* WHERE...Central Aleutians.
* WHEN...From 7 AM to 7 PM AKST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...High winds may move loose debris, damage property,
and cause power outages. Travel will be difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Peak winds are expected late Thursday
morning through Thursday afternoon. Significant reductions in
visibility are possible in blowing snow. However, temperatures
will warm above freezing and result in wet snow that will not
easily become lofted by winds. There remains some uncertainty
regarding how quickly snow will transition to rain or a rain
snow mix.</description>
<instruction>People are urged to secure loose objects that could be blown
around or damaged by the wind. Prepare for the possibility of
widespread power outages. Use caution if you must travel.</instruction>
