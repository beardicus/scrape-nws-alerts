<description>...A Band of Wet Accumulating Snow Likely...
.A winter system is still expected to bring accumulating heavy,
wet snow to a portion of the area late tonight into Thursday.
Recent trends have shifted the storm track a bit further south
and east, resulting in lower confidence in where the accompanying
band of heaviest snow will fall and how much is to be expected.
The highest snow rates are still anticipated Thursday morning
between daybreak and noon across northeast Iowa and southwest
Wisconsin. Pay close attention to the forecast if you have travel
plans Thursday.

THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 2 to 4
inches.
* WHERE...Portions of northeast Iowa and central, southwest and
west central Wisconsin.
* WHEN...From 3 AM to 6 PM CST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The snow band may still shift further south
and changes to the areas under the advisory are still possible.</description>
