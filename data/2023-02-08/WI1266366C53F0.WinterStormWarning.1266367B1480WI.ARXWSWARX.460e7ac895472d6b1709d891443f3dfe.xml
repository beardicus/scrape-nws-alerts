<description>...Heavy Snow Thursday For Northeast IA, southwest WI...
.A winter storm will push rain to a wintry mix across parts of
northeast Iowa and southwest Wisconsin overnight, transitioning to
all snow early Thursday morning. Heavy wet snow will then fall
for most of the morning hours, shifting east northeast in the
afternoon.
The storm has slowed up a bit, and shifted more southeast in it`s
track...and thus the heavy snow band has shifted more southeast
too. The higher amounts and impacts will still be confined to
northeast Iowa and southwest Wisconsin.

THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Snow with accumulations from 3 to 6 inches. Locally
higher amounts possible. A wintry mix possible at onset. Winds
gusting as high as 35 mph.

* WHEN...From 3 AM to 6 PM CST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
