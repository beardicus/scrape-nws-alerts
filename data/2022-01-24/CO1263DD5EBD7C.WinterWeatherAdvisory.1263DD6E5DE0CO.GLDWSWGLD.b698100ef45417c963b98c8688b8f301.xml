<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 24 at 8:59PM MST until January 25 at 11:00PM MST by NWS Goodland</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM MST
/MIDNIGHT CST/ TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Moderate to heavy snow expected. Total snow
accumulations of 3 to 7 inches.
* WHERE...Entire Tri-State area.
* WHEN...From 11 PM MST /midnight CST/ this evening to 11 PM MST
/midnight CST/ Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous travel conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Light snow will develop in northeast
Colorado and southwest Nebraska overnight, expanding south and
east to Interstate 70 by sunrise. The heaviest snow, and
majority of snow accumulation, is anticipated to occur between
sunrise and noon. Snow will gradually taper off from north to
south during the afternoon and evening. Accumulations reaching
or exceeding 6 inches are possible across portions of the
Interstate 70 corridor in northwest Kansas, where a narrow band
of heavy snow may develop late Tuesday morning. Considerable
uncertainty persists with regard to where exactly this band of
heavy snow will occur. Total snow accumulations may vary
considerably from county to county.</description>
<instruction>Travel conditions may rapidly deteriorate along the Interstate 70
corridor Tuesday morning. If you must travel, slow down, turn off
cruise control, and exercise additional caution, particularly at
intersections and highway on-ramps and off-ramps where accidents
are more likely to occur. Decelerating abruptly or making sharp
turns at a high rate of speed may result in loss of vehicle
control.
The latest road conditions for the state you are calling from can
be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
