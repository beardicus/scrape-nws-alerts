<description>...LIGHT SNOW AHEAD FOR THE PANHANDLES...
An upper level winter system is expected to track from
southeastern Utah tomorrow afternoon to across the southern Texas
Panhandle Wednesday.
Light snow is expected to develop across the Oklahoma Panhandle
late Tuesday afternoon. The light snow will then shift south through
remainder of the Panhandles Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning.
Some snow may potentially hang on into the early afternoon in the
southeastern Texas Panhandle. Light snowfall accumulations around
one to two inches is expected across most of the Panhandles, but
there could be a corridor of three to four inches in the southwest
Texas Panhandle.
The snowfall may reduce visibilities at times and may cause snow-
packed and icy roads. With precipitation chances in the 60 to 80
percent range early Wednesday morning, there`s a decent chance that
the Wednesday morning commute will be impacted by snow, at least for
the central and western Panhandles. Still can`t rule out some impacts
to the eastern Panhandles Wednesday morning, but the chances are
certainly not as high as the central and western Panhandles.
Stay tuned to the developments of this winter system by visiting
