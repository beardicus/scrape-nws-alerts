        <description>...INCOMING STORM WILL BRING HEAVY SNOW TO THE NORTHERN
PANHANDLE HIGHWAYS...

.A low pressure system moving northward will bring heavy snow to the
northern panhandle Saturday night through Sunday. Forecast
confidence remains high of significant snow accumulations along the
Klondike Highway and Haines Highway, including White Pass and Haines
Customs. However, forecast confidence is much lower for snow
accumulations at sea-level, particularly for the towns of Haines and
Skagway. As the low moves north, northerly flow, will usher in
cooler air and support snow, however as the low tracks north, there
will be a southerly push of wind that will ultimately switch the
snow to rain. The forecast challenge is the track of the low
pressure and timing of wind change, which will cause significant
variability in snowfall accumulations for Haines and Skagway at sea-
level. By Sunday afternoon, snowfall rates will diminish as the
system begins to depart, and its southerly push of warmer air
arrives in the northern panhandle.

* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 7 to 10
inches near Haines Customs, and 3-7 inches near Haines.

* WHERE...Haines Highway.

* WHEN...From midnight tonight to 3 PM AKST Sunday.

* IMPACTS...Travel will be very difficult.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Forecast confidence is high in significant
accumulating snowfall along the Haines Highway, with totals of
up to 10 inches expected. Forecast challenge for this system
remains the amount of snowfall that will reach the surface at
sea-level. Forecast confidence is low for snowfall totals closer
to sea level and for the city of Haines itself. Warmer
temperatures will likely cap snowfall totals near sea- level to
3-7 inches. However, there is the potential that temperatures
will be too warm for anything more than minor accumulating
snowfall for the city of Haines itself. Alternatively, heavy
snowfall could cause cooling in the lower levels, creating and
enhancing snowfall, leading to significantly higher totals for
the city of Haines, approaching similar totals to those along
the Haines Highway.
