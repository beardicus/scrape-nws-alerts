<headline>Special Weather Statement issued August 21 at 4:25AM AKDT  by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...MENDENHALL RIVER HAS CRESTED...
THE MENDENHALL RIVER AND LAKE HAVE CRESTED AND WATER LEVELS HAVE
BEGUN TO DROP. AS OF 415 AM MONDAY MORNING, THE MENDENHALL LAKE GAGE
WAS AT 6.95 FEET AND DIMINISHING. A CREST HEIGHT OF 7.7 FEET WAS
OBSERVED AT 1 AM AKDT MONDAY, AUGUST 21. THIS IS BELOW THE FLOOD
STAGE OF 9.0 FEET. WATER LEVELS IN THE BASIN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE
CURRENT RELEASE WERE ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT A QUARTER AS HIGH AS WHAT
WAS OBSERVED AT THE START OF THE PRIMARY RELEASE EARLIER THIS MONTH.
WE DO NOT KNOW IF ALL THE WATER IN THE BASIN WILL RELEASE, NOR
EXACTLY HOW MUCH WATER REMAINS IN THE BASIN. CONSEQUENTLY, THE EXACT
TIMING AND SPEED OF THE DROP IN WATER LEVEL MAY VARY FROM THE
FORECAST. THE RIVER WILL CONTINUE TO BE MONITORED, IN THE EVENT THAT
MORE WATER RELEASES FROM THE BASIN.</description>
