<headline>Special Weather Statement issued August 21 at 10:10PM MDT  by NWS Saltlake</headline>
<description>...Strong thunderstorms will impact portions of southwestern San Juan
and central Kane Counties through 1100 PM MDT...
At 1008 PM MDT, Doppler radar was tracking strong thunderstorms along
a line extending from near NMS Beach to near Paria Canyon. Movement
was north at 45 mph.
HAZARD...Wind gusts up to 50 mph.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around
unsecured objects.
Locations impacted include...
Big Water, Lake Powell, Paria River Slot Canyon, The Wave, Paria
Canyon and Stateline Wash Slot Canyon.
This storm will be capable of producing strong gusty winds on Lake
Powell. This will lead to a sudden increase in waves and very choppy
waters which will result in hazardous boating conditions. Boaters are
urged to seek safe harbor if possible.
This includes US Route 89 between mile markers 1 and 35.
MAX HAIL SIZE...0.00 IN
MAX WIND GUST...50 MPH</description>
<instruction>If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.
Frequent cloud to ground lightning is occurring with these storms.
Lightning can strike 10 miles away from a thunderstorm. Seek a safe
shelter inside a building or vehicle.
If on or near Lake Powell west of Dangling Rope Marina, get out of
the water and move indoors or inside a vehicle. Remember, lightning
can strike out to 10 miles from the parent thunderstorm. If you can
hear thunder, you are close enough to be struck by lightning. Move
to safe shelter now! Do not be caught on the water in a thunderstorm.</instruction>
