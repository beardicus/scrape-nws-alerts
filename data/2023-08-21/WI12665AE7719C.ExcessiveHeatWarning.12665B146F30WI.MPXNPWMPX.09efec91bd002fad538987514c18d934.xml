<description>...EXCESSIVE HEAT WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM TUESDAY TO 10 PM
CDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Dangerously hot conditions over multiple days. The

heat index values up to 108 expected.
* WHERE...Chippewa County.
* WHEN...From 11 AM Tuesday to 10 PM CDT Wednesday.

<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles

Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
