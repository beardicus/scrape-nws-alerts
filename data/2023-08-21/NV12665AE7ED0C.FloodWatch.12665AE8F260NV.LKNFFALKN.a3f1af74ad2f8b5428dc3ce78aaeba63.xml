<headline>Flood Watch issued August 21 at 4:31AM PDT  by NWS Elko</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall and localized heavy
rainfall from thunderstorms is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of north central, northeast, and northwest
Nevada, including the following areas, in north central Nevada,
Northern Lander County and Northern Eureka County. In northeast
Nevada, Northern Elko County, South Central Elko County,
Southeastern Elko County and Southwest Elko County. In northwest
Nevada, Humboldt County.
* WHEN...Through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poorly drained areas and urban areas.
Low-water crossings may be flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Deep Tropical moisture is forecast to move northward into
portions of northern Nye County, Southern Lander and Eureka
Counties, White Pine counties and southern Elko County mainly
affecting the Ruby Mountains starting late on Saturday
lasting at least through Monday morning. The moisture,
atmospheric instability, and weak lift associated with the
decaying remnants of Hilary will aid in the potential for
moderate to heavy rainfall and the potential of localized
heavy rainfall from thunderstorms that could lead to flash
flooding.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
