Island, Coastal Cameron, Coastal Kenedy, Coastal Willacy,
Inland Kenedy, Inland Willacy, Kenedy Island, Northern Hidalgo,
and Willacy Island

SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
At 10 PM CDT, Tropical Depression 9 continues to
track steadily westward across the Western Gulf of Mexico towards the
lower Texas coast. The depression has continued to slowly strengthen
and is forecast to reach Tropical Storm strength early Tuesday morning
before making landfall along the lower Texas coast between mid-
morning and Noon Tuesday. Tropical Storm conditions will be possible
across the Islands, coastal Cameron and into Willacy, Kenedy, Brooks
and portions of northern Hidalgo counties early Tuesday morning. Heavy
rainfall and gusty winds will also be increasing in coverage and
intensity towards morning as rain bands approach the lower coast.
Isolated tornadoes, especially north of where the center of the
depression crosses the coast are possible. Minor coastal flooding or
run-up to the dunes is possible, especially around high tide at 5:38
AM Tuesday.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible
significant impacts across The Rio Grande Valley and Deep South
Texas. Potential impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Arroyos and larger creeks may quickly become swollen with swift
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals, and
ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
all coastal zones into inland Willacy and inland Kenedy counties.
Potential impacts in this area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across The Rio Grande Valley and Deep South Texas, little
to no impact is anticipated.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts
across the northern Ranchlands. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
Elsewhere across The Rio Grande Valley and Deep South Texas, little
to no impact is anticipated.
* SURGE:
Protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across the lower Texas coast. Potential impacts in this area
include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of near-shore roads and exposed parking lots could
become covered with some surge water. Driving conditions
dangerous in places where surge water covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.
- Minor damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. A few
small craft broken away from moorings.
Elsewhere across The Rio Grande Valley and Deep South Texas, little
to no impact is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
Keep cell phones well charged. Cell phone chargers for automobiles
can be helpful, but be aware of your risk for deadly carbon monoxide
poisoning if your car is left idling in a garage or other poorly
ventilated area.
If you are a visitor, be sure to know the name of the city or town in
which you are staying and the name of the county in which it resides.
Listen for these locations in local news updates. Pay attention for
instructions from local authorities.
Rapidly rising flood waters are deadly. If you are in a flood-prone
area, consider moving to higher ground. Never drive through a flooded
roadway. Remember, turn around don`t drown!
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
