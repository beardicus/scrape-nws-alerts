EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding of
2 to 3 ft MHHW expected, especially around high tide, which
occurs at 5:38am Tuesday. For the High Surf Advisory, large
breaking waves of 4 to 7 feet expected in the surf zone. For the

Counties.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 7 PM this evening

CDT this evening through Tuesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding is expected, with water reaching
or pushing into the dunes on South Padre Island. Vehicles,
except those with four wheel drive and high wheel bases, will
be unable to be driven on the beach. This includes locations
north of Public Beach Access #3. Minor beach erosion is
expected, mainly on Padre Island National Seashore. Dangerous
swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach erosion.
Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore
into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Tropical Depression Nine, which is forecast
to become a tropical storm, will produce hazardous beach
conditions as it approaches and makes landfall on the Lower
Texas coast.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
If caught in a rip current, relax and float. Don`t swim against
the current. If able, swim in a direction following the shoreline.
If unable to escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
