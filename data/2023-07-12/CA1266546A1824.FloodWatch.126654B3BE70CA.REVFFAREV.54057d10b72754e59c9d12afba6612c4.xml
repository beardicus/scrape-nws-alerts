<headline>Flood Watch issued July 12 at 1:33PM PDT until July 16 at 8:00PM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>.Record and near record high temperatures over the weekend will
accelerate snowmelt in the Eastern Sierra in Mono County leading to
increasing streamflows and renewed flooding concerns. The highest
flows are expected Friday night through Monday morning.
...FLOOD WATCH FOR SNOWMELT IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY EVENING THROUGH
MONDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Additional flooding caused by snowmelt.
* WHERE...Mono County in east central California.
* WHEN...From Friday evening through Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff from snowmelt may result in flooding of
rivers, creeks, streams. Particularly those that drain higher
elevations of the Eastern Sierra.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- An incoming heatwave across the Southwest will bring near or
record breaking heat this weekend. Consequently, another
round of snowmelt runoff will produce dangerous flows on
creaks and streams that drain out of the high Sierra.

streams and have a backup plan. Stream crossings may be hazardous,
