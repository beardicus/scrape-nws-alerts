<description>...High Water Continuing This Week Between The Colville
and Sag Rivers...
The Sag and Kuparuk Rivers have fallen below bankfull and flood
advisories for those locations have now been cancelled.
Another inch of rain falling over the North Slope Tuesday night
into today between the Colville and Sag Rivers will cause most
streams and small rivers between the Colville and Sag Rivers to
rise to near bankfull today and tonight. Areas with ponded water
will likely expand today.
Larger rivers such as the Colville, Kuparuk and Sag will rise
back to near bankfull Thursday and Friday. No river flooding is
expected, but people along rivers in this area should be alert to
rising water levels.</description>
