<description>.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 411 AM CDT Tue Mar 15 2022
Southwesterly winds will be bringing warm and very dry air into the
region this afternoon. While the driest air and strongest winds are
displaced in time and space, relative humidity values in the mid
teens to lower 20s combined with gusts 25-30 mph will create high to
extreme fire weather conditions. Timing of most concern will be from
4-6 pm as this is when the surface winds are most aligned in
direction with the winds aloft, and is when winds could overperform
compared to what is currently expected. As we approach sunset wind
speeds will decrease for a couple hours as the boundary layer
stabilizes, though they will likely increase again overnight as a
low pressure system moves towards the region.
People are urged to exercise extreme care with respect to outdoor
activities that could cause grass fires. Avoid equipment that can
cause sparks near dry grass or brush. Do not toss cigarettes on
the ground. Report new fires quickly to the nearest fire
department or law enforcement office.
...EXTREME FIRE DANGER...
The Grassland Fire Danger Index will reach the extreme category
this afternoon. Extreme weather conditions and very low
moisture content of grasses, and other dry organic material
on the ground, indicate that critical burning conditions exist.
All fires have the potential to become large and spread quickly,
becoming erratic with extreme behavioral characteristics.
No outdoor burning should take place.
OUTLOOK FOR WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...The Grassland Fire Danger Index
will reach the high category.
The grassland fire danger product reflects fire danger for native
grasses. It is not intended for cured agricultural crops, nor
will it reflect conditions in road ditches which have been mowed.</description>
