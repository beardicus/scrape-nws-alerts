<description>...Breezy with Rain Showers and Mountain Snow This Morning
Followed By Another Storm System Moving Through This Weekend...
* Wind: Gusty west-southwest winds will occur tonight into Tuesday
with gusts on the order of 25-30 MPH for most areas. While not a
significant wind scenario, wind prone areas such as Washoe
Valley and the Eastern Sierra along Highway 395 could see gusts
over 40 MPH which may result in tricky travel for high profile
vehicles. Sierra ridges will gust to 60-80 MPH which may impact
morning ski operations. Choppy water should be expected on Lake
Tahoe and Pyramid Lake through the day.
* Snow: As this is a warmer and quick moving storm, accumulating
snowfall through this morning will be confined to the Sierra
passes, mainly above 7000 feet including Donner, Mt Rose, Echo,
and Carson. Snowfall amounts of 1-3 inches are possible at this
pass levels, which could result in slick roads and temporary
chain controls. Locally higher amounts are possible in higher
terrain along the Sierra crest. Much of the Eastern Sierra
south of Bridgeport will see only limited light snowfall
confined to near the Sierra crest.
* Rain: A wet commute should be planned for Tuesday morning,
especially across Northeast California including Susanville and
Western Nevada including Reno and Carson City and Fernley. While
not a big rainfall, with amounts around a tenth to maybe a
quarter of an inch possible, wet roadways can lead to slowdowns
during busier travel periods. Most of the precipitation should
be out of the area by early afternoon.
* After a warm and dry remainder of the work week, a cooler system
with the potential of gusty winds and more widespread wintry
conditions are possible this upcoming weekend. Stay tuned for
future updates and plan accordingly - especially if planning
travel into the Sierra on Saturday or Sunday.</description>
