<headline>Red Flag Warning issued August 01 at 1:10PM PDT until August 02 at 11:00PM PDT by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...Abundant Lightning On Dry Fuels Expected through Tuesday...
.While cloud cover and showers along and near Cascades this
morning will limit the potential for thunderstorm development in
that area for much of the afternoon, areas west and east of that
cloud cover are likely to see thunderstorms develop this afternoon.
This evening through early Tuesday morning an upper level impulse
moving northward from the San Francisco Bay area is expected to
increase shower and thunderstorm coverage across the forecast area,
to include some areas west of the Cascades. After a brief lull
late Tuesday morning into early Tuesday afternoon, a new round of
scattered showers and thunderstorms is expected to develop from
western Siskiyou County, Josephine County, and eastern Douglas
County eastward. Abundant lightning, gusty outflow winds, and
locally heavy rainfall are all possible with the thunderstorms.
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM PDT TUESDAY FOR ABUNDANT
LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONE 282...
The National Weather Service in Medford has issued a Red Flag
Warning...which is in effect until 11 PM PDT Tuesday.
* Impacts: Abundant lightning on critically dry vegetation is
likely to result in numerous new fire starts this afternoon
through Tuesday evening that could overwhelm firefighting
resources. Gusty thunderstorm outflow wind gusts of 30 to 60 mph
will contribute to fire spread in some areas. In other areas,
locally heavy, wetting rainfall is likely to limit or prevent
fire spread, but numerous holdover fires will be possible.
* Affected area:
In Northern CA...Fire Weather Zone 282.
* Additional Information: While this fire weather zone typically is
missed by thunderstorm outbreaks, there are indications that
thunderstorms are likely to move through this area this evening
or overnight, and then, again, Tuesday afternoon and evening.
While the storms are likely to bring welcome precipitation,
numerous lightning strikes also have a high chance of starting
new fires that could spread in areas with little or no
precipitation or after the vegetation dries out again.

Precautionary/preparedness actions...
A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions are
either occurring now or will shortly. These conditions promote
rapid spread of fire which may become life threatening. Evacuate if
ordered to, or if a fire threatens.
