scar, just southwest of Pearblossom, with Doopler radar
estimating rainfall rates up to one inch per hour. Roadway
and small stream flooding is expected to begin shortly in the
advisory area.

Pearblossom, Llano, Littlerock, Valyermo, Highway 138 between

<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas. The heavy rain could trigger
shallow mud and debris flows, minor rock falls, and flooding capable
of localized damage, especially in steep terrain in and near burn
scars.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
