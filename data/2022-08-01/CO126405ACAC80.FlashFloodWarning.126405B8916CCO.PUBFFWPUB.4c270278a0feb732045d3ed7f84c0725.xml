<description>The National Weather Service in Pueblo has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
The Decker Burn Scar in...
Southeastern Chaffee County in central Colorado...

* Until 715 PM MDT.
* At 520 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing

rain has fallen. The expected rainfall rate is 1 to 2 inches in 1
hour. Additional rainfall amounts of 0.5 to 1 inch are possible in
the warned area. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin
shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar may result in debris flow
moving through the Bear Creek and Rock Creek. The debris flow can
consist of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.

producing flash flooding in and around the Decker Burn
Scar.

<instruction>This is a life threatening situation. Heavy rainfall will cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks...streams...and
ditches in the Decker Burn Scar. Severe debris flows can also be
anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may be washed away in
places. If you encounter flood waters...climb to safety.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
