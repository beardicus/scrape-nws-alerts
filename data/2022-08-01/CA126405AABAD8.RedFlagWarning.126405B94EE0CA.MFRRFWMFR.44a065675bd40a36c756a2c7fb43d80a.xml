low pressure impulses moving through this afternoon/evening and
again Tuesday are expected to bring isolated to scattered
thunderstorms and abundant lightning on dry fuels to the area.

from the Cascades eastward as well as over western Siskiyou,
Josephine and western Jackson Counties. On Tuesday, the lightning
threat will be greatest from the Cascades east, Siskiyous south and
into southwestern Jackson County.

...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH

WEATHER ZONES 284...285...623...624 AND 625...
The National Weather Service in Medford has issued a Fire Weather
Watch...which is in effect from Tuesday afternoon through Tuesday
evening.
* Impacts: Lightning and high fire danger will likely result in
new fire starts. Gusty thunderstorm winds could contribute to
fire spread. Despite rainfall, initial attack resources could be
overwhelmed and holdover fires are possible.
* Affected area:
In Northern CA Fire Zones...284...285.
In Southwest and South Central OR Fire Zones...623...624...625.
* Thunderstorms: Isolated to scattered thunderstorms and showers
will develop this afternoon and evening with the best chance of
scattered storms with abundant lightning from the Cascades east
and across western portions of Siskiyou County into Josephine and
western Jackson Counties. On Tuesday, expect a mix of isolated
and scattered showers and thunderstorms with the best chance for
thunderstorms from the Siskiyous south, Cascades east and into
southwestern Jackson County.
* Rainfall: Today and Tuesday, thunderstorms are expected to be a
mix of wet and dry, so locally significant wetting rainfall will
be possible with some of the thunderstorms, especially the slower
moving ones. Lighting may occur outside of the storm cores where
there is little or no rainfall.

If you have not packed your evacuation kit yet, now is the time to
do so. This includes items like important documents and essentials
you cannot live without. Fill your vehicle`s fuel tank. Visit
ready.gov/kit for more information.
Plan now to avoid using equipment that could cause sparks during
the period when critical weather conditions are possible. Visit
weather.gov/medford/wildfire for links to fire restrictions in
your area.
A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are possible during the valid watch time. These conditions could
promote the rapid spread of wildfires which could become life-
threatening. Check weather.gov/medford for forecast updates and a
possible upgrade of the this watch to a Red Flag Warning.
