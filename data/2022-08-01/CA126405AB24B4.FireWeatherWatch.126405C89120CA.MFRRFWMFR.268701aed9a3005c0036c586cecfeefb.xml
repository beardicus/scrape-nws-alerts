<description>...Abundant Lightning On Dry Fuels Expected through Tuesday...
.Heat, instability, and increasing moisture along with multiple
low pressure impulses moving through this afternoon/evening and
again Tuesday are expected to bring isolated to scattered
thunderstorms and abundant lightning on dry fuels to the area.
This afternoon and evening the lightning threat will be greatest
from the Cascades eastward as well as over western Siskiyou,
Josephine and western Jackson Counties. On Tuesday, the lightning
threat will be greatest from the Cascades east, Siskiyous south
and into southwestern Jackson County.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH TUESDAY EVENING FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR
FIRE WEATHER ZONE 282...
* Impacts: Lightning and high fire danger will likely result in
new fire starts. Gusty thunderstorm winds could contribute to
fire spread. Despite rainfall, initial attack resources could be
overwhelmed and holdover fires are possible.
* Affected area:
In Northern CA...Fire Weather Zone 282.
* Thunderstorms: On Tuesday, expect a mix of isolated and
scattered shower and thunderstorms with the best chance for
thunderstorms from the Siskiyous south, Cascades east as well as
into southwestern Jackson County.
* Rainfall: Thunderstorms are expected to be a mix of wet and dry,
so locally significant wetting rainfall will be possible with
some of the thunderstorms, especially the slower moving ones.
Lighting may occur outside of the storm cores where there is
little or no rainfall.
