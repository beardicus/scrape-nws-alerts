<description>...Abundant Lightning On Dry Fuels Expected through Tuesday...
.Heat, instability, and increasing moisture along with multiple
low pressure impulses moving through this afternoon/evening and
again Tuesday are expected to bring isolated to scattered
thunderstorms and abundant lightning on dry fuels to the area.
This afternoon and evening the lightning threat will be greatest
from the Cascades eastward as well as over western Siskiyou,
Josephine and western Jackson Counties. On Tuesday, the lightning
threat will be greatest from the Cascades east, Siskiyous south and
into southwestern Jackson County.

...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
TUESDAY EVENING FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE
WEATHER ZONES 280...281...621 AND 622...
The National Weather Service in Medford has issued a Red Flag
Warning...which is in effect from noon today to 11 PM PDT this
evening. A Fire Weather Watch has also been issued. This Fire
Weather Watch is in effect from Tuesday afternoon through Tuesday
evening.
* Impacts: Lightning and high fire danger will likely result in new
fire starts. Gusty  thunderstorm winds could contribute to fire
spread. Despite rainfall, initial attack resources could be
overwhelmed and holdover fires are possible.
* Affected area:
In Northern CA Fire Zones...280...281.
In Southwest OR Fire Zones...621...622.
* Thunderstorms: Isolated to scattered thunderstorms and showers
will develop this afternoon and evening with the best chance if
scattered storms with abundant lightning across western portions
of Siskiyou County into Josephine and western Jackson Counties as
well as from the Cascades today.  On Tuesday, expect a mix of
isolated and scattered shower and thunderstorms with the best
chance for thunderstorms from the Siskiyous south, Cascades east
and into southwestern Jackson County.
* Rainfall: Today and Tuesday, thunderstorms are expected to be a
mix of wet and dry, so locally significant wetting rainfall will
be possible with some of the thunderstorms, especially the slower
moving ones. Lighting may occur outside of the storm cores where
there is little or no rainfall.

A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are possible during the valid watch time. These conditions could
promote the rapid spread of wildfires which could become life-
