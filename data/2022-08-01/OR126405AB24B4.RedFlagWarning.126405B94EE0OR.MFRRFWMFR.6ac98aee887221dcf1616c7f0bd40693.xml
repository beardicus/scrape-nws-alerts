<headline>Red Flag Warning issued August 01 at 6:17AM PDT until August 01 at 11:00PM PDT by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...Abundant Lightning On Dry Fuels Expected through Tuesday...
.Heat, instability, and increasing moisture along with multiple
low pressure impulses moving through this afternoon/evening and
again Tuesday are expected to bring isolated to scattered
thunderstorms and abundant lightning on dry fuels to the area.
This afternoon and evening the lightning threat will be greatest
from the Cascades eastward as well as over western Siskiyou,
Josephine and western Jackson Counties. On Tuesday, the lightning
threat will be greatest from the Cascades east, Siskiyous south
and into southwestern Jackson County.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO 11 PM PDT
THIS EVENING FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE WEATHER
ZONE 620...
* Impacts: Lightning and high fire danger will likely result in new
fire starts. Gusty thunderstorm winds could contribute to fire
spread. Despite rainfall, initial attack resources could be
overwhelmed and holdover fires are possible.
* Affected area:
In Southwest OR...Fire Weather Zones 617 and 620.
* Thunderstorms: Isolated to scattered thunderstorms and showers
will develop this afternoon and evening with the best chance of
scattered storms with abundant lightning across western portions
of Siskiyou County into Josephine and western Jackson Counties as
well as from the Cascades east.
* Rainfall: Thunderstorms are expected to be a mix of wet and dry,
so locally significant wetting rainfall will be possible with
some of the thunderstorms, especially the slower moving ones.
Lighting may occur outside of the storm cores where there is
little or no rainfall.
