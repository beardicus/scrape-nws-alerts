<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING FOR THE SPRING BURN SCAR REMAINS IN EFFECT
UNTIL 8 PM MDT THIS EVENING FOR NORTHEASTERN COSTILLA COUNTY...
At 550 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms that produced
heavy rain over the Spring Burn Scar have weakened considerably.
Between 0.5 and 1.5 inches of rain have fallen. Flash flooding is
ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar may result in debris flow
moving through the Wagon Creek, Bear Creek, East Bear Creek. The
debris flow can consist of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose
materials.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms producing
flash flooding in and around the Spring Burn Scar.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Life threatening flash flooding of areas in and around
the Spring Burn Scar.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Spring Burn Scar south of Highway 160 in Costilla county.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>This is a life threatening situation. Heavy rainfall will cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks...streams...and
ditches in the Spring Burn Scar. Severe debris flows can also be
anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may be washed away in
places. If you encounter flood waters...climb to safety.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.</instruction>
