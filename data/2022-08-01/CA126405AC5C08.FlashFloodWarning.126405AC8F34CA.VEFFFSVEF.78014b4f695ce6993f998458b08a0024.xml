<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 345 PM PDT THIS
AFTERNOON FOR THE MORONGO BASIN...
At 214 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing heavy
rain across the warned area. Between 1 and 1.5 inches of rain have
fallen per radar estimates and local officials have reported the
beginning of flood impacts in the area. Significant heavy rainfall
has already occurred south of State Route 62 as well as over it.
Another round of similar rainfall rates is expected in the same
areas and the risk for further flash flooding is increasing.
HAZARD...Life-threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms producing
flash flooding.
SOURCE...Radar and local emergency management.
IMPACT...Life-threatening flash flooding of low-water crossings,
creeks, normally dry washes and both secondary and
primary roadways.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Yucca Valley, Joshua Tree Lake Campground and Joshua Tree and the
State Route 62 corridor west of Twentynine Palms.
Flooding is likely occurring along and south of State Route 62
between Sunfair and Lear Ave based on where the heaviest rainfall
has occurred.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles so be aware of your surroundings and do not
drive on flooded roads.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
