<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING FOR THE JACOB CITY BURN SCAR REMAINS IN
EFFECT UNTIL 945 PM MDT THIS EVENING FOR EASTERN TOOELE COUNTY...
At 819 PM MDT, Tooele County Emergency Management reported sounds of
rock movement and some visible water flowing within interior areas
of the Jacob City burn scar during earlier inspection. More
information is expected after 9pm this evening. Flash flooding is
ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through the Soldier Canyon. The debris flow can consist of
rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms producing
flash flooding in and around the Jacob City Burn Scar.
SOURCE...Emergency Management reported.
IMPACT...Life threatening flash flooding of areas in and around
the Jacob City Burn Scar.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Stockton.
FLASH FLOOD...OBSERVED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry washes is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
