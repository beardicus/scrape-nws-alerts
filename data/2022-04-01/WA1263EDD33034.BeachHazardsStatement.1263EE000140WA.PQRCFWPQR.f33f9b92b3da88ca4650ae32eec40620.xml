<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued April 01 at 3:29AM PDT until April 03 at 9:00PM PDT by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM LATE SATURDAY NIGHT
THROUGH SUNDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Sneaker waves possible.
* WHERE...In Oregon, North Oregon Coast and Central Oregon
Coast. In Washington, South Washington Coast.
* WHEN...From late Saturday night through Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...Sneaker waves can surge high up the beach without
warning, catching an inattentive individual off guard. They can
run up significantly farther on a beach than normal, including
over rocks and jetties as well as lifting or rolling extremely
heavy logs. If you see someone swept into the sea do not swim
in after them. Call 911 and keep an eye on them until help
arrives.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...While the greatest threat for sneaker waves
at this time will likely occur Sunday, there will be an elevated
threat of sneaker waves beginning today that will likely persist
through the start of next week. Those digging for Razor Clams or
who will be visiting the beaches should remain vigilant.</description>
<instruction>A Beach Hazards Statement is issued when sneaker waves create
potentially life-threatening conditions in the surf zone. Caution
should be used when in or near the water. Always keep an eye on
the waves, and be especially watchful of children.</instruction>
