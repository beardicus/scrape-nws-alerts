<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued June 14 at 2:34AM MDT until June 15 at 6:00AM MDT by NWS GreatFalls</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM MDT WEDNESDAY
FOR ELEVATIONS ABOVE 5000 FEET...
* WHAT...Heavy snow for elevations above 5000 feet. Additional snow
accumulations of up to 10 inches from 5000 feet to 6000 feet,
between 10 and 20 inches from 6000 feet to 7000 feet, and up to 30
inches above 7000 feet. Winds gusting as high as 70 mph.
* WHERE...Northern Rocky Mountain Front.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM MDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult over Marias Pass and
other routes within or adjacent to Glacier National Park.
Dangerous backcountry conditions will exist, especially for those
recreating in the high country of Glacier National Park due to
reduced visibilities and the cold and wet conditions. High
snowfall rates in the high country will quickly lead to snow
covered routes, and could lead to disorientation. Strong winds
could cause extensive damage to snow-loaded trees and power lines.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The National Weather Service recommends that
those who are recreating in the back country, especially those who
are not prepared for winter conditions, should move to lower
elevations.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road conditions can
be obtained by calling 5 1 1 or visiting the MDT Road Report website.</instruction>
