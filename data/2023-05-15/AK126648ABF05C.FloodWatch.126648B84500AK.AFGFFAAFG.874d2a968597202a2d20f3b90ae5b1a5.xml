<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR SNOWMELT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH WEDNESDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by snowmelt continues to be possible.
* WHERE...The Upper Chena River Upstream of the Moose Creek Dam
* WHEN...Through Wednesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Rising water levels may go overbank in low lying areas
on the Upper Chena River upstream of the Moose Creek Dam to Chena
Hot Springs. River access points in the Chena River Recreation
Area will likely be inundated with water. Gravel bars will be
underwater, water will flow into the brush line along the river,
and increased debris will be moving down the river
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Warm temperatures will continue to melt high elevation
snowpack in the Chena River Basin. Runoff from snowmelt is
causing river levels to gradually rise on the Upper Chena
River and will continue this week. Water levels may climb
above minor flood stage upstream of the Granite Tors
Campground today. This crest of high water will gradually
move down the Upper Chena River and reach the Moose Creek Dam
on Wednesday.

- Please stay tuned to NOAA weather radio or your favorite local
weather news source for updates on this situation.
- If you live near or along Upper Chena River upstream of the
Moose Creek Dam stay alert and be prepared to take action.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
