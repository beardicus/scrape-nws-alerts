<headline>Air Quality Alert issued May 15 at 2:39PM CDT  by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM CDT TUESDAY THROUGH 4 PM
CDT TUESDAY...
WHAT...The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has issued an Air
Quality Alert for fine particle pollution. The Air Quality Index
(AQI) is expected to reach the Orange or Unhealthy for Sensitive
Groups category.
WHERE...central Minnesota.
WHEN...From 4 AM CDT Tuesday through 4 PM CDT Tuesday.
IMPACTS...Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease
(including asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults,
may experience health effects.
ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A band of smoke from wildfires in northern
Alberta and Saskatchewan is currently moving east across Ontario.
A strong cold front will dive south overnight and begin pulling
this smoke south towards Minnesota. Sinking air behind the front
will bring this smoke to the surface. Smoke will cross the
Canadian border into northern Minnesota around 4 a.m. Tuesday.
Northerly winds will push the smoke as far south as Hinckley and
Alexandria by Tuesday afternoon. Air quality should improve across
northeast Minnesota Tuesday afternoon. Smoke may linger across
northwest Minnesota through Tuesday. Fine particle levels are
expected to reach the orange air quality index (AQI) category, a
level considered unhealthy for sensitive groups, across northern
and central Minnesota. This area includes Alexandria, Little
Falls, and the tribal nation of Mille Lacs. In the orange area,
sensitive groups should avoid prolonged time outdoors.

<instruction>Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including
asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults, should
limit prolonged or heavy exertion.
Keep windows closed overnight to prevent smoke from getting
indoors.
Reduce or eliminate activities that contribute to air pollution,
such as outdoor burning, and use of residential wood burning
devices. Reduce vehicle trips and vehicle idling as much as
possible.</instruction>
