.Rivers continue to be swollen due to rainfall over the last 5 days,

few of the quick-reacting rivers have already or are close to
cresting and will steadily begin dropping off over the coming days,
with the Redwood River at Redwood Falls already in Action Stage. Dry

small event, thus we expect river levels to continue dropping once
the crests occur.
