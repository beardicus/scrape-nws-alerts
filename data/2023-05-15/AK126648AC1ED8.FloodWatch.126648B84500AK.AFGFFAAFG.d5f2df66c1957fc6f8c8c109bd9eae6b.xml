<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH TUESDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues to be possible.
* WHERE...The Yukon River at the Dalton Highway Bridge, Stevens
Village, and Beaver
* WHEN...Through Tuesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Ice jam flooding is possible at Beaver today and Stevens
Village and the Yukon River Bridge tonight or Tuesday. If an ice
jam forms, water will rise very rapidly and people may need to
evacuate to higher ground at a moments notice. Large ice chunks
could also push overbank and into communities. Prepare your
community now for flooding, and where possible, move items to
higher ground.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Significant ice jam flooding occurred at Fort Yukon and
Circle over the weekend. This surge of ice and water is
moving downriver and expected to reach Beaver today and
Stevens Village tonight or Tuesday morning. It is possible
this surge of ice and water may get stopped and jam when it
meets intact ice downriver.
As of Noon Monday, the River Watch team reported ice has
locally shifted at Stevens Village. Strong ice remains in
place downstream of Stevens Village at the start of the
Rampart Canyon and there is a high probability ice could jam
in this location and cause flooding at Stevens Village.

- If you live near or along the Yukon River from the Yukon River
Bridge upstream to Beaver, stay alert and be prepared to take
action.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
