<description>...FLOOD WARNING FOR AN ICE JAM IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AKDT TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam is expected.
* WHERE...The Yukon River At Stevens Village.
* WHEN...Until 600 PM AKDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of low lying areas near Stevens Village is
expected. Flooding as well as large blocks of ice being pushed
onshore is possible. When an ice jam forms downstream, water will
rise very rapidly, and water will remain high until the ice jam
releases.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 201 PM AKDT, The River Watch Team reports a forty mile
long run of bank-to-bank ice and high water approaching
Stevens Village. There is strong in-place ice downriver at
the start of the canyon, and it is likely an ice jam will
form near this location.
- It is expected that the surge of ice and high water will
arrive at Stevens Village Monday evening, and flooding is
likely Monday night and Tuesday morning.

- If you live near or along the Yukon River river at Stevens
Village, stay alert and be prepared to take action.</description>
