<description>...THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE IN GRAND JUNCTION CO HAS ISSUED A
FLOOD WARNING FOR THE FOLLOWING RIVERS IN COLORADO...
ELKHEAD CREEK ABOVE ELKHEAD RESERVOIR AFFECTING ROUTT AND MOFFAT
COUNTIES.
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt is expected to begin
tonight.
* WHERE...Elkhead Creek near Hayden.
* WHEN...Until noon MDT Friday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is expected tonight. Streams continue to
rise due to excess runoff from warm antecedent conditions and
potential rainfall on a deep snowpack. Low-water crossings may
become inundated with water and may not be passable.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1211 PM MDT, forecast hydrographs indicate warm
temperatures combined with rain on snow will accelerate
snowmelt, leading to increased runoff. Flooding is expected
to begin tonight in the warned area.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
mainly rural areas of East Central Moffat and West Central
Routt Counties, north of Hayden.
