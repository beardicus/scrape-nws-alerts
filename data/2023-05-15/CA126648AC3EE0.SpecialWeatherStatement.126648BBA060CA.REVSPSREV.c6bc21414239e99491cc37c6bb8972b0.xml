<description>...Heating Up with Rises on Area Waterways...
...Chances for Showers and Thunderstorms Late This Week...
Heat:
* Highs will warm 15-20 degrees above average by late this week.
This translates to upper-80s to near 90 degrees across western
Nevada valleys and upper-60s to mid-70s for Sierra valleys.
These temperatures are more typical in late June and could
introduce moderate heat risks to sensitive individuals in warmer
western Nevada valleys Thursday through the weekend.
Snowmelt and Stream Rises:
* Rising temperatures will continue accelerating snowmelt this
week. If recreating outdoors, stay away from streams and rivers
as they will flow fast, cold, and high. While it may seem like a
good idea to jump into the rivers to cool off, the water is
extremely cold and shock can quickly set it, causing loss of
motor function. There are also likely to be snow bridges
present in the backcountry with water flowing beneath them. Use
extreme caution.
* There is potential for the East and West Forks of the
Carson River to reach minor flood stage later this week and into
the weekend. The East and West Forks and Mainstem of the Walker
River could reach minor to moderate flood stage during the same
time frame. For more detailed river forecasts, visit
www.cnrfc.noaa.gov.
Shower and Thunderstorm Chances:
* Shower and thunderstorm chances return mid-late week, but will
be spotty, with a 10-15% chance mainly in southern Mono/Mineral
Co. These chances will expand across the eastern Sierra and
western Nevada by the weekend with a 15-25% chance at any given
location to see a storm.</description>
