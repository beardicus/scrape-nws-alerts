<description>...FLOOD WARNING FOR AN ICE JAM REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AKDT
TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues.
* WHERE...The Yukon River At Stevens Village.
* WHEN...Until 600 PM AKDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of low lying areas near Stevens Village is
occuring. Water is now rising rapidly and moving over the bank.
Water has moved up to 2 cabins, and is expected to continue rising
tonight. Many of the cabins in Stevens Village could be surrounded
by water and possibly flood.  Moderate to major flooding is
possible. Large blocks of ice could push onshore. Water will
remain high until the ice jam releases.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 915 PM AKDT, An employee at the Yukon river Bridge reports
that people in Stevens Village had called to report that
water has been rising rapidly the past several hours and that
water is over the bank and up to two cabins. The same
employee reports that ice remain solidly in place from the
Yukon River bridge upstream. Earlier today the River Watch
Team reported a forty mile long run of bank-to-bank ice and
high water approaching Stevens Village with strong in-place
ice downriver at the start of the canyon. It is expected that
the ice and high water that was moving downstream earlier
today is now jammed up against the ice that remains in place
in the canyon, and is backing water up into Stevens Village.
