<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued February 12 at 4:01PM AKST until February 13 at 6:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM AKST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow and blowing snow expected. Total snow
accumulations of 3 to 7 inches. Visibility reduced to one half
mile or less at times. East winds gusting as high as 80 mph.
* WHERE...Central Aleutians.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM AKST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Areas of blowing snow could significantly reduce
visibility. Very strong winds could damage property and cause
power outages.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A strong front will approach from the south
this evening with precipitation along the front initially
beginning as heavy snow. Temperatures will warm as the front
lifts north past the Aleutians overnight, allowing snow to
change over to mainly rain. The strongest winds gusting between
70 and 80 mph will also drop off rapidly behind the frontal
passage, leading to overall improving conditions early Monday
morning.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Warning for snow means severe winter weather
conditions will make travel very hazardous. If you must travel,
keep an extra flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case
of an emergency.</instruction>
