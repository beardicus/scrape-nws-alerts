* WHAT...Large breaking waves of 6 to 9 feet with dangerous rip
currents, highest on west facing beaches.

this afternoon. Another round of even larger surf is expected to
affect the area beginning late Monday, with peak surf heights
of 8 to 14 feet possible Tuesday into Wednesday.</description>

can be deadly locations in such conditions.</instruction>
