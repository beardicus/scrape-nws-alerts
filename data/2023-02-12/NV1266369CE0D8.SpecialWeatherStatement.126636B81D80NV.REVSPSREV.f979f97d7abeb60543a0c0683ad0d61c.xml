<description>...GUSTY WINDS MONDAY-TUESDAY ALONG WITH SNOW SHOWERS AND MUCH
COLDER TEMPERATURES...
A very cold winter system will arrive late Monday reminding us
that we are still in the middle of winter.
WINDS: West to northwest winds will begin to increase Monday
afternoon, shifting out of the north Tuesday. Gusts of 35-45 mph
are expected region-wide, stronger in higher elevations and wind
prone locations. This will bring rough conditions on area lakes,
Pyramid Lake in particular, and potential ground and air travel
difficulties.
SNOW: Snow showers will develop Monday night into Tuesday,
primarily for areas near and south of I-80 both in the Sierra and
western Nevada. A secondary round of snow will develop in the
Sierra and northeast California Tuesday and Tuesday evening. While
overall totals will be light, generally a dusting up to 3 inches,
it doesn`t take much to cause travel difficulties. Check with
CalTrans Quickmap or NDOT NVRoads for the latest on road
conditions.
COLD: After a relatively warm day Monday, Tuesday will be a harsh
shock to the system. High temperatures will remain in the 30s
Tuesday and Wednesday in even the warmest of valleys, with teens
and 20s in the mountains. Widespread teen and single digit lows
can be expected, with colder valleys dipping below zero. To add
insult to injury, the addition of wind will make it feel even
colder, especially Monday night and Tuesday. Wind chill values
will easily be in the single digit to below zero range at times.
Bundle up Tuesday and Wednesday and be sure to protect vulnerable
populations as well as pets. Allow extra time for the morning
commute Tuesday, especially if you live near or south of I-80.</description>
