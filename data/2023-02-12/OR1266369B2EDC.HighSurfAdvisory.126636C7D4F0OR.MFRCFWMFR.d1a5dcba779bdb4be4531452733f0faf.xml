<headline>High Surf Advisory issued February 12 at 2:39AM PST until February 14 at 7:00PM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM PST THIS
MORNING THROUGH THIS EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM MONDAY TO 7 PM PST
TUESDAY...
* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, moderate to high risk of
sneaker waves expected. These are waves that run unusually
higher up on beaches when compared to other observed waves. For
the High Surf Advisory, large, breaking waves of 22 to 25 ft
are expected in the surf zone.
* WHERE...All beaches and shorelines of Douglas, Coos, and Curry
Counties.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, from 8 AM PST this
morning through this evening. For the High Surf Advisory, from 4
PM Monday to 7 PM PST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...For the Beach Hazards Statement, sneaker waves can
sweep up the beach without warning and knock unsuspecting people
over and pull them out to sea. For the High Surf Advisory,
large breaking waves will create hazardous conditions along and
within the surf zone, and could inundate beaches and low lying
shorelines. Beach erosion is possible, and exposed
infrastructure may be damaged.
