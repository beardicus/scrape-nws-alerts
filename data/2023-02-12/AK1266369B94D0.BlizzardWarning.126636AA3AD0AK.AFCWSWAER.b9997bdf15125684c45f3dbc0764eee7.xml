<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO MIDNIGHT
AKST TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions expected. Total snow accumulations of
up to 3 inches. West to southwest winds 15 to 30 mph with gusts
as high as 40 mph. Reduced visibilities to one quarter mile.
* WHERE...Homer.
* WHEN...From noon today to midnight AKST tonight.
* IMPACTS...Plan on difficult travel conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility to one quarter mile
or less at times.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Expect periods of light snow through
tonight. Southwest winds will rapidly strengthen between 9 am
and Noon on Sunday, then peak during the afternoon and early
evening hours. With temperatures in the 20s, snow will easily be
lofted and immediately result in low visibilities. Conditions
will gradually improve late this evening into the overnight
hours as winds diminish.</description>
<instruction>A Blizzard Warning means severe winter weather conditions are
expected or occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds
and poor visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout
conditions, making travel very hazardous. If you must travel,
have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded, stay
with your vehicle.
