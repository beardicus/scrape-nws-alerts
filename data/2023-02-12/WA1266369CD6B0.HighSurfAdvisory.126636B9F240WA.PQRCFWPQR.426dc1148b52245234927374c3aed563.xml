<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM NOON MONDAY TO 4 AM PST
TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Large waves and hazardous surf conditions. Breakers of 20
to 25 feet.
* WHERE...South Washington Coast.
* WHEN...From noon Monday to 4 AM PST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Destructive waves may wash over beaches, jetties, and
other structures unexpectedly. People can be swept off rocks and
jetties and drown while observing high surf. Minor beach erosion
may damage coastal properties and buildings. Higher than normal
water run-up is expected on beaches and low-lying shoreline.</description>
<instruction>A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches,
producing rip currents, sneaker waves and beach erosion. Stay
well back from the water`s edge and be alert for exceptionally
high waves.
Keep away from large logs on the beach. Water running up on the
beach can easily lift or roll logs which can injure or kill
someone caught in their path.</instruction>
