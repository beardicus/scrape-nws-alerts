<description>...Areas of Smoke With Poor Air Quality...
*Smoke from the Mosquito Fire is bringing unhealthy to hazardous
air quality to many areas this evening. The worst conditions,
based on observations, is from Donner Summit east into the Tahoe
Basin, stretching into the Greater Reno/Sparks/Carson City/Minden
areas. Visibility is below 2 miles in smoke through many of
these locations, so please be careful while traveling as well.
*Looking ahead, the latest high resolution near surface smoke
model is indicating these areas will remain in the smoke
overnight into Monday morning, with smoke likely to continue
eastward. Smoke is expected to follow a similar pattern on Monday
as we saw on Sunday.
*There will be some improvement mid-morning into the early
afternoon for many locations. The one exception will be areas
immediately downwind of the fire, such as Donner Lake and Truckee
where air quality is likely to remain poor. Another wave of
smoke is forecast to push into the region tomorrow afternoon and
evening.
*Additional smoke is moving into far northern California and
Nevada near the Oregon border due to the Barnes Fire, with minor
air quality reductions.
*For the latest air quality information: fire.airnow.gov, or
check with your local Air Quality Management Division. Please
follow their recommendations to stay safe from the degraded air
quality.</description>
