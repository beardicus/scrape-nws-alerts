<description>...LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL POSSIBLE ...
This Hydrologic Outlook is for Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan in
the Mariana Islands.
A tropical circulation continues to slowly develop northwest of
the CNMI. This system is forecast to gradually strengthen as it
continues to move away from the region. As it does so, the latest
model forecasts continue to show another weak circulation
developing very near the CNMI and move slowly to the west. This in
turn allows a monsoon flow to develop over the CNMI, and the
Marianas. Todays models remain at odds with regard to how gets how
much rainfall, and when is the best potential for heavy rainfall
to occur.
Timing: Wednesday through Friday
Locations: The Mariana Islands
Amounts: Northern CNMI     - 4 to 7 inches
Tinian and Saipan - 3 to 5 inches
Guam and Rota     - 2 to 4 inches
Note: All locations may see locally higher rainfall totals
Should this occur as forecast, urban and small stream flooding
would be a possibility.
Closely monitor this developing situation in the event watches,
advisories, or warnings are needed. Forecasts will likely change in
the next few days.
Make sure nearby storm drains are not clogged, especially for
low-lying or flood-prone areas.</description>
