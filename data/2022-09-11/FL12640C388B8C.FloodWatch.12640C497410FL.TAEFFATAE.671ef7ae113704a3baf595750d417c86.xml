<headline>Flood Watch issued September 11 at 2:19AM EDT until September 12 at 1:00PM EDT by NWS Tallahassee</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Big Bend Florida and Panhandle Florida,
including the following areas, in Big Bend Florida, Coastal Bay,
Coastal Dixie, Coastal Franklin, Coastal Jefferson, Coastal
Taylor, Coastal Wakulla, Gadsden, Inland Dixie, Inland Franklin,
Inland Jefferson, Inland Taylor, Inland Wakulla, Lafayette, Leon,
Liberty and Madison. In Panhandle Florida, Calhoun, Central
Walton, Coastal Gulf, Inland Bay, Inland Gulf, South Walton and
Washington.
* WHEN...Through this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water crossings may be
flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Recent heavy rains have led to saturated soils, especially
across the watch area along the coast. In these locations,
widespread rainfall amounts have been around 4 to 6 inches
over the last 48 hours, but isolated locations have seen two
day totals nearing 7 to 8 inches. While many inland locations
across the watch area have no received flooding rains over
the last several days, the potential remains for isolated
areas of 2 to 4 inch rainfall amounts in training storms, and
along the coastline, additional rainfall amounts of 3 to 6
inches can`t be ruled out in isolated areas. While widespread
rain totals through today will only be around 2 to 3 inches,
it`s there localized higher rainfall totals which could drive
new flooding, especially if they fall across regions of
already saturated ground.
