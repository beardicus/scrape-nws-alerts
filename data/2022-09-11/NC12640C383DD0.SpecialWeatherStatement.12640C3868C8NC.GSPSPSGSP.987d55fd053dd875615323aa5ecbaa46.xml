<description>...HEAVY RAIN SHOWERS WILL IMPACT UNION COUNTY UNTIL 130 AM EDT...
At 1216 AM EDT, Doppler radar was tracking a large shield of
moderate rain with embedded heavy rain showers overspreading Union
County North Carolina. Rainfall rates were generally one-quarter to
one-half inch per hour in the heaviest downpours, and this rain will
affect locations that have received from 1 to 3 inches of rain in
the past six hours.
Locations to be impacted include...
Monroe, Indian Trail, Weddington, Stallings, Unionville, Wesley
Chapel, Wingate, Waxhaw, Marshville and Lake Park.
Deep ponding of water may develop in low-lying and poor drainage
areas. Many area streams and creeks are running at elevated levels
or near bankfull. Isolated flooding could develop, especially near
Bearskin Creek and Beaverdam Creek south of Monroe.</description>
<instruction>Heavy rainfall may flood areas with poor drainage, such as ditches
and underpasses. Avoid these areas and do not cross flooded roads.
Water levels of small streams may also rise rapidly. Seek higher
ground if threatened by flood waters.</instruction>
