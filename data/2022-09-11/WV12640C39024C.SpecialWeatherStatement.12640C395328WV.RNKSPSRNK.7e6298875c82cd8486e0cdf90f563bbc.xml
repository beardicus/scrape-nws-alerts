<description>...Patchy Dense Fog Expected Through the Early Morning Hours...
Across the Higher Terrain of the Blue Ridge...
A very moist atmosphere and light easterly flow has resulted in
widespread low clouds across the region early this morning. These
low clouds are intersecting the higher terrain of the Blue Ridge
resulting in areas of dense fog. Visibility may be reduced to near
0 miles at elevations above 2500 ft. throughout much of the
morning. In addition, patchy dense fog has developed at lower
elevations as well across the foothills and piedmont areas of
North Carolina and Virginia as well as into the Roanoke Valley and
the New River Valley.
Please use extreme caution if you plan to travel throughout the
higher terrain of the Blue Ridge this morning including areas from
Boone, to Jefferson, to Independence, to Fancy Gap, Hillsville,
and Floyd. Also be alert for patchy dense fog in other surrounding
areas as you travel early this morning. Reduce speed, use low
beam headlights, and allow extra time to reach your destination.
Some roads and highways that will be impacted with dense fog early
this morning include:
Interstate 77 through northwest NC and southwest VA,
Interstate 81 from mile markers 35 to 180,
Much of the Blue Ridge Parkway through northwest NC and southwest
VA.</description>
