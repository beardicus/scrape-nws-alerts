<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued September 11 at 2:27PM PDT until September 11 at 5:30PM PDT by NWS SanDiego</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in San Diego has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
South Central San Diego County in southwestern California...
* Until 530 PM PDT.
* At 227 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing
heavy rain across the warned area. Between 0.75 and 1.25 inches of
rain have fallen. Additional rainfall amounts of 0.75 to 1.25
inches are possible in the warned area. Flash flooding is ongoing
or expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through the Valley Burn Scar and the Border32 Fire. The
debris flow can consist of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose
materials.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms
producing flash flooding.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Life threatening flash flooding of creeks and streams,
urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
El Cajon, Alpine, I-8 Between Pine Valley And Boulevard, Cuyamaca
Rancho State Park, Potrero, Lake Morena, Campo, Pine Valley,
Descanso and Crest.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>This is a life threatening situation. Heavy rainfall may cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks, streams, and ditches
in the Valley Burn Scar. Severe debris flows can also be anticipated
across roads. Roads and driveways may be washed away in places. If
you encounter flood waters, climb to safety.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.</instruction>
