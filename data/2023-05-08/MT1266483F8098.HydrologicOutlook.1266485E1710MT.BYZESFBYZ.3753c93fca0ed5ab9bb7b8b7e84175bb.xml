<description>...Heavy rain mid to late week may lead to flooding...
A strong storm system is expected to bring heavy rainfall to the
area, starting Wednesday afternoon and continuing through Friday.
Rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches are likely through the event, with
some pockets of 3+ inches possible. This heavy rain will cause
rivers and streams to rise aggressively, with flooding possible
where rainfall is heaviest.
Heavy rain could fall on existing snow in the foothills below 8
thousand feet, which could lead to even faster water rises.
Where the heaviest precipitation falls will determine which rivers
and streams see the most significant rises. At the moment, areas of
Sheridan county Wyoming, including the Bighorn foothills, along with
sections of Big Horn county, southern Rosebud county, and western
sections of Powder River county, look like the most likely location
for the heaviest rainfall, and therefore, the highest possibility of
flooding. Rivers and streams in these locations look to be the most
susceptible to flooding.
Those with interests along area waterways should be prepared for high
water levels and move property and livestock away from rivers,
streams, and low lying areas. Bank erosion will make shorelines
unstable. Do not walk near streambanks as the underlying soil may be
eroded. Do not allow children to play near the water`s edge.
Heavy precipitation may fill culverts, ditches, and storm drains
causing water to flow over roadways, potentially causing damage. Do
not drive over flooded roadways, Turn Around Don`t Drown.
Recreationists in the mountains and foothills should be prepared for
changing conditions and use extra caution when near waterways. Flows
will be fast, and the water is cold.
Stay tuned to the forecast. Please report any flooding to local law
enforcement and have them relay the report to the National Weather
Service.</description>
