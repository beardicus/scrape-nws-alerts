<description>...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FOR WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND
EVENING FOR SOUTHWEST AND SOUTH CENTRAL NEW MEXICO...
.The region continues in an extended period of warm and dry
conditions, as deep southwest flow delivers breezy afternoons. As
such, fuels are continuing to dry. On Wednesday a Pacific low
will eject across the Four Corners Region, tightening pressure
gradients and inducing surface troughing. This will increase wind
speeds across the area on Wednesday. A windy afternoon and
evening will elevate fire weather conditions to critical. The
probability for new wildfire starts and large growth of any
existing fires will be increased. Despite continued warm and dry
conditions through Friday, winds will slacken. Relief is possible
by Saturday as moisture looks to move in from the east to raise
relative humditiy, and bring scattered rain showers.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
WEDNESDAY EVENING FOR STRONG WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR
FIRE WEATHER ZONES 110, 111, 112, AND 113...
