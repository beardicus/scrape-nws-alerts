<description>...THUNDERSTORMS WITH FREQUENT LIGHTNING AND HEAVY RAINFALL WILL
IMPACT FRANKLIN...STEPHENS...HABERSHAM...RABUN AND OCONEE COUNTIES
UNTIL 215 AM EDT...
At 117 AM EDT, Doppler radar indicated a cluster of thunderstorms
with frequent lightning and heavy rainfall along a line extending
from 3 miles southeast of Clayton to 5 miles northwest of Toccoa to
10 miles northwest of Homer, and moving east at 30 mph.
Locations to be impacted include...
Toccoa, Seneca, Walhalla, Clayton, Clarkesville, Carnesville,
Cornelia, Baldwin, Westminster and Lavonia.
Very heavy rainfall rates up to one inch per hour will be possible
in these areas.</description>
<instruction>The combination of gusty winds and saturated soil conditions could
cause a few trees to fall and isolated power outages may result.
The heavy rainfall may produce isolated flooding in areas with poor
drainage, such as ditches and underpasses. Avoid these areas and do
not cross flooded roads. Water levels of small streams may also rise
rapidly.
Frequent lightning is occurring with these storms. If outdoors, try
to get indoors or into a hard topped vehicle. Otherwise, stay away
from open areas and isolated high objects such as trees. When
indoors, stay away from windows and doors and avoid using wired
electronic devices. Do not take a shower or bath. Try to unplug
unnecessary appliances before the storms approach.</instruction>
