<description>...High Water Levels Remain on Lincoln County Rivers and Streams...
Warmer temperatures through Wednesday will allow for continued
snowmelt, but it will not be warm enough to generate a large amount
of runoff. However, rivers and streams are expected to continue
running high through Wednesday. The best chance for up to
one-quarter inch of rain will be Wednesday afternoon in association
with scattered showers and thunderstorms.
Local emergency management continues to report widespread low-land
flooding near the Bear River, with smaller tributary streams running
high as well. Currently, flooding is mainly affecting low-lying
agricultural areas. Water levels on creeks, streams, and rivers will
remain relatively steady before warmer temperatures the week of May
15, provide the possibility of further rises due to melting snow.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding. Hilly terrain and backcountry roads in the
foothills can be affected by increased stream flows due to snowmelt.
Do not attempt to cross flooded roads. Please report observed
flooding to local emergency services or law enforcement.</description>
