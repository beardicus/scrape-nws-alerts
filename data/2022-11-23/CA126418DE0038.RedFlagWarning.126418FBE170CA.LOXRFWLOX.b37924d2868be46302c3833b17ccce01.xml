<headline>Red Flag Warning issued November 23 at 3:18PM PST until November 25 at 11:00AM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FOR WESTERN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND
EASTERN VENTURA COUNTY MOUNTAINS AND VALLEYS FROM 1 AM THURSDAY
THROUGH 11 AM FRIDAY...
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FOR THE MALIBU COASTAL STRIP
WESTWARD TO THE VENTURA COUNTY COASTAL PLAIN FROM 8 AM THURSDAY
THROUGH 11 AM FRIDAY...
.High confidence in a moderate to strong Santa Ana event ramping
up late tonight, peaking during the morning to early afternoon
hours Thursday, and slowly tapering off into Friday. This Santa
Ana event will be a bit more out of the east than recent events
leading to more of a focus on the western San Fernando Valley and
western portions of the Santa Monica mountains. This orientation
typically provides more widespread gusty winds into coastal areas
of Ventura County as well. Winds will really ramp up after
midnight and peak through Thursday morning with widespread gusts
peaking in the 35 to 55 mph range across much of Los Angeles and
Ventura Counties, including coastal areas. Locally higher gusts of
50 to 65 mph are possible across windier hills and mountains.
Winds will weaken some Thursday afternoon but remaining gusty
through Thursday night with gusts of 30 to 45 mph. Then they will
slowly diminish further through the day on Friday. Humidity levels
will initially start out above critical levels at the onset of
stronger winds this evening, but will lower by Thursday morning as
low as 5 to 15 percent. The combination of these gusty winds and
very low humidity will very likely lead to at least 6 to 12 hours
of widespread critical fire weather conditions.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM THURSDAY TO 11 AM
PST FRIDAY FOR GUSTY NORTHEAST WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY
FOR THE VENTURA COUNTY COASTAL PLAIN AND MALIBU STRIP...
* Winds...Northeast winds 20 to 30 mph with gusts to 50 mph
possible. Strongest Thursday morning.
* Relative Humidity...Humidity levels mostly in the 5 to 15
percent range.
* Impacts...If fire ignition occurs there could be rapid spread
of wildfire that would lead to a threat to life and property.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now, or will shortly. Use extreme caution
with anything that can spark a wildfire. Residents near wildland
interfaces should be prepared to evacuate if a wildfire breaks
out. See readyforwildfire.org and wildfirerisk.org for
information.</instruction>
