<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 845 AM MST FOR
NORTHWESTERN MESA...SOUTHWESTERN GARFIELD AND SOUTHERN RIO BLANCO
COUNTIES...
At 827 AM MST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from 34 miles northwest of Palisade to near Fruita to 13
miles southwest of Grand Junction, moving northeast at 45 mph.
HAZARD...Flash freeze on roads. Intense bursts of heavy snow. Gusty
winds leading to blowing snow and visibility rapidly
falling to less than one-quarter mile. Wind gusts greater
than 35 mph.
SOURCE...Radar and webcams.
IMPACT...Travel will become difficult and potentially dangerous
within minutes.
This includes the following highways...
Interstate 70 in Colorado between mile markers 12 and 43.
U.S. Highway 50 in Colorado between mile markers 32 and 44.

Locations impacted include...
Grand Junction, Fruita, Palisade, Loma, Fruitvale, Clifton, Orchard

be prepared for a sudden loss of traction.
Slow Down! Rapid changes in visibility and road conditions are
expected with this dangerous snow squall. Be alert for sudden
whiteout conditions.
Reduce speed and turn on headlights! During snow squalls, the
visibility may suddenly drop to near zero in whiteout conditions.
