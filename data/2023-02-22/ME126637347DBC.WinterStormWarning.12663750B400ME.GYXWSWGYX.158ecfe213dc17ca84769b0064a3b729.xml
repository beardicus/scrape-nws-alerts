<description>...LOW PRESSURE TO BRING SNOW AND MIXED PRECIPITATION TO THE REGION
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY...
.Low pressure will move from the eastern Great Lakes States on
Wednesday and then across southern New England late Wednesday night
and Thursday. Snow is expected to overspread the area from west to
east Wednesday night and may be heavy at times. Sleet is expected to
mix in late Wednesday night and especially Thursday.
Another period of snow may occur Thursday night into Friday with
more minor accumulations possible.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM THIS EVENING TO
7 PM EST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow and sleet expected. Total snow accumulations
between 7 and 12 inches and sleet accumulations around one quarter
of an inch across the south.
* WHERE...Portions of western Maine. Portions of northern New
Hampshire.
* WHEN...From 7 PM this evening to 7 PM EST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...A snowstorm will bring plowable snow to the region with
a period of moderate travel impacts expected. Periods of moderate
snow and low visibility will be the biggest hazards. The potential
exists for snowbands that will bring periods of locally heavy
snowfall late Wednesday night, which will lead to rapid snow
accumulations and extremely dangerous travel conditions. The
hazardous conditions could impact the Thursday morning commute.</description>
