<headline>Ice Storm Warning issued February 22 at 3:20PM CST until February 23 at 12:00PM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Period of Heavier Accumulations through Late Afternoon...
.At mid-afternoon, radar continues to show widespread
precipitation occurring across the region, with the heaviest
rates seen so far today. Freezing rain, sleet and snow was seen in
northeast Iowa and southwest Wisconsin, with around a tenth of an
inch of ice accumulation. Mainly snow, occasionally mixing with
sleet, is found around the Interstate 90 corridor with 4 to 8
inches received thus far. All snow is found further north of
Interstate 90. Winds are gusting from 30 to 35 mph causing some
drifting, especially on ridgetops and higher terrain.
Though the afternoon commute, expect accumulating ice and snow to
continue with gusty winds. Travel continues to deteriorate.
There will be a period of freezing drizzle near or south of
Interstate 90 during the evening and into the overnight, reducing
the snow accumulations. Light ice accumulations are expected. Snow
will continue north of I-90. Another period of heavier snow will
occur before sunrise west and north of La Crosse.
...ICE STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Significant icing. Occasional sleet. Ice accumulations
of up to three tenths of an inch. Winds gusting as high as 40
mph.
* WHERE...In Iowa, Fayette and Clayton Counties. In Wisconsin,

* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute.</description>
