<headline>High Wind Warning issued February 22 at 12:32AM CST until February 22 at 8:00PM CST by NWS Dodge City</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO 8 PM
CST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Southwest winds 35 to 45 mph with gusts up to 70 mph
expected.
* WHERE...Morton and Stevens Counties.
* WHEN...From 1 PM this afternoon to 8 PM CST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Damaging winds may blow down trees and power lines.
Some power outages are possible. Travel will be difficult,
especially for high profile vehicles.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Given the ongoing drought, widespread
blowing dust is expected where winds materialize, significantly
reducing visibility.</description>
<instruction>The Kansas Department of Health and Environment recommends that
you take preventative measures during this blowing dust
event...such as staying indoors or wearing protective breathing
masks if outside. High dust concentrations can cause respiratory
problems...decrease lung activity...aggravate asthma...and lead
to potential heart-related problems...especially with
children...elderly...or those with pre-existing respiratory
conditions.
People should avoid being outside in forested areas and around
trees and branches. If possible, remain in the lower levels of
your home during the windstorm, and avoid windows. Use caution if
you must drive.</instruction>
