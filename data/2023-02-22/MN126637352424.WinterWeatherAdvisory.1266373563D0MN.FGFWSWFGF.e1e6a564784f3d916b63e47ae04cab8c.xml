minutes.

combine to create very difficult to impossible travel
conditions. Travel will be life-threatening to those stranded
due to dangerous wind chills and significant drifting. The
heaviest snowfall totals will occur along the tri-state area,
increasing as you progress southward.</description>
<instruction>Travel should be restricted to emergencies only. If you must
travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded,
stay with your vehicle.
