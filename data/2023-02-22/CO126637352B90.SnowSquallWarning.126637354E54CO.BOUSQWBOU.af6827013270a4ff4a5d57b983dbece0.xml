<headline>Snow Squall Warning issued February 22 at 12:56PM MST until February 22 at 1:45PM MST by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Denver Colorado has issued a
* Snow Squall Warning for...
Southeastern Grand County in north central Colorado...
* Until 145 PM MST.
* At 1254 PM MST, a dangerous snow squall was located 7 miles
southwest of Tabernash, or 54 miles west of Denver, moving east at
30 mph.
HAZARD...Flash freeze on roads. Intense bursts of heavy snow and
blowing snow with visibility rapidly falling to less than
one-quarter mile. Wind gusts up to 35 mph.
SOURCE...Radar and webcams.
IMPACT...Dangerous and life-threatening travel conditions are
expected to develop rapidly in the warning area.
This will affect U.S. Highway 40 in Grand County.
Locations impacted include...
Granby, Fraser, Winter Park, Grand Lake, Tabernash and Elkdale.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads,
bridges, and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and
be prepared for a sudden loss of traction.
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.
