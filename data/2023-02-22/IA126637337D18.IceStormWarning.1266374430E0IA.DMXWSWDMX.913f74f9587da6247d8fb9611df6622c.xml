<headline>Ice Storm Warning issued February 22 at 2:54AM CST until February 23 at 12:00PM CST by NWS DesMoines</headline>
<description>...Significant Winter Storm Today Into Thursday...
.A large storm system will produce hazardous winter travel
conditions across central and northern Iowa. Precipitation will
begin this morning and become more widespread by this afternoon
and evening, then taper off by Thursday morning. Heavy snowfall
is likely in far northern Iowa with accumulations pushing eight
inches or more close to the Minnesota and Iowa border. Strong
winds will further aggravate difficult driving conditions by
producing widespread blowing snow and visibility reductions to
near a quarter mile at times, and potentially near blizzard
conditions near the state border. Mixed precipitation types are
more of a concern to the south into central Iowa with a variety
of snow, freezing rain, and sleet all possible. Ice accretions may
approach or exceed a quarter inch over portions of central and
east central Iowa.
...ICE STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM THIS MORNING TO NOON CST
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Significant icing expected. Total snow accumulations of
up to one inch and ice accumulations near to above one quarter
of an inch. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of central Iowa.
* WHEN...From 6 AM this morning to noon CST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Power outages and tree damage are possible due to the
ice. Travel may become difficult. Patchy blowing snow could
significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions could
impact the morning or evening commute.</description>
<instruction>Travel is strongly discouraged. If you must travel, keep an extra
flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case of an
emergency. Prepare for possible power outages.
For the latest travel conditions, check the Iowa 511 app,
www.511ia.org, or dial 511.</instruction>
