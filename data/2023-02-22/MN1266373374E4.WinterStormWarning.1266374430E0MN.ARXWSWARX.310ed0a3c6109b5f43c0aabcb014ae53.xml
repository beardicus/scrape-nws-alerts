<description>...Snow continues north of I-90 for the rest of tonight with a
second round of heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain starting
area-wide by mid-morning...
.Snow persists north of Interstate 90 from southeast Minnesota
into west-central Wisconsin for the remainder of the night and
into the morning hours. Additional snow amounts should be around
1 to 3 inches and confined closer to the Interstate 94 corridor.
The second and stronger wave of snow arrives from south to north
this morning across the entire area. By the time the storm ends
Thursday morning, an additional 8 to 12 inches of snow is

the best potential for hazardous icing conditions being across
northeast Iowa and southwest Wisconsin. Ice amounts from a tenth
to four tenths of an inch are expected along and south of the
