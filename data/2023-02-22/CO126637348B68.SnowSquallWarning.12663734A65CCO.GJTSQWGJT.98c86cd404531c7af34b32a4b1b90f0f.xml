<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 915 AM MST FOR NORTH
CENTRAL MESA AND SOUTH CENTRAL GARFIELD COUNTIES...
At 901 AM MST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from 30 miles west of Rifle to 12 miles west of Parachute
to near De Beque to near Palisade, moving northeast at 45 mph.
HAZARD...Flash freeze on roads. Intense bursts of heavy snow. Gusty
winds leading to blowing snow and visibility rapidly
falling to less than one-quarter mile. Wind gusts greater
than 50 mph could knock down tree limbs and blow around
unsecured objects.
SOURCE...Radar and webcams.
IMPACT...Travel will become difficult and potentially dangerous
within minutes.
This includes the following highways...
Interstate 70 in Colorado between mile markers 37 and 41, and
between mile markers 45 and 78.
Colorado 65 between mile markers 51 and 61.
Locations impacted include...
Parachute, De Beque, Battlement Mesa, Cameo and Clifton.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads,
bridges, and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and
be prepared for a sudden loss of traction.
Slow Down! Rapid changes in visibility and road conditions are
expected with this dangerous snow squall. Be alert for sudden
whiteout conditions.
Reduce speed and turn on headlights! During snow squalls, the
visibility may suddenly drop to near zero in whiteout conditions.
