<headline>Snow Squall Warning issued February 22 at 12:48PM MST until February 22 at 1:45PM MST by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Denver Colorado has issued a
* Snow Squall Warning for...
Summit County in central Colorado...
Southeastern Grand County in north central Colorado...
Southwestern Clear Creek County in central Colorado...
* Until 145 PM MST.
* At 1247 PM MST, a dangerous snow squall was located 4 miles north
of Vail Pass, or 60 miles east of Glenwood Springs, moving
northeast at 35 mph.
HAZARD...Flash freeze on roads. Intense bursts of heavy snow and
blowing snow with visibility rapidly falling to less than
one-quarter mile. Wind gusts up to 35 mph.
SOURCE...Radar and webcams.
IMPACT...Dangerous and life-threatening travel conditions are
expected to develop rapidly in the warning area.
This includes Interstate 70 between mile markers 190 and 221.
Locations impacted include...
Breckenridge, Silverthorne, Frisco, Dillon, Bakerville, Vail Pass,
Keystone, Loveland Pass and Copper Mountain.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads,
bridges, and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and
be prepared for a sudden loss of traction.
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.
