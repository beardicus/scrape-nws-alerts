<description>...LOW PRESSURE TO BRING SNOW AND MIXED PRECIPITATION TO THE REGION
TONIGHT AND THURSDAY...
.Low pressure will move across southern New England late tonight and
Thursday. Snow is expected to overspread the area from west to east
tonight and may be heavy at times overnight into early Thursday
morning. Sleet may mix in late tonight and Thursday morning, mainly
across southern New Hampshire.
Another period of snow or mixed precipitation may occur Thursday
night into early Friday with more minor accumulations possible.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow. Additional snow accumulations between 7 and 10
inches for a storm total of 7 to 10 inches.
* WHERE...Portions of western Maine. Portions of northern New
Hampshire.
* WHEN...Until 7 PM EST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...A snowstorm will bring plowable snow to the region with
a period of moderate travel impacts expected. Periods of moderate
snow and low visibility will be the biggest hazards. The potential
exists for snowbands that will bring periods of locally heavy
snowfall, which will lead to rapid snow accumulations and
extremely dangerous travel conditions. Periods of moderate and
heavy snow will combine with low visibility to create dangerous
driving conditions. The hazardous conditions could impact the
Thursday morning and evening commutes.</description>
