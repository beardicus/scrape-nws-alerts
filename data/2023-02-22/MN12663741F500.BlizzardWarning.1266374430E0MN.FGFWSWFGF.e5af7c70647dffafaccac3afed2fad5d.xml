high as 40 mph. Dangerously cold wind chills as low as 40
below zero.
* WHERE...Portions of west central Minnesota and southeast North
Dakota.
* WHEN...For the Blizzard Warning, until noon CST Thursday. For
the Winter Weather Advisory, until 3 PM CST this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be very difficult to impossible.
Widespread blowing snow will significantly reduce visibility.
The hazardous conditions will impact the morning or evening
commute. The dangerously cold wind chills as low as 40 below
zero will cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10
minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Accumulating snow and blowing snow will
combine to create very difficult to impossible travel
conditions. Travel will be life-threatening to those stranded
due to dangerous wind chills and significant drifting. The
heaviest snowfall totals will occur along the tri-state area,
increasing as you progress southward.</description>
<instruction>Travel should be restricted to emergencies only. If you must
travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded,
stay with your vehicle.
