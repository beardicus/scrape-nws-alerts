<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued February 22 at 11:50AM CST until February 23 at 12:00PM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Second round of heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain...
.This early afternoon the heavy snowband that moved into the
region from the south is along I-90. Visibilities have been less
than 1 mile at times under the heaviest band. HREF guidance remains
consistent keeping the higher accumulating rates along this
corridor through the afternoon, but the signal for 1 inch rates
have weakened. Heading into the evening the snowfall is
anticipated to spread further northward and fill across northeast
Iowa and southwest Wisconsin. Strong winds gusting up to 40 mph
combined with the falling snow could lead to whiteout conditions
especially in open areas. Sleet and freezing rain have been
reported for locations in far southwest Wisconsin through central
Iowa. Ice accumulations near 1/4 of an inch are still possible for
locations south of highway 18. This will be a HIGHLY impactful
winter storm with travel severely affected at times.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation. Additional snow
accumulations of 9 to 12 inches and ice accumulations of a
light glaze. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of southeast Minnesota and central, north
central and west central Wisconsin.
* WHEN...Until noon CST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Areas
of blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
