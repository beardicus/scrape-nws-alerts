<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM AKST THIS
EVENING...
...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM THIS EVENING THROUGH
THURSDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...For the Winter Weather Advisory, Blowing snow with poor

* WHEN...For the Winter Weather Advisory, until 9 PM AKST this

* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The dangerously
cold wind chills as low as 45 below zero could cause frostbite

drifts will develop impacting travel in the area.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Wind chill values will moderate this
morning as temperatures rise. Winds will diminish some this
afternoon and increase in the evening.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
A Winter Storm Watch for blizzard conditions means there is a
potential for falling and/or blowing snow with strong winds and
extremely poor visibilities. This can lead to whiteout conditions
and make travel very difficult.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
