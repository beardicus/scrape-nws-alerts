<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued February 22 at 6:11AM CST until February 23 at 12:00PM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Second round of heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain arriving
from the south...
.The next wave of snow arrives from south to north this morning
and persists through the rest of today and tonight, ending from
southwest to northeast during the morning on Thursday. Strong
winds gusting to 30 to 40 mph combined with the falling snow will
lead to reduced visibilities and possibly whiteout conditions in
open areas. By the time the storm ends, an additional 8 to 12
inches of snow is expected northwest of an Austin, Minnesota to
Necedah, Wisconsin line.
Sleet and freezing rain may mix with the snow at times, with the
best potential for hazardous icing conditions being across
northeast Iowa and southwest Wisconsin. Ice amounts from a tenth
to four tenths of an inch are expected along and south of the
Highway 18 corridor through tonight. This ice brings with it the
risk of tree and power line damage amplified by winds gusting to
30 to 40 mph.
This will be a HIGHLY impactful winter storm with travel severely
affected at times.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow, occasionally mixed with sleet and freezing
rain. Total snow accumulations of 9 to 12 inches and ice
accumulations of a light glaze. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of southeast Minnesota and central, north
central and west central Wisconsin.
* WHEN...As the overnight snow weakens early this morning, a new
round of heavy snow overspreads the region by mid to late
morning and persists through late morning on Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Areas
of blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
