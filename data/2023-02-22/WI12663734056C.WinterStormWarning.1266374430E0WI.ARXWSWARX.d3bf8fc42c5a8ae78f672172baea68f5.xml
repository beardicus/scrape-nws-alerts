<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued February 22 at 6:03AM CST until February 23 at 12:00PM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Second round of heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain arriving
from the south...
.The next wave of snow arrives from south to north this morning
and persists through the rest of today and tonight, ending from
southwest to northeast during the morning on Thursday. Strong
winds gusting to 30 to 40 mph combined with the falling snow will
lead to reduced visibilities and possibly whiteout conditions in
open areas. By the time the storm ends, an additional 8 to 12
inches of snow is expected northwest of an Austin, Minnesota to
Necedah, Wisconsin line.
Sleet and freezing rain may mix with the snow at times, with the
best potential for hazardous icing conditions being across
northeast Iowa and southwest Wisconsin. Ice amounts from a tenth
to four tenths of an inch are expected along and south of the
Highway 18 corridor through tonight. This ice brings with it the
risk of tree and power line damage amplified by winds gusting to
30 to 40 mph.
This will be a HIGHLY impactful winter storm with travel severely
affected at times.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation expected. Total snow
accumulations of 3 to 6 inches and ice accumulations of up to
one tenth of an inch. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of north central and northeast Iowa and
southwest Wisconsin.
* WHEN...The greatest risk of accumulating ice and snow will be
from this morning through early tonight, with strong winds
lingering through Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Patchy blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
