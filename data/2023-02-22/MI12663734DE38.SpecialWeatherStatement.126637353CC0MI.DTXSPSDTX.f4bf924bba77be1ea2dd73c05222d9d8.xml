<description>...VERY DIFFICULT TRAVEL CONDITIONS THIS AFTERNOON AS WINTRY MIX
TRANSITIONING TO FREEZING RAIN CONTINUES...
WEATHER...
* A wintry mix of sleet and freezing rain will transition to
primarily freezing rain across areas along and south of the
I-94 corridor through the early afternoon. Periods of moderate
intensity freezing rain will be possible through the early afternoon
hours, along with pockets of sleet and snow mixing in at
times. Temperatures attempting to warm above freezing near the
Ohio border may result in rain mixing in at times south of
M-50.
* Ice accretion up to a tenth of an inch will be possible through
3 PM, with locally higher amounts possible, especially across
portions of Wayne and Washtenaw counties, and higher elevation
areas of Lenawee county. Accretion will be most prevalent on
elevated surfaces, but will become increasingly common on
untreated roadways, bridges, exit ramps, overpasses, and other
untreated surfaces such as sidewalks and parking lots.
* Northeast winds will occasionally gust up to 25 mph.
* Air temperatures will hover around 32 degrees.
IMPACTS...
* Moderate icing may lead to slippery roads particularly on
bridges, exit ramps and overpasses. Treated roads may become
difficult to travel in areas where heavier ice accretion rates
occur.
&amp;&amp;
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
* Motorists are urged to use caution and account for variable
driving conditions by slowing down and allowing extra time.
Expect very difficult hazardous travel conditions.
* Prepare, plan and stay informed. Visit http://go.usa.gov/c7kkP</description>
