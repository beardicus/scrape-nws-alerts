<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued February 22 at 2:33AM CST until February 23 at 12:00PM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Snow continues north of I-90 for the rest of tonight with a
second round of heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain starting
area-wide by mid-morning...
.Snow persists north of Interstate 90 from southeast Minnesota
into west-central Wisconsin for the remainder of the night and
into the morning hours. Additional snow amounts should be around
1 to 3 inches and confined closer to the Interstate 94 corridor.
The second and stronger wave of snow arrives from south to north
this morning across the entire area. By the time the storm ends
Thursday morning, an additional 8 to 12 inches of snow is
expected northwest of an Austin, Minnesota to Necedah, Wisconsin
line.
Sleet and freezing rain may mix in with the snow at times, with
the best potential for hazardous icing conditions being across
northeast Iowa and southwest Wisconsin. Ice amounts from a tenth
to four tenths of an inch are expected along and south of the
Highway 18 corridor through tonight. This ice brings with it the
risk of tree and power line damage amplified by winds gusting to
30 to 40 mph.
This will be a HIGHLY impactful winter storm with travel severely
impacted at times.
