<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM PST
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 4
inches, except 4 to 14 inches west of Highway 395. Winds
gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Lassen-Eastern Plumas-Eastern Sierra Counties.
* WHEN...From noon today to 4 AM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible,
including the morning and evening commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...There may be big differences in snow
totals over short distances due to the showery nature of the
storms. Showers will be most prevalent in the afternoon hours
today and again midday Thursday through Thursday night.</description>
<instruction>Even light snowfall causes major travel delays, especially during
periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to
reach your destination. Leave extra space between vehicles since
it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
