<headline>Ice Storm Warning issued February 22 at 11:50AM CST until February 23 at 12:00PM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Second round of heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain...
.This early afternoon the heavy snowband that moved into the
region from the south is along I-90. Visibilities have been less
than 1 mile at times under the heaviest band. HREF guidance remains
consistent keeping the higher accumulating rates along this
corridor through the afternoon, but the signal for 1 inch rates
have weakened. Heading into the evening the snowfall is
anticipated to spread further northward and fill across northeast
Iowa and southwest Wisconsin. Strong winds gusting up to 40 mph
combined with the falling snow could lead to whiteout conditions
especially in open areas. Sleet and freezing rain have been
reported for locations in far southwest Wisconsin through central
Iowa. Ice accumulations near 1/4 of an inch are still possible for
locations south of highway 18. This will be a HIGHLY impactful
winter storm with travel severely affected at times.
...ICE STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Significant icing. Additional snow accumulations of up to
two inches and ice accumulations of one tenth to three tenths of
an inch. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...In Iowa, Fayette and Clayton Counties. In Wisconsin,
Grant County.
* WHEN...Until noon CST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Power outages and tree damage are possible due to the
ice. Travel could be nearly impossible. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute.</description>
<instruction>Travel is strongly discouraged. If you must travel, keep an extra
flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case of an
emergency. Prepare for possible power outages.
In Iowa, visit 511ia.org for road conditions. In Wisconsin,
visit 511wi.gov for road conditions.</instruction>
