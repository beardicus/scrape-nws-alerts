<headline>Flood Watch issued March 22 at 4:22AM CDT  by NWS Houston - Galveston</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM CDT THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of southeast Texas, including the following
areas, Coastal Harris, Grimes, Houston, Inland Harris, Madison,
Montgomery, Northern Liberty, Polk, San Jacinto, Southern Liberty,
Trinity, Walker and Waller.
* WHEN...Until 9 AM CDT this morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. If you are on
the road for your morning commute please be on the lookout for
flooded roadways and do not attempt to cross any flooded roads
that you encounter.  It is very difficult to judge the depth of
the water at night.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A cold front will continue to move through the watch area
bringing a band of showers and thunderstorms...some with
locally heavy rainfall. Rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per
hour will be possible. With this slow moving cold front will
come the possibility of 2 to 4 inches of rain in some
localized areas with isolated higher amounts.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
