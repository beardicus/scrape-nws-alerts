        <headline>Flood Advisory issued July 15 at 8:22PM EDT until July 15 at 11:15PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg SC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...Nuisance flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.

* WHERE...A portion of northwestern Iredell County, North Carolina

* WHEN...Until 1115 PM EDT.

* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks,
greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and
parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.
A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.  A
small culvert washout or two is possible.


* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 822 PM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicate heavy rain in ongoing between near Central due to
multiple slow-moving thunderstorms.  A rain gauge near Pisgah
Ridge Cir has reported 3.5 inches of rainfall over the past
60-75 minutes.  Rainfall rates are decreasing; however, this
heaviest rainfall was enough to produce excessive runoff into
area streams, primarily Outz Creek, Buck Creek, and Snow
Creek, as well as adjacent feeder streams and drainages.
Significant rises on these streams is beginning and will
likely continue over the next 30-90 minutes.  Bankfull
conditions are likely, with areas of nuisance flooding
developing.

Areas of greatest concern include:
1) Along Outz Creek near Laurel Creek Rd and Pisgah Ridge Cir
2) Snow Creek near Bowles Farm Rd, Fox Bottoms Rd, and Eagles
Nest Ln
3) Buck Branch near Cattlemans Rd
4) Snow Creek near Bailey Farm Rd.

- Significant additional rainfall is not expected.  However,
routed flow resulting from the heavy rain upstream may impact
downstream areas of Snow Creek, generally near and east of NC
115, including Bailey Farm Rd.  It may take another 60-90
minutes for high flows to reach these areas.  Do not become
complacent and stay stream aware through 10pm.

- Some locations that may experience nuisance flooding
include...
mainly rural areas of Northwestern Iredell County

        <instruction>Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.

In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
