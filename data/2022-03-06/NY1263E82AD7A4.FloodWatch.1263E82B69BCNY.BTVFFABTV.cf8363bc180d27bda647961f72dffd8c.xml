<headline>Flood Watch issued March 06 at 1:41PM EST  by NWS Burlington</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM EST THIS EVENING THROUGH TUESDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by river ice movement due to rain and
snowmelt and/or ice jams is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of northern New York and Vermont, including the
following counties, in northern New York, Clinton and Essex. In
Vermont, Caledonia, Addison, Chittenden, Franklin, Essex,
Lamoille, Orange, Orleans, Washington.
* WHEN...From 7 PM EST this evening through Tuesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations,
mainly due to river ice movement and the potential for ice jam
formation.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The combination of mild temperatures, light to moderate
rainfall and snowmelt will lead to modest rises on area
streams and rivers. While widespread flooding is not
expected, forecast rises of 2 to 5 feet may be enough to
break up any thin river ice that has developed over recent
cold spells, particularly on central and northern rivers such
as the Au Sable, Winooski, Lamoille, Missisquoi and
Passumpsic. This could lead to the formation of ice jams on
these waterways, and/or foster sharper rises in the vicinity
of existing jams.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
