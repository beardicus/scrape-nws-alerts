<senderName>NWS El Paso (Southern New Mexico and extreme Western Texas)</senderName>
<headline>Red Flag Warning issued March 06 at 7:09AM CST until March 06 at 8:00PM CST by NWS El Paso</headline>
<description>...ELEVATED TO NEAR CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS SUNDAY
AFTERNOON...
.A weather system passing north of the area on Sunday will
generate strong west winds over the area, resulting in 20-foot
wind speeds in the 20 to 30 mph range by the afternoon. Very dry
conditions persist with relative humidity values across the desert
lowlands to be in the lower to middle teens. These conditions
will result in high fire danger that will allow fires to spread
quickly. Cooler temperatures behind a passing cold front will
slightly lower the threat. Humidity values in the mountains will
be higher and will lessen fire danger chances to below critical
thresholds. Far western area will also see lower winds and lesser
chances for critical fire weather conditions.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO 7 PM MST
THIS EVENING FOR STRONG WINDS, LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY, AND HIGH
FIRE DANGER...
* AFFECTED AREA...Fire weather zones 111 and 112 in southwest
and south central New Mexico. Fire weather zone 055 and 056 in
far west Texas. Stronger winds and more elevated fire weather
conditions are expected over lowlands east of the Rio Grande
valley.
* WIND...East of the Rio Grande Valley, west to southwest winds
of 20 to 30 mph with gusts up to 50 mph. West of the Rio Grande
valley, west winds of 15 to 30 mph with gust to 40 mph.
* HUMIDITY...13 to 17 percent
* HIGHEST THREAT...is located across the lowlands east of the
Rio Grande valley, including Hudspeth and Otero counties,
where the relative humidity will be lower, winds will be
stronger, and temperatures will be warmer.
* IMPACTS...any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly.
Outdoor burning is not recommended. Be careful with producing
sparks outdoors.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now, or will shortly. A combination of
strong winds, low relative humidity, and warm temperatures can
contribute to extreme fire behavior.</instruction>
