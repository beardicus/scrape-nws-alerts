<headline>Flood Watch issued May 25 at 12:39PM MDT until further notice by NWS GrandJunction</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Grand Junction CO has issued a
Flood Watch for the following rivers in Colorado...
Plateau Creek near Cameo affecting Grand and Battlement Mesas and
Debeque to Silt Corridor.
.Warm temperatures will continue to melt snowpack and increase river
flows. In addition, Vega Reservoir is expected to reach full
capacity, utilizing the overflow spillway, which will increase flow
down Plateau Creek.</description>
<instruction>If you are in the watch area, remain alert to possible flooding.
Residents and those recreating along or near the creek should
monitor rising water levels and be prepared for possible flood
warnings.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
