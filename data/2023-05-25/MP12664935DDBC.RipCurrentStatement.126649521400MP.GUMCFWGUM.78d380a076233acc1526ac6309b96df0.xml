<description>...HIGH SURF WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 FRIDAY ALONG SOUTH
AND WEST FACING REEFS...
...HIGH RISK OF RIP CURRENTS THROUGH FRIDAY AFTERNOON...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking waves of
10 to 15 feet in the surf zone along south and west facing
reefs. Expect life-threatening rip currents. For the Coastal
Flood Warning, significant coastal flooding and erosion is
likely due to high surf from Mawar.
* WHERE...Saipan and Tinian.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Warning and High Rip Current Risk,
until 6 PM Friday. For the Coastal Flood Warning, until 6 PM
this evening.
* IMPACTS...Breaking waves can sweep people off jetties and
docks, and into dangerous seas. Life-threatening swimming
conditions and significant beach erosion can be expected.
Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore
into deeper water. Shoreline erosion will occur along with the
possibility of inundation for coastal properties.</description>
<instruction>Stay out of the water.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of piers and other waterside
infrastructure.
Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.</instruction>
