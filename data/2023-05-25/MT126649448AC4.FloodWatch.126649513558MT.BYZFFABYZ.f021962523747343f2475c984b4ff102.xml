<headline>Flood Watch issued May 25 at 1:29PM MDT  by NWS Billings</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH FRIDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of central, south central, and southeast Montana,
including the following areas, in central Montana, Musselshell. In
south central Montana, Northeastern Yellowstone, Northern Big
Horn, Southern Big Horn, Southwestern Yellowstone and Treasure. In
southeast Montana, Carter, Custer, Fallon, Northern Rosebud,
Powder River and Southern Rosebud.
* WHEN...Through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.
Storm drains and ditches may become clogged with debris. Extensive
street flooding and flooding of creeks and rivers is possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Heavy rainfall the last few days has likely saturated soils
at many locations in the watch area. The risk of
thunderstorms with torrential rainfall rates over ground that
is already saturated will increase the risk of flash flood
issues through at least Friday evening. This watch may need
to be extended into the weekend as well.
