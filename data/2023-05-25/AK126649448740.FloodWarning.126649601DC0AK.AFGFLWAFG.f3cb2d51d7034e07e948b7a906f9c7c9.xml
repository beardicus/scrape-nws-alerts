<description>...FLOOD WARNING FOR AN ICE JAM IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM AKDT FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam is expected.
* WHERE...The Yukon River near Marshall to Mountain Village,
including the villages of Pilot Station and St. Mary`s.
* WHEN...Until 400 PM AKDT Friday.
* IMPACTS...An ice jam about 25 mi downstream of Russian Mission has
released and is likely to release water to communities downstream
of the jam. River levels are expected to continue to rise as
impounded high water behind these ice jams continues to push
downstream, likely leading to flooding down to Mountain Village.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1102 AM AKDT, An ice jam upstream of Pilot Station
released Wednesday night causing water levels to rise 4 feet
in Pilot Station with bank-to-bank tightly packed ice and
river levels approaching homes near the bank. Water levels
have also risen rapidly over night and into this morning in
Marshall, St. Mary`s and Mountain Village.  Residents in
these locations should be prepared for a long period of high
water even after the ice jams release.

Village stay alert and be prepared to take action.</description>
