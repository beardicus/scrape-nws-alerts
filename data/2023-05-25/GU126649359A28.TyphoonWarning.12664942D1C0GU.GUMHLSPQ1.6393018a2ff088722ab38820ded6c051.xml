<headline>Typhoon Warning issued May 25 at 7:38AM ChST until further notice by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>.NEW INFORMATION...
Tropical Storm Warning and Typhoon Watch have been cancelled for
Tinian and Saipan.
.AREAS AFFECTED...
This local statement provides important information and
recommended actions for people in Guam and the Northern Marianas.
.Watches/Warnings...
A Typhoon Warning continues for Guam and Rota. Typhoon force
winds of 74 mph are slowly subsiding.
A Tropical Storm Warning and a Typhoon Watch has been cancelled for
Saipan and Tinian.
A Flood Watch remains in effect for Guam. Please listen closely for
any Flood Warnings that might be in effect for your area.
.STORM INFORMATION...
At 4 AM ChST...the center of Typhoon Mawar (02W) was located near
latitude 14.1N...longitude 144.1E. This was about 65 miles north-
northwest of Guam and 75 miles west of Rota. Storm motion was
northwest at 8 mph. Storm intensity was 140 mph.
.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
The center of Mawar has left the Marianas waters, but strong winds
remain over the area on the scale of strong tropical storm force
winds. Winds remain strong over the region with coastal areas still
under threat from inundation. Significant coastal erosion is likely,
particularly along western shorelines. Flood watch is still in
effect.
.PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
You should be in a fully-reinforced concrete structure, especially on
Guam.
Stay inside and away from windows. Do not venture outside when high
winds are occurring or during temporary lulls as flying debris can
easily, and suddenly, cause serious injury.
Have a well-charged cell phone nearby, keeping network communications
as open as possible for emergencies.
Once conditions have improved, remain in shelter until the all-clear,
COR 4, is announced from government officials.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for the latest forecasts.
...TYPHOON WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT...
...New Information...
Mawar is northwest of Guam and pulling away from the Marianas. Mawar`s
current location puts the risk of highest surf along west and north
facing reefs.
...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Residents should remain in shelter within sturdy concrete homes with
concrete roofs, or wherever you are.
Again, once conditions have improved sometime late Thursday or
Friday, remain in shelter until the all-clear, Cor 4, is given by
government officials.
&amp;&amp;
...Winds...
Typhoon force winds have eased to tropical storm conditions this
morning. Tropical storm conditions may persist into the afternoon.
Exposed, higher terrain of the island is likely to experience higher
winds. The island can expect continued tropical storm winds shifting
south-southwest to south to southeast today.
When the all-clear is given and you leave shelters, use caution as
there will be debris in the roads, power lines down, possible
hazardous material scattered around the island. Wear protective
clothing and footwear to help avoid injury.
...Storm surge and storm tide...
West/North Coastal Areas:
Storm surge has decreased and will continue to subside as Mawar
continues to move away from Guam.
Eastern Guam:
Storm surge is no longer expected for southeastern Guam around
Inalahan up to Pago/Mangilao.
Dangerous surf persists along western and northern coastlines as a
large north swell generated by Mawar affects these shorelines.
...Inland flooding...
A Flood Watch remains in effect for Guam until late this morning.
Showers are decreasing across the island. However, due to the amount
of rainfall on the island, minor flash flooding remains a
possibility. Listen for possible flood warnings, and be ready to act
if flooding rains occur.
Additional rainfall of 1 to 3 inches of rain is possible the next
few hours as Mawar moves away. Monitor conditions for possible
flood advisories or warnings.</description>
