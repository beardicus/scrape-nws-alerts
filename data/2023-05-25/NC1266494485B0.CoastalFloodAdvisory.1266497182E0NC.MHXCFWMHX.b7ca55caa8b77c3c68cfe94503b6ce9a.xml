Advisory, large breaking waves of 4 to 8 feet expected in the
surf zone.
* WHERE...East Carteret County.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, until 8 PM EDT this
evening. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 10 AM Friday to
10 AM EDT Sunday. For the High Surf Advisory, from 5 PM Friday
to 8 PM EDT Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only isolated
road closures expected. Dangerous swimming and surfing
conditions and localized beach erosion. Strong longshore
currents will create dangerous swimming conditions.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
