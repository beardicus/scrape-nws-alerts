<headline>High Surf Warning issued May 25 at 12:10PM ChST until May 26 at 6:00PM ChST by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM CHST FRIDAY...
...HIGH RISK OF RIP CURRENTS THROUGH FRIDAY AFTERNOON...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IS CANCELLED...
* WHAT...High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking waves of 10
to 15 feet in the surf zone along south and west facing reefs.
Expect life-threatening rip currents.
* WHERE...Guam and Rota Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Warning, until 6 PM ChST Friday. For
the High Rip Current Risk, through Friday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Breaking waves can sweep people off jetties and
docks, and into dangerous seas. Life-threatening swimming
conditions and significant beach erosion can be expected. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water. Shoreline erosion will occur along with the
possibility of inundation for coastal properties.</description>
<instruction>Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other waterside
infrastructure.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
