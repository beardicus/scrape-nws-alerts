<description>...SUPER TYPHOON MAWAR CONTINUES TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE MARIANAS...
.NEW INFORMATION...
Super Typhoon Mawar continues to moves west away from the Marianas.
.AREAS AFFECTED...
This local statement provides important information and
recommended actions for people in Guam and the Northern Marianas.
.Watches/Warnings...
A Typhoon Warning continues for the following locations, Guam and
Rota.
Please check the latest public and marine forecasts for detailed
information about additional hazards.
.STORM INFORMATION...
At 1 PM ChST...the center of Super Typhoon Mawar (02W) was
located near LATITUDE 14.4N...LONGITUDE 143.0E. This was about
110 miles west-northwest OF Guam. Storm Motion was
west-northwest. Storm Intensity was 150 mph.
.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
The center of Mawar has left the Marianas waters, but strong winds
remain over the area on the scale of tropical storm force winds.
Flood watch is still in effect.
.PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Stay inside and away from windows. Do not venture outside when high
winds are occurring or during temporary lulls as flying debris can
easily, and suddenly, cause serious injury.
Have a well-charged cell phone nearby, keeping network communications
as open as possible for emergencies.
Once conditions have improved, remain in shelter until the all-clear,
COR 4, is announced from government officials.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for the latest forecasts.
&amp;&amp;
.NEXT UPDATE...
The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather
Service in Tiyan around 8 PM ChST...or sooner if conditions
warrant.
...Typhoon Warning remains in effect...
...Flood Watch remains in effect...
...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Residents should remain in shelter within sturdy concrete homes with
concrete roofs, or wherever you are.
Again, once conditions have improved sometime late Thursday or
Friday, remain in shelter until the all-clear, Cor 4, is given by
government officials.
&amp;&amp;
...Winds...
Typhoon force winds have eased to tropical storm conditions this
afternoon. Tropical storm conditions may persist into the evening.
Exposed, higher terrain of the island is likely to experience higher
winds. The island can expect continued tropical storm winds shifting
south-southwest to south to southeast today.
When the all-clear is given and you leave shelters, use caution as
there will be debris in the roads, power lines down, possible
hazardous material scattered around the island. Wear protective
clothing and footwear to help avoid injury.
...Inland flooding...
A Flood Watch remains in effect for Guam until this evening.
Showers are decreasing across the island. However, due to the amount
of rainfall on the island, minor flash flooding remains a
possibility. Listen for possible flood warnings, and be ready to act
if flooding rains occur.
Additional rainfall of 1 to 3 inches of rain is possible the next
few hours as Mawar moves away. Monitor conditions for possible
flood advisories or warnings.</description>
