<description>.NEW INFORMATION...
Tropical Storm Warning and Typhoon Watch have been cancelled for
Tinian and Saipan.
.AREAS AFFECTED...
This local statement provides important information and
recommended actions for people in Guam and the Northern Marianas.
.Watches/Warnings...
A Typhoon Warning continues for Guam and Rota. Typhoon force
winds of 74 mph are slowly subsiding.
A Tropical Storm Warning and a Typhoon Watch has been cancelled for
Saipan and Tinian.
A Flood Watch remains in effect for Guam. Please listen closely for
any Flood Warnings that might be in effect for your area.
.STORM INFORMATION...
At 4 AM ChST...the center of Typhoon Mawar (02W) was located near
latitude 14.1N...longitude 144.1E. This was about 65 miles north-
northwest of Guam and 75 miles west of Rota. Storm motion was
northwest at 8 mph. Storm intensity was 140 mph.
.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
The center of Mawar has left the Marianas waters, but strong winds
remain over the area on the scale of strong tropical storm force
winds. Winds remain strong over the region with coastal areas still
under threat from inundation. Significant coastal erosion is likely,
particularly along western shorelines. Flood watch is still in
effect.
.PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
You should be in a fully-reinforced concrete structure, especially on
Guam.
Stay inside and away from windows. Do not venture outside when high
winds are occurring or during temporary lulls as flying debris can
easily, and suddenly, cause serious injury.
Have a well-charged cell phone nearby, keeping network communications
as open as possible for emergencies.
Once conditions have improved, remain in shelter until the all-clear,
COR 4, is announced from government officials.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for the latest forecasts.
...TYPHOON WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...FLOOD WATCH IS NO LONGER IN EFFECT...
...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Residents should remain in shelter within sturdy concrete homes with
concrete roofs, or wherever you are.
Again, once conditions have improved sometime later today, remain in
shelter until the all-clear, Cor 4, is given by government officials.
&amp;&amp;
...Winds...
Mawar is drifting west. Tropical storm winds will be from the
southeast, with winds decreasing through the day.
When the all-clear is given and you leave shelters, use caution as
there will be debris in the roads, power lines down, possible
hazardous material scattered around the island. Wear protective
clothing and footwear to help avoid injury.
...Storm surge and storm tide...
Storm surge is decreasing as Mawar moves away from the Marianas.
However, surf will remain dangerous, especially along southern and
western shorelines.
...Inland flooding...
A Flood Watch is no longer in effect for Rota. Showers have
decreased significantly over Rota.
Heavy rainfall may develop later this morning into early afternoon.
Rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches are possible. Monitor conditions
for possible flood advisories or warnings.</description>
