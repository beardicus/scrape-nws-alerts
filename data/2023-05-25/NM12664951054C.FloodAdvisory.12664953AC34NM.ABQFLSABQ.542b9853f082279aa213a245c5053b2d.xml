<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 1015 PM MDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Arroyo and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Portions of east central and northeast New Mexico,
including the following counties, in east central New Mexico,
Quay. In northeast New Mexico, Harding and San Miguel.
* WHEN...Until 1015 PM MDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
Rises in small streams and normally dry arroyos. Dangerous flows
over low-water crossings.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 703 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms. This will cause arroyo and small stream
flooding. Up to 1.5 inches of rain have fallen. Additional
rainfall amounts up to 1.5 inches are expected over the area.
The potential exists for flash flooding to develop.
- Hazardous water levels are expected in Ute Creek, Montesita
Creek, and the Canadian River downstream to Ute Lake.  This
area received 1 to 4 inches of rain and copious amounts of
hail yesterday, so hazardous runoff will develop very quickly
today.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Logan and Ute Lake State Park.
- This includes the following highways...
State Road 104 between Mile Markers 97 and 101.
