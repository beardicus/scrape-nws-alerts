<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT TUESDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Up to 3 feet of storm surge is expected around the time
of high tide Tuesday afternoon. This will combine with high
astronomical tides and building seas to produce the threat of
minor to moderate coastal flooding around the time of high
tide.
* WHERE...Coastal Hancock and Coastal Washington Counties.
* WHEN...Tuesday afternoon around the time of high tide. High
tide at Bar Harbor is at 1:27 p.m. and at Machias is at 1:36
p.m.
* IMPACTS...Roads along the shoreline may be flooded and closed.
Low-lying property including homes, businesses, and some
critical infrastructure may experience minor to moderate
flooding around the time of high tide. This includes Machias.
Shoreline erosion is likely at locations such as Rogue Bluffs.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
