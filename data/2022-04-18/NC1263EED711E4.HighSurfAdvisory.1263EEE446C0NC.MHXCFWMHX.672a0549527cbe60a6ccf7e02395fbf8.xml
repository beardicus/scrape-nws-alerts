<headline>High Surf Advisory issued April 18 at 9:45AM EDT until April 18 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, 1 to 2 feet of
inundation above ground level expected in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways. For the High Surf Advisory,
large breaking waves of 6 to 8 feet expected in the surf zone.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents and
strong longshore currents in the surf zone.
* WHERE...East Carteret County.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT this
evening. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 7 PM EDT this
evening. For the Beach Hazards Statement, until 8 PM EDT this
evening.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Dangerous swimming and
surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip currents
can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper
water. Strong longshore currents will create dangerous
swimming conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most likely time for strong rip
currents to occur is a couple hours either side of low tide,
which will occur around 3 PM today.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
