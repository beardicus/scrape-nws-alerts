<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued September 01 at 11:18AM EDT until September 01 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EDT TONIGHT...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EDT
TONIGHT...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IS CANCELLED...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to 2 feet of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking
waves of 7 to 10 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards
Statement, dangerous rip currents, large breaking waves, and
strong longshore currents in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Northern Outer Banks and Hatteras Island.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until midnight EDT
tonight. For the Beach Hazards Statement, until 8 PM EDT this
evening.
* IMPACTS...Up to 2 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in a low threat of property damage. Some roads and low
lying property including parking lots, parks, lawns, and homes
adjacent to the waterfront will experience shallow flooding.
Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach
erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from
shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw a
swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom causing neck and
back injuries. Strong longshore currents will create dangerous
swimming conditions.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Swimmers should remain out of the water due to dangerous surf
conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
