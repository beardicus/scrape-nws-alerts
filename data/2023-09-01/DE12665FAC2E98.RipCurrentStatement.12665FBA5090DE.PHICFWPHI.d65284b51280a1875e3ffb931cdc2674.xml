<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents
are forecast. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to one foot
of inundation above ground level is expected in low-lying
areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...Tidal areas in Sussex County, Delaware.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Friday evening.
For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 8:00 PM this evening
until 2:00 AM Friday.
* IMPACTS...At this level, flooding begins on the most
vulnerable roads in coastal and bayside communities, and along
inland tidal waterways. Some partial or full road closures are
possible. Also, rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers
away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Spotty minor tidal flooding may occur in
some areas with Friday evening`s high tide cycle, but overall
waters levels should be noticeably lower.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Stay out of the surf. If you are ever caught in a rip current,
relax and float. Do not swim against the current. If possible,
swim in a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape,
face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
