<headline>Rip Current Statement issued September 01 at 3:34PM EDT until September 02 at 9:00PM EDT by NWS Philadelphia - Mount Holly</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 8 PM THIS EVENING TO
2 AM EDT SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents
are forecast. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to one half
foot of inundation above ground level is expected in low-lying
areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...Tidal areas in the New Jersey counties of Monmouth and
Ocean.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Saturday evening.
For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 8:00 PM this evening until
2:00 AM Saturday.
* IMPACTS...At this level, flooding begins on the most vulnerable
roads in coastal and bayside communities, and along inland
tidal waterways. Some partial or full road closures are
possible. Also remember, rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...An elevated risk of rip currents will
continue through the balance of the holiday weekend. There
should be no additional issues with tidal flooding after
tonight.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of unknown
depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Do not enter the surf. If you are ever caught in a rip current,
relax and float. Do not swim against the current. If possible,
swim in a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape,
face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
