<headline>Special Weather Statement issued August 19 at 4:52PM EDT  by NWS Charleston</headline>
<description>...A strong thunderstorm will impact portions of southeastern
Dickenson and southwestern Buchanan Counties through 515 PM EDT...
At 452 PM EDT, Doppler radar was tracking a strong thunderstorm near
Davenport, moving northeast at 15 mph.
HAZARD...Winds in excess of 30 mph and pea size hail.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.

unsecured objects. Minor damage to outdoor objects is
possible.
Locations impacted include...
Davenport, Trammel, Nora and Vansant.
MAX HAIL SIZE...0.25 IN
MAX WIND GUST...30 MPH</description>
<instruction>If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.
Torrential rainfall is also occurring with this storm and may lead to
localized flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flooded
roadways.
Frequent cloud to ground lightning is occurring with this storm.
Lightning can strike 10 miles away from a thunderstorm. Seek a safe
shelter inside a building or vehicle.
This storm may intensify, so be certain to monitor local radio
stations and available television stations for additional information
and possible warnings from the National Weather Service.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to travel across
flooded roads. Find alternate routes. It takes only a few inches of
swiftly flowing water to carry vehicles away.
Do not drive your vehicle into areas where the water covers the
roadway. The water depth may be too great to allow your car to cross
safely. Move to higher ground.</instruction>
