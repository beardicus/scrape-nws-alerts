<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued August 19 at 8:28PM MST until August 19 at 10:00PM MST by NWS Flagstaff</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Flagstaff has extended the
* Flash Flood Warning for...
Gila County in east central Arizona...
* Until 1000 PM MST.
* As of 825 PM MST, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms had
produced heavy rain. Between 2 and 3.5 inches of rain fell leading
to flash flooding. As a result, the stream gauge along Tonto Creek
near Gun Creek indicates elevated flow. However, the gauge crested
just below 6 feet and is now decreasing. Elevated flow will
continue downstream of this gauge, producing potentially dangerous
conditions.
HAZARD...Life-threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms
producing flash flooding.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Life-threatening flash flooding of low-water
crossings, creeks, normally dry washes and roads.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
mainly rural areas of Gila County and Tonto Creek.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Move to higher ground now. Act quickly to protect your life.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.</instruction>
