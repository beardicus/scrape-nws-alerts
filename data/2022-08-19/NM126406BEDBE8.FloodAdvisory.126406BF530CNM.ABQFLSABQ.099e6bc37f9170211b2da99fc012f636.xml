* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 209 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms from Carrizozo northward toward Claunch. This
will cause arroyo and small stream flooding. Between 0.75 and
1.25 inches of rain have fallen.
- Additional rainfall amounts up to 1 inch are expected over
the area. This additional rain will result in minor flooding.

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Arroyos, streams, and normally dry rivers can become raging killer
currents in a matter of minutes. Water in arroyos can travel many
miles and take hours to reach your location from upstream rain areas.</instruction>
