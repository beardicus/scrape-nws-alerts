<description>...PERIODS OF RAINFALL WILL CONTINUE ACROSS SOUTHCENTRAL THROUGH
AROUND NOONTIME SUNDAY...
Deep and moist southwesterly flow will continue through late
Saturday afternoon/early Saturday evening. As a result, expect
periods of rain to continue. There may be a drier period for much
of Saturday evening through the overnight hours. Then another
round of showers is possible after day break Sunday through
noontime with a drying trend for Sunday afternoon/evening.
Expected additional rainfall amounts through Saturday:
Anchorage Bowl: 0.50&quot; to 0.75&quot;
This additional rain could push small streams and creeks to, or
slightly above, bankfull. Smaller rivers could see water levels
rise to bankfull; however, water levels along larger rivers are
expected to remain below bankfull.
In urban areas, ponding of water and localized flooding on poorly
drained roadways is also possible. Please use caution when
driving or when recreating along or on area waterways.
