<description>...Wintry mix of precipitation including potential freezing rain
through Sunday night...
A low pressure system along the Californian Coast continues to
bring a mixture of snow and rain to Northern and Central Nevada
this early Sunday night. Latest radars is currently seeing showers
mostly over the eastern half Elko County where valleys are slowing
changing over from rain to snow tonight. As we head into the
overnight, chances for pockets of freezing rain become a
possibility in the lower elevations. While not much accumulations
is expected should it occur, hazardous travel could still result
from a small amount of freezing rain on roadways. Make sure to use
caution while driving and be weary of bridges and overpasses as
they are the most susceptible areas to freezing rain.
