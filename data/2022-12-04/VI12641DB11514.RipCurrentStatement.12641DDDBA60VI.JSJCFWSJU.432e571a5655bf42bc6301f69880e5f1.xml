<headline>Rip Current Statement issued December 04 at 1:41PM AST until December 07 at 6:00AM AST by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK NOW IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY MORNING
THROUGH LATE TUESDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Dangerous surf conditions and rip currents expected due
to breaking waves around 6 to 9 feet.
* WHERE...Beaches of St Croix.
* WHEN...From this evening through at least Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Strong currents that can carry even the best
swimmers away from shore and out to sea.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.</instruction>
