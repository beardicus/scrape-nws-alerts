<description>...INTERMITTENT SNOW SHOWERS MAY BRING LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS AND
PERIODS OF SLICK ROADWAYS THROUGH MONDAY...
* Several rounds of moisture are pushing into the Sierra and
adjacent western Nevada through Monday. The first round will
begin to taper off by mid afternoon today. Activity looks to
diminish until Monday morning when another area of moisture
looks move into the area. Overall, snowfall accumulations will
be light (1 inch or less). However, some areas that receive
localized heavier snow showers may accumulate several inches,
particularly across the foothills of the Carson Range, Virginia
City Highlands, and the Surprise Valley.
* With temperatures expected to dip below freezing areawide
tonight, slick and icy roadways are possible by the morning
commute on Monday. Check road conditions before heading out and
allow extra time to get to your destination Monday morning.</description>
