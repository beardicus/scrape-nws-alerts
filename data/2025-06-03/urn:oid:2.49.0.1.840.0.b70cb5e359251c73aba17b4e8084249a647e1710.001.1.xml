        <headline>Air Quality Alert issued June 3 at 3:06PM EDT by NWS Caribou ME</headline>
        <description>The Maine Department of Environmental Protection's Bureau of Air
Quality has issued an Air Quality Alert for ozone from 11 AM
Wednesday to 11 PM EDT Thursday.

Ozone levels are expected to rise into the Unhealthy for Sensitive
Groups range on Wednesday, June 4th and Thursday, June 5th. In
addition, particle pollution levels are expected to be moderate
statewide due to wildfire smoke. It is important to remember that
even in areas with moderate levels of ozone and particle pollution
the health impacts will be compounded by the effects of heat and
humidity.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection recommends that
individuals consider limiting strenuous outdoor physical activity to
reduce the risk of adverse health effects. People who may be
especially sensitive to the effects of elevated levels of pollutants
include the very young, the elderly, those with pre-existing
respiratory problems such as asthma, those with heart disease and
anyone who is working hard outdoors. But if you experience symptoms
such as shortness of breath, coughing, throat irritation or an
uncomfortable sensation in your chest please consider limiting the
intensity and duration of your outdoor activities.

A toll free air quality hotline has been established so Maine
residents can stay informed on the air quality situations. The toll
free number is: 1-800-223-1196.

Additionally the Maine Department of Environmental Protection has
the air quality forecast available on the web at
www.maine.gov/dep/air/aqforecast.
