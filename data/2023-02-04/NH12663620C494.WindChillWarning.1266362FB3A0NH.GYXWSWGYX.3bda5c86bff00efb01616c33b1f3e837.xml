<headline>Wind Chill Warning issued February 04 at 3:13AM EST until February 05 at 1:00AM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...DANGEROUS WIND CHILLS CONTINUE...
.The core of the cold air mass is starting to lift northeast of the
forecast area this morning. Temperatures and wind chills will
gradually improve but are expected to remain dangerous through
sunrise for much of the area and mid afternoon in the mountains.
...WIND CHILL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM EST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Dangerously cold wind chills. Wind chills as low as 45
below zero.
* WHERE...Portions of west central and western Maine. Portions of
northern New Hampshire.
* WHEN...Until 1 AM EST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Frostbite and hypothermia are possible if precautions
are not taken. Exposed skin may become quickly frostbitten or
frozen in as little as 10 minutes. Wind chill values may fall to
extremely dangerous levels.</description>
<instruction>Persons are urged to stay indoors until conditions improve. If you
must go outside, dress in layers. Several layers of clothes will
keep you warmer than a single heavy coat. Cover exposed skin to
reduce your risk of frostbite or hypothermia. Gloves, a scarf, and a
hat will keep you from losing your body heat.
Wrap pipes with insulation and seal windows to avoid loss of heat
from your home. Keep a slow steady stream of water running from
indoor faucets, and open cabinet doors to allow warm air to
circulate around inside pipes.
Keep pets indoors as much as possible.
Make frequent checks on older family, friends, and neighbors. Ensure
portable heaters are used correctly. Do not use generators or grills
inside.</instruction>
