<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued February 04 at 9:16AM HST until February 04 at 11:45AM HST by NWS Honolulu</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Honolulu has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
The island of Oahu in Honolulu County
* Until 1145 AM HST.
* At 916 AM HST, radar indicated heavy rain continuing over Oahu
with rain rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour over saturated ground.
The stream gage at Waiahole Stream indicated a significant rise in
water level, and the level at Waikane Stream was increasing as
well. Rainfall has also been occurring over urban areas on the
south side of the island that will produce flooding impacts on
roads and poor drainage areas.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by heavy rain.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flooding in drainages, streams, rivers, roads,
properties, and other low-lying areas. Public road
closures possible in some areas. Landslides are
possible in steep terrain.
* This warning includes the entire island of Oahu.
This warning may need to be extended beyond 1145 AM HST if flooding
persists.
This Flash Flood Warning replaces the previously issued Flood
Advisory that was in effect for The island of Oahu in Honolulu
County.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>Excessive runoff from heavy rainfall will cause flooding of drainage
ditches and streams, streets, highways, properties, and other low
lying spots.
