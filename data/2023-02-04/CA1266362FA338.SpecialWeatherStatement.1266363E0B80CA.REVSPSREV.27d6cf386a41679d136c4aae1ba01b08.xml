<description>...Winter storm expected to bring impacts to the region through
Sunday evening...
* A winter storm will continue to bring winter weather impacts to
western Nevada, especially in the foothills above 5000 feet.
* Winds: South winds will shift to the southwest on Sunday.
Southwest wind gusts will generally be on the order of 30 to 40
mph, with a few wind prone areas gusting up to 55 mph.
* Precipitation: Snow levels will start out near 5000 feet in
northern Washoe County to 6500 feet in Mineral county. Any
spillover precipitation through early Sunday morning will be
rain for the valleys, with a rain/snow mix possible in the
foothills. A cold front passage by daybreak will rapidly bring
snow levels down to all valley floors through the remainder of
the day.
* Convective snow showers may bring quick bursts of moderate
snowfall rates and impactful roadway accumulation to portions of
western Nevada on Sunday. While overall snowfall amounts are
not expected to be significant across the area, be sure to check
roadway conditions before heading out. You can obtain the
latest information by downloading NDOT`s &quot;NVRoads&quot; application
on your smart phone or by dialing 5 1 1.</description>
