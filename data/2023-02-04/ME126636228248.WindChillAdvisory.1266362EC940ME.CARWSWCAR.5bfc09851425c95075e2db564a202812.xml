<instruction>A Wind Chill Advisory means that cold air and the wind will combine
to create low wind chills. Frostbite and hypothermia can occur if
precautions are not taken. Make sure you wear a hat and gloves.
A Blizzard Warning means severe winter weather conditions are
expected or occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds
and poor visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout
conditions, making travel extremely dangerous. Do not travel. If you
must travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get
stranded, stay with your vehicle.
