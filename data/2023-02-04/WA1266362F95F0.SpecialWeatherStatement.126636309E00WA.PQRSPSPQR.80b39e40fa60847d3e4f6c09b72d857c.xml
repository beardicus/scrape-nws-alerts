<description>...GUSTY WINDS POSSIBLE LATER TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY...
Low pressure strengthening along the coast near the Oregon and
California border will lift north-northeast across western Oregon
through early Sunday morning. This system appears to be developing
stronger than previously expected, and it may now have the
capability of bringing strong wind gusts to inland areas from
roughly Salem southward.
For the Willamette Valley roughly Salem southward, south to
southwesterly wind gusts of 25 to 35 mph are expected. That said,
there is an outside chance that wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph could
occur between roughly 2 AM and 10 AM Sunday morning.
Southwesterly wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph now appear likely for
the Cascades and foothills of northern Oregon and Lane County
late tonight into Sunday, with stronger gusts up to 65 mph
possible for exposed terrain. As snow levels lower to around 3000
feet, these winds would combine with heavy snow, potentially
leading to treacherous conditions today in the Cascades.
Finally, the low pressure will move east of the Cascades,
maintaining strong and gusty winds for the Cascade crest. Westerly
winds will also increase through the central Columbia Gorge and
Hood River valley Sunday afternoon, with gusts up to 50 mph
possible in the central Columbia Gorge and higher portions of the
Hood River Valley.
Uncertainty is unusually high with this developing low and its
impacts, and the forecast is rapidly evolving. Stay tuned for
future updates, advisories, or warnings.</description>
