<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 645 PM PST FOR WEST
CENTRAL NEZ PERCE...CENTRAL GARFIELD...SOUTHEASTERN WHITMAN AND
ASOTIN COUNTIES...
At 613 PM PST, a dangerous snow squall was located over Clarkston
Heights-Vineland, or near Lewiston, moving east at 35 mph.
Visibility was reported down to a quarter mile at Lewiston Airport,
with webcams showing snow-covered roads and near-whiteout conditions.
HAZARD...Flash freeze on roads. Intense bursts of heavy snow. Gusty
winds leading to blowing snow and rapidly falling
visibility. Wind gusts up to 35 mph.
SOURCE...Radar and webcams.
IMPACT...Travel will become difficult and potentially dangerous
within minutes.
This includes the following highways...
U.S. Highway 95 in Idaho between mile markers 309 and 318.
U.S. Highway 12 in Idaho between mile markers 0 and 3.
U.S. Highway 12 in Washington between mile markers 411 and 434.
Locations impacted include...
Lewiston, Clarkston, Clarkston Heights-Vineland, West
Clarkston-Highland, Asotin, Clarkston Heights, Cloverland, Peola,
Alder Thicket Campground, Wickiup Campground, Jerry, and Spruce
Spring Campground.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads,
bridges, and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and
be prepared for a sudden loss of traction.
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.
