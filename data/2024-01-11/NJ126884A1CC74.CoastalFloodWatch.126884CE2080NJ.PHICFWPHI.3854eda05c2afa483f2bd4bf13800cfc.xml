<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY MORNING
THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Up to one foot of inundation above ground level
possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways.
* WHERE...Ocean and Coastal Ocean.
* WHEN...From Saturday morning through Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...At this level, flooding begins on the most
vulnerable roads in coastal and bayside communities, and along
inland tidal waterways. Some partial or full road closures are
possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Strong southerly winds are forecast to
increase again Friday night, which may lead to another round of
moderate coastal flooding impacts along Barnegat Bay late Friday
night into Saturday. The highest impacts will be felt along the
northern locations of Barnegat Bay so moderate flooding may not
be experienced by the Altantic coastal communities however
minor flooding is still forecast.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
