<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 11 at 9:12PM CST until January 13 at 6:00AM CST by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM ARRIVES EARLY FRIDAY AND LINGERS INTO SATURDAY,
THEN DANGEROUSLY COLD AIR FOLLOWS INTO NEXT WEEK...
.Accumulating snow will make its way into southern and eastern
Minnesota early Friday morning. This will be a long duration
event, with relatively low snowfall rates around 0.5 inches/hour
or less. Forecast confidence remains low thus large ranges remain
in the snowfall forecasts. The best chances for 6 or more inches
of snow is generally east of I-35 and south of the Twin Cities
metro.
Northwest winds will increase Friday afternoon in Saturday,
gusting up to 40 mph in portions of southwestern MN. This will
lead to blowing snow and the potential for brief white out
conditions. Confidence is high that dangerously cold wind chills
will follow into Saturday night, with widespread values of -25 to
-40 likely through early next week. A Wind Chill Watch has been
issued for much of western and southern Minnesota.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM FRIDAY TO
6 AM CST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 5 to 8
inches. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of east central and southeast Minnesota and
west central Wisconsin.
* WHEN...From 3 AM Friday to 6 AM CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Patchy blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions
could impact the morning or evening commute.</description>

your vehicle in case of an emergency.
