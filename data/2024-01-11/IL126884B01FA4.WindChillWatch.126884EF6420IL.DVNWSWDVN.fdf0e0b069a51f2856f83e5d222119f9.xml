For the Blizzard Warning, from 5 PM Friday to noon CST

* IMPACTS...Travel will be very difficult to impossible with
significant blowing and drifting snow leading to occasional
whiteout conditions. The hazardous conditions will impact the

For later this weekend into early next week, dangerously cold
wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little

area this evening from south to north. Some areas, south of
Interstate 80 may see a brief period of freezing rain and rain
mixed at times before quickly changing back to snow. Late Friday
afternoon into the evening, much colder air moves in along with
very strong northwest winds which will lead to blizzard
conditions for parts of the area and potentially a flash freeze
on roadways.</description>
