Strong winds could cause tree damage and power outages. Bitter
cold wind chills as low as 25 below zero could cause frostbite
on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The range of potential snow amounts has
increased due to uncertainty regarding the exact track of the

now a 25% chance snow amounts wind up as low as 1 to 2 inches,
and a 25% chance snow amounts wind up around 1 foot or more. Be
