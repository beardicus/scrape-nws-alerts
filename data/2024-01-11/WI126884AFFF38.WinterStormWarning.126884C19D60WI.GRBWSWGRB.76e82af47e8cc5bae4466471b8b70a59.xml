<description>...ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT WINTER STORM TO IMPACT THE REGION WITH HEAVY
SNOW AND STRONG WINDS FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING...
.A strengthening low pressure system will track from the
mid-Mississippi Valley to the central Great Lakes from Friday
morning through midday Saturday. The strong system will bring heavy
snow and strong winds to the region. Most of the region should see 8
to 12 inches of snow, though lower amounts are anticipated in north
central Wisconsin, and higher amounts are expected in far eastern
Wisconsin. In addition, wind gusts could reach 45 mph or higher in
the Fox Valley and lakeshore areas, where near-blizzard conditions
are expected late Friday afternoon and Friday night. Temperatures
near freezing could locally reduce snowfall totals right along the
Lake Michigan shoreline.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM FRIDAY TO NOON
CST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 8 and
12 inches expected. Winds could gust up to 40 mph and create
significant blowing and drifting snow.
* WHERE...Langlade, Florence, Forest, Northern Marinette County,
Northern Oconto County, Southern Marinette County, and Southern
Oconto County Counties.
* WHEN...From 9 AM Friday to noon CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Widespread
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility, and result in
near-blizzard conditions Friday night. The hazardous conditions
will impact the Friday evening commute. Gusty winds could bring
down tree branches, and cause power outages.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road conditions for
the state you are calling from can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
