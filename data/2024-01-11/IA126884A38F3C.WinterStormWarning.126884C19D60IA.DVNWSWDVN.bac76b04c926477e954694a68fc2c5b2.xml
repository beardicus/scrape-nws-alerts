* WHEN...For the Winter Storm Warning, from 9 PM this evening to

dangerously cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed

area this evening from south to north. Some areas, south of
Interstate 80 may see freezing rain and rain mixed at times
Friday morning before quickly changing back to snow. Late Friday
afternoon into the evening, much colder air moves in along with
very strong northwest winds which will lead to significant
blowing and drifting snow, and the potential for roadways to
become icy.</description>
