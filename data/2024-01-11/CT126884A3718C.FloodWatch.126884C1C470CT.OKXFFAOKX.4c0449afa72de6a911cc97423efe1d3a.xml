<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY EVENING THROUGH SATURDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of southern Connecticut, including the following
areas, Northern Fairfield, Northern Middlesex, Northern New Haven,
Northern New London, Southern Fairfield, Southern Middlesex,
Southern New Haven and Southern New London, northeast New Jersey,
including the following areas, Eastern Bergen, Eastern Essex,
Eastern Passaic, Eastern Union, Hudson, Western Bergen, Western
Essex, Western Passaic and Western Union, and southeast New York,
including the following areas, Northern Westchester, Rockland and
Southern Westchester.
* WHEN...From Friday evening through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Another deepening low will track up through the Great Lakes
Saturday night, sending a strong frontal system through the
area. Moderate to occasionally heavy rainfall will fall
across the area with a widespread 1 to 2 inches of rainfall
with locally higher amounts possible. Due to the recent heavy
rainfall event, streamflow is high and grounds are saturated.
Quick responding rivers and streams will likely reach or
exceed bankfull. In addition, coastal flooding will likely
exacerbate flooding on tidal rivers.
