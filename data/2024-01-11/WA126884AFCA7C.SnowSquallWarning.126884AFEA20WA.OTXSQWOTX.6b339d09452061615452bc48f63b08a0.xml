Northwestern Nez Perce County in north central Idaho...
Northeastern Garfield County in southeastern Washington...
Southeastern Whitman County in eastern Washington...
North central Asotin County in southeastern Washington...

* At 519 PM PST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from 9 miles north of Pomeroy to near Lapwai, moving east
at 20 mph.
HAZARD...Flash freeze on roads. Intense bursts of heavy snow.
Gusty winds leading to blowing snow and rapidly falling
visibility. Wind gusts up to 35 mph.
SOURCE...Radar and webcams.
IMPACT...Dangerous and life-threatening travel conditions are
expected to develop rapidly in the warning area.
This includes the following highways...
U.S. Highway 95 in Idaho between mile markers 296 and 329.
U.S. Highway 12 in Idaho between mile markers 0 and 24.
U.S. Highway 12 in Washington between mile markers 430 and 434.

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads,
bridges, and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and
be prepared for a sudden loss of traction.
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.
