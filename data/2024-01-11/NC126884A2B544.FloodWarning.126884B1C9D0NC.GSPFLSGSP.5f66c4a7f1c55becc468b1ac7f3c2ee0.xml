<headline>Flood Warning issued January 11 at 10:45AM EST until January 12 at 9:28AM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in North
Carolina...
French Broad River At Blantyre affecting Henderson and
Transylvania Counties.
...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in North
Carolina...
French Broad River Near Fletcher affecting Henderson and Buncombe
Counties.
.A potent storm system produced 5-7 inches of rainfall across the
upper French Broad River watershed from early Tuesday morning
through Tuesday afternoon.  This rainfall quickly overwhelmed
saturated soils and resulted in excessive runoff and significant
stream rises across Transylvania and Henderson counties, with
widespread Minor to Moderate flooding.  This excessive flow caused
the upper French Broad River from Rosman downstream to Brevard,
Blantyre, Etowah, and Fletcher to exceed Moderate Flood Stage.
Inundation effects within the river valley will continue to recede.
Tributaries feeding the French Broad River have crested and fallen
back below bankfull levels and the mainstem French Broad River
floodwave has passed Rosman.  Therefore, the French Broad River
downstream at Blantyre is expected to crest overnight tonight.
Significant and damaging flows along Mud Creek have caused the
French Broad River near Fletcher to rise consistently through the
evening hours on Tuesday.  However, Mud Creek has crested and the
floodwave is approaching the French Broad River confluence near
Fletcher.  Therefore, the French Broad River will crest near
Fletcher overnight tonight and is not expected to approach the
Moderate Flood Stage of 17.00 feet.
...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL LATE TOMORROW MORNING...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is occurring and minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...French Broad River at Blantyre.
* WHEN...Until late tomorrow morning.
* IMPACTS...At 19.0 feet, Moderate Flood Stage.  The French Broad
River may be overtopping the railroad tracks and floodwaters may
be threatening a trailer park on River Ridge Rd. Floodwaters may
be approaching buildings north of Grove Bridge Road along US 64.
Parts of River Road, Pleasant Grove Rd., Butler Bridge Rd. and Big
Willow Rd. are likely flooding. Associated tributaries, including
Little River, are likely flooding due to high water levels on the
French Broad River.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 10:30 AM EST Thursday the stage was 18.6 feet.
- Bankfull stage is 15.0 feet.
- Recent Activity...The maximum river stage in the 24 hours
ending at 10:30 AM EST Thursday was 20.3 feet.
