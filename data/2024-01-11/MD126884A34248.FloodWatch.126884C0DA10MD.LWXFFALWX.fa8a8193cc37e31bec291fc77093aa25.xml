- A period of moderate to locally heavy rain is expected ahead

Rainfall amounts around three quarters of an inch to an inch
and a half are most likely with localized amounts around 2
inches possible. Most of the rain will fall in a three to six
hour period Friday evening. The locally heavy rain combined
with already saturated soil may cause excess runoff leading

flooding in urban and low-lying areas.
