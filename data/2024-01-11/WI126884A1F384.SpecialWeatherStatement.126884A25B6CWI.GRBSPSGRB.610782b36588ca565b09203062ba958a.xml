<description>...LIGHT TO MODERATE SNOW EXPECTED for THE MORNING COMMUTE TO
WORK OR SCHOOL...
Light snow continued across northeast Wisconsin early this
morning, including all of Door County. The latest radar images
indicated a circulation over Lake Michigan moved onshore eastern
Door County, between Whitefish Bay and Baileys Harbor. Snowfall
rates with this feature may be as high as 1 to 2 inches per hour
resulting in locally higher snowfall amounts. The light snow
should come to an end by late morning. Any untreated surfaces
will be snow covered and slippery. If you encounter untreated
roads or bridges, slow down and allow extra distance between you
and the car in front of you. Allow a little extra time for your
morning commute to work or school.</description>
