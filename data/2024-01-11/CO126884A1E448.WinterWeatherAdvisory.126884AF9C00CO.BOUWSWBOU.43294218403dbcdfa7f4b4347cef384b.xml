<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 11 at 3:10AM MST until January 11 at 5:00PM MST by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>...MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF MOUNTAIN SNOW, ALONG WITH ARCTIC COLD...
.Several rounds of snow and blowing snow will occur in the mountains
over the next several days, some of which will be heavy.
The first round of snow this morning will taper off by afternoon.
Then, another round will develop in the mountains tonight and
increase through Friday and Friday night. That will combine with
strong winds gusts of 50 to 70 mph above timberline to produce
widespread blowing and drifting snow, poor visibility, and dangerous
travel conditions.
While the snow may taper off later Saturday, another round of
heavier snow is likely to develop Saturday night and continue
through Sunday.
On the plains, arctic cold will settle across the area Friday night
into Saturday, with dangerously cold wind chill readings expected to
last all the way through Tuesday morning. This will be an extended
cold snap, resulting in a heightened risk of frostbite and
hypothermia for people with prolonged outdoor exposure, and an
increased burden on outdoor animals.
Periods of light snow in lower elevations starting Friday night will
lead to slick roads at times through this weekend.

AFTERNOON...
...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE THIS EVENING THROUGH
