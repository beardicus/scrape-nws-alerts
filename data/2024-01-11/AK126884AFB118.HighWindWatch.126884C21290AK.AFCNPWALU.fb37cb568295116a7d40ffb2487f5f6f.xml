MORNING...
* WHAT...Northwest winds 40 to 50 mph with gusts up to 75 mph
possible.
* WHERE...Eastern Aleutians.
* WHEN...From Friday evening through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...High winds could move loose debris, damage property,

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A deepening North Pacific low is forecast
to lift across the Eastern Aleutians Friday night into Saturday.
North to northwesterly winds on the backside of the low have the

west to east Friday night, with Nikolski to experience the
strongest winds initially. Gusty conditions will then taper off
in a similar fashion from west to east later on Saturday morning
with Akutan to experience the tail-end of enhanced winds.</description>

on this situation. Fasten loose objects or shelter objects in a
safe location prior to the onset of winds.</instruction>
