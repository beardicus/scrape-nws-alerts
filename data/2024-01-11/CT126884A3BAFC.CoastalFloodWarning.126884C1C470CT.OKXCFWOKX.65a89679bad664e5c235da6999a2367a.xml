<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued January 11 at 5:15PM EST until January 13 at 2:00PM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 7 AM TO 2 PM EST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...2 to 2 1/2 ft of inundation above ground level expected
in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...Southern Middlesex and Southern New London Counties.
* WHEN...From 7 AM to 2 PM EST Saturday.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Potential for widespread moderate
flooding of vulnerable areas near the waterfront and
shoreline, Saturday morning. Potential for 2 to 2 1/2 ft of
inundation above ground level in low lying, vulnerable areas.
This would result in numerous road closures and cause
widespread flooding of low lying property including parking
lots, parks, lawns and homes/businesses with basements near
the waterfront. Vehicles parked in vulnerable areas near the
waterfront would likely become flooded. Flooding would also
extend inland from the waterfront along tidal rivers and bays.
Runoff from heavy rainfall could exacerbate flooding issues
along tidal rivers.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...Potential for breaking waves of 3 to 5 ft
during the Saturday morning high tide. This would result in
beach erosion and some damage to shoreline structures, as well
as wave splashover onto shoreline roads and properties.
* RIVERINE IMPACTS...Freshwater runoff coinciding with the
Saturday morning high tide could exacerbate street and property
flooding issues along tidal reaches of rivers in southeastern
CT.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The timing of a wind shift from
southeasterly to southwesterly gales in relation to the time of
high tide Saturday morning will be key to the water level
forecast. This will be refined over the next 24 to 36 hours.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
