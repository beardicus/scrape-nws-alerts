.A northwest (320 degrees) and north (350 degree) swell will
arrive and pass through the region through Saturday, with both
swells peaking at high end advisory levels for smaller islands on
Friday. Additional wave run-up is possible during the early
morning high tides over the next couple of days due to higher than
predicted tides. This will likely produce minor to localized
moderate coastal flooding both Friday and Saturday mornings.

...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE FRIDAY
NIGHT...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, surf peaking at 18 to 24

shores. For the Coastal Flood Statement, minor to localized
moderate low lying coastal flooding during times of high tide.
* WHERE...For the High Surf Advisory, north and west facing shores
of Niihau, Kauai, Oahu and Molokai, and for the north facing
shores of Maui. For the Coastal Flood Statement, any low lying
flood prone coastal location.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 6 AM HST Saturday.
For the Coastal Flood Statement, through late Friday night.

<instruction>Avoid driving through flooded roadways. If you are forced to
drive through salt water, be sure to rinse your vehicle with
fresh water. Move electronics, vehicles or other valuables to
higher ground. Monitor vessels to ensure mooring lines don`t get
too tight and watch out for overwash around boat ramps. Secure
canoes or other watercraft stowed on beaches.
Head all advice from ocean safety officials. When in doubt, don`t
go out.</instruction>
