<headline>Flood Warning issued January 11 at 10:52AM EST until January 12 at 9:15AM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in North
Carolina...
South Fork Catawba River At Lowell affecting Gaston County.
.A potent storm system produced 2.5-4.5 inches of rainfall across
the South Fork Catawba watershed from Tuesday morning through
Tuesday evening.  This rainfall quickly overwhelmed saturated soils
and resulted in excessive runoff and significant stream rises across
southeastern Burke County, Catawba County, Lincoln County, and
Gaston County, with several small tributaries of the SF Catawba
River exceeding bankfull and causing Minor to Moderate flooding of
adjacent areas. Inundation effects will continue to recede over the
next 24 hours.
Tributaries feeding the SF Catawba River have been stubbornly rising
through the early nighttime hours in response to impressive soil
saturation and runoff.  This has prolonged the rise downstream along
the SF Catawba River from Lowell to Cramerton, resulting in an
increase in the expected crest from 13.6 feet to near 14.2 feet.
However, most tributaries are finally cresting and receding.
Therefore, the floodwave is approaching the lower reaches of the SF
Catawba River and a crest is imminent, expected between midnight and
2am tonight.
...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL LATE TOMORROW MORNING...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is occurring and minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...South Fork Catawba River at Lowell.
* WHEN...Until late tomorrow morning.
* IMPACTS...At 13.0 feet, Moderate Flood Stage.  The South Fork
Catawba River may begin inundating the lowest floors and/or crawl
spaces of homes along Riverside Dr. between 4th St. and 5th St. in
Cramerton.  Impacts may be similar to those associated with
flooding on October 9th, 2005.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 10:15 AM EST Thursday the stage was 12.7 feet.
- Bankfull stage is 9.0 feet.
- Recent Activity...The maximum river stage in the 24 hours
ending at 10:15 AM EST Thursday was 15.1 feet.

late this evening and continue falling to 3.9 feet Tuesday
morning.
