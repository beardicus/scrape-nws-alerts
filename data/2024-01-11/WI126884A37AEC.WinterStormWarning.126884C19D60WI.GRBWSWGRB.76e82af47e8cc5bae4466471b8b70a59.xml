<description>...ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT WINTER STORM TO IMPACT THE REGION WITH HEAVY
SNOW AND STRONG WINDS FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING...
.A strengthening low pressure system will track from the
mid-Mississippi Valley to the central Great Lakes from Friday
morning through midday Saturday. The strong system will bring heavy
snow and strong winds to the region. Probability of at least 6
inches of snow range from 60 to 90% across all of north-central and
northeast Wisconsin. In addition, wind gusts could reach 45 mph or
higher in the Fox Valley and lakeshore areas, where near-blizzard
conditions are possible, particularly on Friday night. Temperatures
near to slightly above freezing could locally reduce snowfall totals
right along the Lake Michigan shoreline.
...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM FRIDAY TO NOON CST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 8 and
12 inches possible. Winds could gust up to 40 mph and create
significant blowing and drifting snow.
* WHERE...Langlade, Florence, Forest, Northern Marinette County,
Northern Oconto County, Southern Marinette County, and Southern
Oconto County Counties.
* WHEN...From 9 AM Friday to noon CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Widespread
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility, and result in
near-blizzard conditions at times. The hazardous conditions could
impact the Friday evening commute. Gusty winds could bring down
tree branches, and cause power outages.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road conditions for
the state you are calling from can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
