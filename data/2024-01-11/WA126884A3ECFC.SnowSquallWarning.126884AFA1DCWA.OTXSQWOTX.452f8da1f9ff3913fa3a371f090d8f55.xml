<description>The National Weather Service in Spokane has issued a
* Snow Squall Warning for...
Southwestern Grant County in north central Washington...
* Until 415 PM PST.
* At 342 PM PST, a dangerous snow squall was located along
Interstate 90 between Vantage and George.
HAZARD...Flash freeze on roads. Intense bursts of heavy snow.
Gusty winds leading to blowing snow and visibility
less than one-quarter mile. Wind gusts up to 30 mph.
SOURCE...Radar and webcams.
IMPACT...Dangerous and life-threatening travel conditions are
expected in the warning area.
This includes Interstate 90 in Washington between mile markers 138
and 149.

George.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads,
bridges, and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and
be prepared for a sudden loss of traction.
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.
