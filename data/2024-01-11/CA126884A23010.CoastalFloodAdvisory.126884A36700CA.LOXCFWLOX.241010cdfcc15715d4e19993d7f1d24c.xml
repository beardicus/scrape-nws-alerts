<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON PST
TODAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM PST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 12
to 17 feet today, will subside slowly tonight, then drop below
10 feet Friday morning. There will be dangerous rip currents.
For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding
expected at the time of the high tides this morning.
* WHERE...San Luis Obispo County Beaches and Santa Barbara
County Central Coast Beaches.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until noon PST today.
For the High Surf Advisory, until 9 AM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely, around the time of
high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as
parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to
roads or structures is NOT expected. There is an increased
risk for ocean drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers and
surfers out to sea. Large breaking waves can cause injury,
wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats
near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...High tide this morning is predicted to be
around 7 feet at 855 AM.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
