<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued January 11 at 5:15PM EST until January 13 at 2:00PM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 7 AM TO 2 PM EST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...2 to 2 1/2, locally 3 feet of inundation above ground level
expected in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...Southern Queens County.
* WHEN...From 7 AM to 2 PM EST Saturday.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Widespread moderate to locally major
flooding of vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline
Saturday morning, with 2 to 2 1/2 ft, locally 3 ft of inundation
above ground level in low lying, vulnerable areas. This will
result in numerous road closures and cause widespread flooding
of low lying property including parking lots, parks, lawns and
homes/businesses with basements near the waterfront. Vehicles
parked in vulnerable areas near the waterfront will likely
become flooded and destroyed. Flooding will also extend inland
from the waterfront along tidal rivers and bays.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...Breaking waves of 8 to 12 feet along the
oceanfront may result in scattered dune erosion and localized
overwashes. Localized flooding of roadways and vulnerable
structures behind protective dunes is possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The timing of a wind shift from
southeasterly to southwesterly gales in relation to the time of
high tide Saturday morning will be key to the water level
forecast. Peak surge of 3 to 4 ft will be likely between times
of high tide Friday evening and Saturday morning. Tidal piling
may inhibit the recession of water before the Saturday AM high
tide, which would cause major flooding (around 3 ft of
inundation above ground). Residents in coastal communities in
this area should prepare for the potential of major coastal
flooding (3ft of inundation above ground). This will be refined
over the next 24 to 36 hours.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
