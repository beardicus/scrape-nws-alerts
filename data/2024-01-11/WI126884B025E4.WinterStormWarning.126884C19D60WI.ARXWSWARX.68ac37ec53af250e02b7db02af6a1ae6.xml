<description>...Winter Storm Brings Snow, Wind To The Region Friday Into
Saturday Morning...
.A potent winter storm promises heavy snow and strong winds from
Friday into Saturday morning. The bulk of the snow will fall
Friday with accumulations upwards of a foot expected for some.
Snowfall rates 1/2 to 1 inch per hour will be common Friday. Winds
ramp up Friday afternoon, gusting from 30 to 40 mph into early
Saturday morning. Blowing and drifting snows will result, and
localized white-out conditions could be realized...especially
across the open, unsheltered areas of southeast Minnesota and
northeast Iowa.
Travel will become hazardous for most of the region, potentially
impossible where snowfall and winds are the highest. Consider
altering, delaying or even canceling travel plans if conditions
warrant it.
Bitterly cold air arrives as this storm system exits the area with
wind chills of 20 to 30 below by Saturday night.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow with accumulations of 5 to 8 inches. Winds
gusting as high as 40 mph producing patchy blowing and drifting
the snow.
* WHERE...Taylor and Clark Counties.
* WHEN...Until noon CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Patchy blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions
will impact the evening commute.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
