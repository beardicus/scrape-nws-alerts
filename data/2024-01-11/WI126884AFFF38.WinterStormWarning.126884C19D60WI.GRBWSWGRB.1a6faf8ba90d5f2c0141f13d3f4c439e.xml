<description>...ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT WINTER STORM TO IMPACT THE REGION WITH HEAVY
SNOW AND STRONG WINDS FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING...
.A strengthening low pressure system will track from the
mid-Mississippi Valley to the central Great Lakes from Friday

to 12 inches of snow, though lower amounts are anticipated in north
central Wisconsin, and higher amounts are expected in far eastern
Wisconsin. In addition, wind gusts could reach 45 mph or higher in
the Fox Valley and lakeshore areas, where near-blizzard conditions
are expected late Friday afternoon and Friday night. Temperatures
near freezing could locally reduce snowfall totals right along the
Lake Michigan shoreline.

CST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 5 and
8 inches. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph and create blowing and
drifting snow.
* WHERE...Lincoln, Oneida, and Vilas Counties.
* WHEN...From 9 AM Friday to noon CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Areas of blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions
will impact the Friday evening commute.</description>
