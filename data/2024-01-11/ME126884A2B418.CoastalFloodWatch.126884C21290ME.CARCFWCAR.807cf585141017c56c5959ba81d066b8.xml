<headline>Coastal Flood Watch issued January 11 at 10:42AM EST until January 13 at 4:00PM EST by NWS Caribou</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY MORNING
THROUGH SATURDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Minor to moderate coastal flooding possible. Two to
three feet of inundation above ground level possible in low-
lying areas near shorelines.
* WHERE...Coastal Hancock and Coastal Washington Counties.
* WHEN...Saturday midday high tide near 1145 AM.
* IMPACTS...Inundation could affect locations such as Deer Isle
Causeway, Oak Point Causeway on Deer Isle, Machias,
Stonington, Winter Harbor, Bangor, Brewer, Milbridge, Swans
Island, South Lubec and Eastport. Large breaking waves will
cause overtopping of exposed coastal roadways, allowing large
rocks to cause damage to vehicles. Areas of concern include
but not limited to, Schoodic Point and Seawall Road. Road
debris and minor road damage could close some roadways.
Significant beach erosion from the previous storm will make
erosion prone areas more susceptible to increased erosion.
Beach erosion is expected at locations such as Rogue Bluffs.
Erosion and damage to dune structures is expected.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
