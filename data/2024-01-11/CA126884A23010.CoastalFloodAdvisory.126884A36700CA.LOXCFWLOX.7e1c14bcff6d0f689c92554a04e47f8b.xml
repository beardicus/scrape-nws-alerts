<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued January 11 at 4:04AM PST until January 11 at 12:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST THIS
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON PST
TODAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, 5 to 8 feet with sets to 9
feet will subside to 4 to 6 feet by late evening. Dangerous
rip currents are likely. Surf highest on west-facing beaches.
For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding is
expected this morning.
* WHERE...Catalina and Santa Barbara Islands, Malibu Coast and
Los Angeles County Beaches.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 10 PM PST this
evening. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until noon PST today.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely, around the time of
high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as
parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to
roads or structures is NOT expected. There is an increased
risk for ocean drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers and
surfers out to sea. Large breaking waves can cause injury,
wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats
near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The high tide this morning is predicted
to be near 7.3 feet at around 820 AM.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
