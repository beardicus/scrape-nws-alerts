<description>The National Weather Service in Spokane has issued a
* Snow Squall Warning for...
Northern Garfield County in southeastern Washington...
Southeastern Whitman County in eastern Washington...
Northwestern Asotin County in southeastern Washington...
* Until 530 PM PST.
* At 442 PM PST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from near Delaney to 12 miles southeast of Pomeroy,
moving east at 25 mph.
HAZARD...Flash freeze on roads. Intense bursts of heavy snow.
Gusty winds leading to blowing snow and rapidly falling
visibility. Wind gusts up to 35 mph.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Travel will become difficult and potentially dangerous
within minutes.
This includes U.S. Highway 12 in Washington between mile markers 390
and 429.

Pomeroy and Dodge.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads,
bridges, and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and
be prepared for a sudden loss of traction.
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.
