<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 11 at 3:16PM PST until January 14 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM PST SUNDAY
ABOVE 1500 FEET...
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH LATE SATURDAY NIGHT FOR ELEVATIONS BELOW 1500 FEET...
* WHAT...For the Winter Storm Warning above 1500 feet, heavy snow
expected. Additional snow accumulations of 1 to 2 feet, highest
above 2000 feet. Winds could gust as high as 50 mph. For the
Winter Storm Watch below 1500 feet, heavy snow and freezing rain
possible. Total snow accumulations of 2 to 10 inches and ice
accumulations up to 0.3 inches possible. Winds could gust as
high as 55 mph.
* WHERE...In Oregon, Northern Oregon Cascade Foothills and
Cascade Foothills in Lane County. In Washington, South
Washington Cascade Foothills.
* WHEN...From Friday afternoon through late Saturday night.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult above 1500 feet. Gusty
winds could cause white-out conditions at times near the
Columbia River Gorge. Ice accumulation and gusty winds could
bring down tree branches, leading to power outages. Bitter cold
wind chills as low as 25 below zero could cause frostbite on
exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...For elevations below 1500 feet, snow will
likely begin Friday evening but will likely not accumulate on
surfaces until later Friday night. Mainly snow is expected for
the north Oregon Cascade foothills, while mainly freezing rain
or rain is expected for the Lane County Cascade foothills.
However, uncertainty remains high regarding exact snow and ice
amounts, as well as exact temperatures in the Lane County
Cascade foothills where there is a chance temperatures stay
above freezing with minimal impacts.</description>
