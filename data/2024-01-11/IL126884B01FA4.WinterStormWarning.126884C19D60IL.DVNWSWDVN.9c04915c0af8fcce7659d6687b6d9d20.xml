<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST SATURDAY...
...WIND CHILL WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY EVENING
THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected with a period of mixed precipitation
along and south of a line from Sterling, Illinois to Fairfield,
Iowa. Total snow accumulations of 7 to 14 inches, highest north
of Highway 30, and ice accumulations of a light glaze. Northeast
winds gusting up to 40 mph, turning to the northwest Friday
afternoon. For the Wind Chill Watch, dangerously cold wind
chills possible. Wind chills as low as 40 below zero.
* WHERE...Portions of north central and northwest Illinois and
east central and northeast Iowa.
* WHEN...For the Winter Storm Warning, until noon CST Saturday.
For the Wind Chill Watch, from Saturday evening through
Tuesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be very difficult and dangerous.
Significant blowing and drifting snow will drop visibilities to
a quarter mile or less at times. The hazardous conditions will
impact the Friday morning and evening commutes. Gusty winds
could bring down tree branches, which could lead to isolated
power outages. For later this weekend into early next week,
dangerously cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed
skin in as little as 10 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Moderate to heavy snow will overspread the
area tonight from south to north. Some areas, south of
Interstate 80 may see a brief period of freezing rain and rain
mixed at times Friday morning before quickly changing back to
snow. Late Friday afternoon into the evening, much colder air
moves in along with very strong northwest winds which will lead
to significant blowing and drifting snow, and the potential for
roadways to become icy</description>
