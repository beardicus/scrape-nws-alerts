<headline>Wind Chill Advisory issued January 11 at 2:11PM CST until January 12 at 12:00PM CST by NWS Hastings</headline>
<description>...MORE SNOW ON THE WAY, FOLLOWED BY SEVERAL DAYS OF BITTER COLD...
...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST FRIDAY...
...WIND CHILL ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT TONIGHT TO
NOON CST FRIDAY...
...WIND CHILL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM FRIDAY TO NOON CST
TUESDAY...
* WHAT...For the Winter Storm Warning, heavy snow expected, along
with blowing snow. Total snow accumulations between 2 and 5
inches, with the highest amounts expected to be near and north of
Interstate 80. This snow will be accompanied by north winds
gusting to around 35 MPH. For the Wind Chill Advisory tonight into
Friday morning, wind chills around -20 to -25 are expected. For
the Wind Chill Warning Friday evening through Tuesday morning,
dangerously cold wind chills of at least -25 to -40 are expected.
* WHERE...Greeley, Howard, Adams, Hall, and Webster Counties.
* WHEN...For the Winter Storm Warning, until noon CST Friday. For
the Wind Chill Advisory, from midnight tonight to noon CST Friday.
For the Wind Chill Warning, from 6 PM Friday to noon CST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Widespread snow and
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility and impact the
Friday morning commute. The dangerously cold wind chills could
cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...For the Winter Storm Warning, please note
that some areas will see the onset of snow before others, and the
majority of snow will actually occur this evening into tonight,
then gradually end from west to east late tonight into Friday
morning. Within any heavier snow bands, near-blizzard conditions
with visibility reduced to around one-half mile are quite possible
at times given the moderately-strong winds blowing around the
relatively dry snow.</description>
