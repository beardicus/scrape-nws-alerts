<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 530 PM PST FOR
NORTHERN GARFIELD...SOUTHEASTERN WHITMAN AND NORTHWESTERN ASOTIN
COUNTIES...
At 510 PM PST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from 11 miles northwest of Pomeroy to 7 miles northwest of
Clarkston Heights-Vineland, moving east at 25 mph. Travel on U.S.
Highway 12 between Pomeroy and Clarkston is strongly discouraged.
HAZARD...Flash freeze on roads. Intense bursts of heavy snow. Gusty
winds leading to blowing snow and visibility rapidly
falling to less than one-quarter mile. Wind gusts greater
than 35 mph.
SOURCE...Radar and webcams.
IMPACT...Travel will become difficult and potentially dangerous
within minutes.
This includes U.S. Highway 12 in Washington between mile markers 390
and 429.
Locations impacted include...
Pomeroy and Dodge.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads,
bridges, and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and
be prepared for a sudden loss of traction.
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.
