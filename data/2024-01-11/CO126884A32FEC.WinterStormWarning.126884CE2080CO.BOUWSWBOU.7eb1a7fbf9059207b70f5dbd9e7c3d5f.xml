MST SATURDAY...
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IS CANCELLED...

in the 50 to 70 mph range over the higher elevations and east

Mosquito Range, and the Indian Peaks.
* WHEN...Heavy snow will develop late tonight in the Park Range and

<instruction>Consider delaying travel over the mountains, or traveling today or
early Friday before the worst conditions. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution. Consider taking a winter

booster cables, flashlight, shovel, blankets and extra clothing.
Also take water, a first aid kit, and anything else that would help
you survive in case you become stranded. The latest road conditions
