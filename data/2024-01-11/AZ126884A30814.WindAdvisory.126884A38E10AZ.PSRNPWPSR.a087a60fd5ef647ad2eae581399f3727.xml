<headline>Wind Advisory issued January 11 at 10:57AM MST until January 11 at 2:00PM MST by NWS Phoenix</headline>
<description>...WIND ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 PM MST THIS
AFTERNOON...
...HARD FREEZE WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM TO 9 AM MST
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Wind Advisory, northwest winds 15 to 25 mph with
gusts up to 45 mph. For the Hard Freeze Warning, temperatures as
low as the mid to upper 20s.
* WHERE...Parker Valley and Central La Paz County.
* WHEN...For the Wind Advisory, from 9 AM this morning to 2 PM
MST this afternoon. For the Hard Freeze Warning, from 1 AM to
9 AM MST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Difficult driving conditions, especially for larger
vehicles traveling along roads with crosswinds. Light,
unsecured objects may become airborne. Frost and freeze
conditions will kill crops, other sensitive vegetation and
possibly damage unprotected outdoor plumbing.</description>
<instruction>A Wind Advisory means that sustained wind speeds of between
30 and 40 mph are expected, or wind gusts of between 40 and
58 mph. Winds this strong can make driving difficult, especially
for high profile vehicles. In addition, strong winds over desert
areas could result in briefly lowered visibilities to well under
a mile at times in blowing dust or blowing sand. Use extra
caution.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
