<headline>Flood Warning issued January 11 at 10:45AM EST until January 12 at 7:55AM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in North
Carolina...
French Broad River At Blantyre affecting Henderson and
Transylvania Counties.
...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in North
Carolina...
French Broad River Near Fletcher affecting Henderson and Buncombe
Counties.
.A potent storm system produced 5-7 inches of rainfall across the
upper French Broad River watershed from early Tuesday morning
through Tuesday afternoon.  This rainfall quickly overwhelmed
saturated soils and resulted in excessive runoff and significant
stream rises across Transylvania and Henderson counties, with
widespread Minor to Moderate flooding.  This excessive flow caused
the upper French Broad River from Rosman downstream to Brevard,
Blantyre, Etowah, and Fletcher to exceed Moderate Flood Stage.
Inundation effects within the river valley will continue to recede.
Tributaries feeding the French Broad River have crested and fallen
back below bankfull levels and the mainstem French Broad River
floodwave has passed Rosman.  Therefore, the French Broad River
downstream at Blantyre is expected to crest overnight tonight.
Significant and damaging flows along Mud Creek have caused the
French Broad River near Fletcher to rise consistently through the
evening hours on Tuesday.  However, Mud Creek has crested and the
floodwave is approaching the French Broad River confluence near
Fletcher.  Therefore, the French Broad River will crest near
Fletcher overnight tonight and is not expected to approach the
Moderate Flood Stage of 17.00 feet.

* WHAT...Minor flooding is occurring and minor flooding is forecast.

to Avery Creek are experiencing scattered flooding.  Glenn Bridge
Park and river access is experiencing scattered flooding.
