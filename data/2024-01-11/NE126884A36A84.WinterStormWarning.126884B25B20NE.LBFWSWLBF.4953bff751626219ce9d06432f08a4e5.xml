emergency. If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and

strong winds will create dangerously low wind chill values. This
will result in frostbite and lead to hypothermia or death if
precautions are not taken.
A Wind Chill Advisory means that very cold air and strong winds
will combine to generate low wind chills. This will result in
frostbite and lead to hypothermia if precautions are not taken.
