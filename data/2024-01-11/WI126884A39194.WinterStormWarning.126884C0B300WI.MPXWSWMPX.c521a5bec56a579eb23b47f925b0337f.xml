<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 11 at 3:09PM CST until January 13 at 6:00AM CST by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM ARRIVES EARLY FRIDAY AND LINGERS INTO SATURDAY,
THEN DANGEROUSLY COLD AIR FOLLOWS INTO NEXT WEEK...
.Accumulating snow will make its way into southern and eastern
Minnesota around midnight tonight and will gradually make its way
north into central Minnesota and western Wisconsin overnight.
This will be a long duration event, with relatively low snowfall
rates around 0.5 inches/hour or less. There is higher confidence
in 6+ inches of snow in areas south of the line from Redwood Falls
to the southern TC metro and over through Chippewa county in
Wisconsin. A Winter Storm Warning is in effect for those areas. Snow
amounts across the rest of central Minnesota will range from 3-6
inches where a Winter Weather Advisory is in effect. As the
forecast confidence increases, the advisory may need to be
upgraded for portions of central Minnesota and western WI.
Northwest winds will increase Friday afternoon in Saturday,
gusting up to 40 mph in portions of southwestern MN. This will
lead to blowing snow and the potential for brief white out
conditions. Confidence is high that dangerously cold wind chills
will follow into Saturday night, with widespread values of -25 to -40
likely through early next week. A Wind Chill Watch has been
issued for much of western and southern Minnesota.
...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM FRIDAY TO 6 AM CST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 5 to 8
inches. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...Pierce, Dunn, Pepin, Chippewa and Eau Claire Counties.
* WHEN...From 3 AM Friday to 6 AM CST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Patchy blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions
could impact the morning or evening commute.</description>
