<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM EDT SATURDAY
THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING NORTH OF CAPE HATTERAS...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT HAS EXPIRED...
* WHAT...Dangerous rip currents, large breaking waves expected,
and strong longshore currents in the surf zone.
* WHERE...The beaches north of Cape Hatteras.
* WHEN...From 8 AM EDT Saturday through Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw
a swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom causing neck
and back injuries. Strong longshore currents will create
dangerous swimming conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most likely time for strong rip
currents to occur is a couple hours either side of low tide,
which will occur around 5:09PM Saturday.</description>
<instruction>Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
