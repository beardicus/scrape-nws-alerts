<description>...EARLY SEASON WINTER STORM WILL BRING GUSTY WINDS, SNOWFALL,
AND MUCH COLDER TEMPERATURES NEXT WEEK...
* STRONG AND GUSTY WINDS: Winds will increase on Tuesday out
ahead of an approaching cold front. Gusts of 35-45 mph are
likely in the valleys with gusts possibly exceeding 55 mph in
wind prone locations. Sierra ridgetop gusts could reach 80-100
mph. Impacts from winds include road travel restrictions due to
cross winds especially for high profile vehicles, aviation
turbulence/shear, hazardous boating conditions, and patchy
blowing dust downwind of dry lake beds - especially before the
arrival of precipitation. Wind impacts will likely diminish
through the day Wednesday.
* SNOWFALL IMPACTS: The first significant and impactful snowfall
of the season looks to occur with this system. Early in the day
Tuesday, precipitation will likely start out as snow above 6,000
feet as the main band pushes into northeastern California and
the Sierra. Rain or a rain/snow mix will be possible below this
elevation. While snow levels may rise close to 7,000 feet
Tuesday afternoon, they will quickly fall to valley floors by
Wednesday morning. Snow showers may continue to impact
northeastern California and western Nevada roadways through the
day on Wednesday. There is high confidence in the Sierra
(including pass levels) receiving at least 12 inches, and at
least impactful accumulations elsewhere across western Nevada.
Keep an eye out for the Wednesday morning commute. Please check
with CALTRANS and NDOT for the latest roadway conditions and be
sure to carry chains if you plan on venturing into the Sierra
during the middle part of next week as winter driving conditions
are likely.
* MUCH COLDER TEMPERATURES: The cold airmass will likely usher in
the season`s coldest temperatures thus far. High temperatures
will plummet some 15-25 degrees below average on Wednesday and
Thursday - struggling to get out of the 20s/30s in the Sierra
and 40s across western Nevada. With a light northwesterly breeze
during the afternoons, it will feel brisk out. Low temperatures
(particularly Thursday and Friday morning) look to be seasonably
cold. Teens and single digits will be common in Sierra valleys
and places like Bridgeport and Bodie could see sub-zero temps.
Now is the time to complete winter protections for exposed
irrigation equipment.</description>
