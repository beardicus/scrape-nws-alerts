BELOW 5000 FEET...
...HEAT ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM FRIDAY ABOVE 5000
FEET...
* WHAT...For the Excessive Heat Warning below 5000 feet, a high

population. For the Heat Advisory above 5000 feet, a moderate
risk of heat illness, especially for members of heat sensitive
groups.
* WHERE...Lincoln County including Caliente, Pioche, Panaca,
Hiko, and Rachel. Northwest Plateau including Colorado City,
Pipe Spring National Monument, Tuweep, Mt. Trumbull, and
Western Grand Canyon.
* WHEN...Through 8 PM Friday.
* IMPACTS...Extreme heat will significantly increase the
potential for heat-related illnesses, particularly for those
working or participating in outdoor activities.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Overnight lows will struggle to fall
below 80 degrees below 5000 feet. This, compounded with above-
average afternoon temperatures will pose a significant risk
for heat- related illness.</description>
<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
