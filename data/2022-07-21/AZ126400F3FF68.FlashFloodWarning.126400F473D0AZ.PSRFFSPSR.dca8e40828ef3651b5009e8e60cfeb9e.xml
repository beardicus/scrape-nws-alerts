<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING FOR THE TELEGRAPH BURN SCAR REMAINS IN EFFECT
UNTIL 10 PM MST THIS EVENING FOR GILA COUNTY...
At 702 PM MST, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated
thunderstorms produced heavy rain over the Telegraph Burn Scar.
Between 1 and 1.5 inches of rain have fallen. Webcams show
considerable flow in Six Shooter Canyon and Ice House Canyon. Beer
Tree Crossing in Globe experienced a rapid rise in runoff, over 1.5
feet. Flash flooding is already occurring.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through the Six Shooter Canyon, Ice House Canyon, Kellner
Canyon, and Russell Gulch. The debris flow can consist of rock, mud,
vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms producing
flash flooding in and around the Telegraph Burn Scar.
SOURCE...Radar and automated gauges.
IMPACT...Life threatening flash flooding of areas in and around
the Telegraph Burn Scar.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Globe, Central Heights-Midland City and Claypool.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR AND GAUGE INDICATED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.</instruction>
