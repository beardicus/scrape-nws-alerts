<description>...Patchy Dense Fog This Afternoon...
Fog is ongoing across eastern Contra Costa and northeast Alameda
Counties this afternoon. This includes the Antioch, Brentwood, and
Discovery Bay areas. Visibility reductions of 1/2 mile to locally
1/4 mile are possible. This fog should persist into the evening
hours and become increasingly dense with time. Driving will
become hazardous in these areas overnight due to very poor
visibility. The fog will persist into the Monday morning commute
hours.
Motorists are advised to drive with caution as visibilities may
widely vary over short distances. Use low beam headlights and
leave extra distance between your vehicle and others on the road
when encountering significant reductions in visibility. Allow
extra time to travel to destinations.</description>
