- At 151 AM EDT, Earlier thunderstorms produced 1 to 1.5
inches of rain across a narrow area including Paris and

in downstream areas, including Whitesboro. While flooding has
likely peaked in upstream areas, including Chadwicks, water
levels will continue to rise in downstream areas for another
hour or two.
Doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated heavy rain
due to thunderstorms. Flooding is ongoing or expected to
begin shortly in the warned area. Between 1 and 1.5 inches of
rain have fallen.
