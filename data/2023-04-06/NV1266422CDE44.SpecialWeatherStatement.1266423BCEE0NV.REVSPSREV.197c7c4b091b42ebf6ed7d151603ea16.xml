<description>...LIGHT SNOW PRODUCING SLICK TRAVEL FOR SIERRA PASSES FRIDAY
MORNING...
A weak storm system will move quickly across the Sierra and
northeast California late tonight and Friday, bringing increased
winds and a period of snow capable of producing slick travel
conditions and delays across the main Sierra passes through the
Friday morning commute.
* Winds: Most of the stronger winds will remain in higher
elevations, with ridge level gusts 65-75 mph late tonight and
Friday. For lower elevations, wind gusts of 25-35 mph are
expected.
* Snow: A period of snow will arrive early Friday morning, with
peak snowfall rates most likely between 4 and 9 AM. The main
Sierra passes including Fredonyer Summit, Yuba Pass, Donner and
Echo summits, and Carson Pass can expect accumulations of 3 to
6 inches through Friday morning. Lighter snowfall up to 2 inches
is possible across the remainder of the Lake Tahoe basin and
northeast California west of US-395 near and above 5500 feet.
If traveling across the Sierra Friday morning, be sure to allow
extra time to reach your destination. Leave extra space between
vehicles since it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.
Conditions are expected to improve from late morning through the
remainder of Friday as the snow diminishes to scattered snow
showers and higher April sun angles allow snow to melt on paved
surfaces.</description>
