SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
The center of broad and disorganized Potential Tropical Cyclone One
continues to move northeast toward the southwest Florida coast early
this morning. Rain, embedded squalls and a few thunderstorms continue
to push across the southern half of Florida, well ahead of the center.
Thus far the heaviest rainfall has been confined south of Lake
Okeechobee, and offshore over the adjacent Atlantic waters, with the
highest storm totals thus far estimated between one and two inches
across Martin and Okeechobee Counties.
The system is forecast to reach the southwest coast of Florida this
morning, then move move across the southern peninsula and offshore the
east coast and into the Atlantic around sunset. It is no longer
forecast to become a tropical cyclone as it moves across Florida.
However, locally heavy rainfall, and breezy to windy conditions will
remain possible, especially in any lingering showers or and squalls.
Hazardous winds and seas will continue over the near shore Atlantic
into this evening.
Additional rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches with locally higher
amounts are possible, mainly along the coast of Martin, Saint Lucie
and Indian River Counties. To the north, less than an inch of
additional rainfall is expected, however, any showers or lightning
storms that may develop could produce a quick inch or two in a few
locations.
A brief tornado may occur from Cape Canaveral and Okeechobee southeast
across the counties of the Space and Treasure Coasts through the early
afternoon. Storm surge is not expected from this system.
As the broad center moves across the state later this afternoon,
conditions will begin to improve over land, since all of the
associated rain and squalls are occurring well to the east of the
center. Winds and seas will begin to subside offshore later tonight.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across the
Lake Okeechobee and Treasure Coast regions. Remain well guarded against
dangerous flood waters having possible significant impacts.If realized
these impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt some evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may become swollen and overspill their
banks in a few places, especially in usually vulnerable spots.
Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding from
Brevard and Osceola Counties south to Lake Okeechobee and Tequesta.
Remain sheltered from hazardous wind having gusts having possible
limited impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Some large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Isolated power and communications outages.
* TORNADOES:
Potential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across the area.
Remain well braced against a tornado event having possible limited
impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
If you are a visitor, be sure to know the name of the city or town in
which you are staying and the name of the county in which it resides.
Listen for these locations in local news updates. Pay attention for
instructions from local authorities.
Do not venture outside during hazardous weather. Do not be a thrill
seeker or risk your life for photos or videos.
If you are prone to flooding or in an area under a storm surge watch
or warning, be prepared for the possibility of a quick rise in water
levels.
If a tornado warning is issued for your area, quickly move to the
safest place within your shelter. Protect your head and body.
