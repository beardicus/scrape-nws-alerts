SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
A Tropical Storm Warning remains in effect for all Florida Keys and
surrounding waters.
At 500 AM EDT, the center of the very disorganized and highly
asymmetric potential tropical cyclone was centered about 110 nm
northwest of Key West. Virtually all of the wind and weather is located
well east of the center. The system will continue to move through our
deep Gulf waters this morning, then out across southern and central
Florida today. An inhospitable environment should prevent any
organization before making land fall on the Florida mainland gulf
coast. Regardless, rain and squalls will continue to affect portions of
the Florida Keys today.
There is a potential risk for multiple hazards for the Florida Keys,
including flooding rainfall, tropical storm force winds, particularly
in squalls, isolated tornadoes, and treacherous marine conditions.
Small craft should remain in port.
While showers can be expected along the length of the Keys, most of
the heavy rain will be concentrated along the Upper Keys today. Storm
total rainfall is expected to be 4 to 8 inches with localized areas
near 10 inches. The storm total accumulations thus far are already
fairly close to this estimate and another 2 to 3 inches will be
possible in the Upper Keys through this evening.
A few tornadoes will be possible today.
There is potential for minor coastal flooding of 1 to 2 feet above
mean sea level along the Gulfside/Bayside today, especially over the
bayside communities in the Upper Keys. Significant oceanside wave
overwash is expected today, most evident around the times of higher
high tide.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across Upper Keys. Potential impacts include:
- Rainfall flooding may prompt evacuations and rescues.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.
Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with
underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.
Many road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
Prepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant
impacts across the Upper Keys.
Elsewhere across the Florida Keys, little to no impact is anticipated.
* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across the
Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
the Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
* COASTAL FLOODING:
Sustained strong to tropical storm force southerly to southwesterly
winds will result in minor coastal flooding of 1 to 2 feet along the
Bayside and Gulfside this evening through this afternoon. Significant
oceanside wave overwash is expected today, most evident around the
times of higher high tide.
- Localized flooding mainly along immediate shorelines and in low-
lying spots.
- Driving conditions dangerous over flooded roads.
- Moderate beach erosion.
- Minor damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. A few
small craft broken away from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
No mandatory evacuations are in effect expected for this storm.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Ensure you are in a safe location from strong winds or possible
flooding.
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
in a low-lying or poor drainage area, plan to move to safe shelter on
higher ground.
If a Tornado Warning is issued for your area, be ready to shelter
quickly, preferably away from windows and in an interior room not
prone to flooding. If driving, scan the roadside for quick shelter
options.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
