SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
The center of broad and disorganized Potential Tropical Cyclone One
has moved onshore the southwest Florida coast this morning and will
continue northeastward and offshore the Treasure Coast later this
afternoon. As this system moves farther away from the east coast of
Florida late tonight into Sunday morning, it is expected to to
become a tropical storm and strengthen, with a continued
northeastward movement away from the area.
Rain, embedded squalls and a few thunderstorms will continue to push
across Brevard County and the Treasure Coast through this afternoon.
Thus far the heaviest rainfall has been confined to the Treasure
Coast, with localized higher totals of 3 to 6 inches near to east of
Interstate 95 in these areas. Strong gusts to 40 to 45 mph have also
occurred along the immediate coast, south of Sebastian Inlet this
morning.
Locally heavy rainfall, and breezy to windy conditions will remain
possible, especially in any lingering showers and squalls. Hazardous
winds and seas will continue over the near shore Atlantic into this
evening.
Additional rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches with locally higher
amounts are possible, mainly along the coast of Brevard, Martin, Saint
Lucie and Indian River Counties. To the north, and inland across east
central Florida less than an inch of additional rainfall is expected.
However, any showers or lightning storms that may develop could
produce a quick inch or two in a few locations.
A brief tornado may occur south of Cape Canaveral along the Space and
Treasure Coasts through early this afternoon. Storm surge is not
expected from this system.
As the broad center moves across the state and offshore this
afternoon, conditions will begin to improve over land, since all of
the associated rain and squalls are occurring well to the east of the
center. Winds and seas will begin to subside offshore later tonight.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
Indian River, Saint Lucie and Martin counties. Remain well guarded
against dangerous flood waters having possible significant impacts.If
realized these impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt some evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may become swollen and overspill their
banks in a few places, especially in usually vulnerable spots.
Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding from
Brevard County southward through the Treasure Coast.
Remain sheltered from hazardous wind having gusts having possible
limited impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Some large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Isolated power and communications outages.
* TORNADOES:
Potential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across the area.
Remain well braced against a tornado event having possible limited
impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS

which you are staying and the name of the county in which it resides.
Listen for these locations in local news updates. Pay attention for
instructions from local authorities.
Do not venture outside during hazardous weather. Do not be a thrill
seeker or risk your life for photos or videos.

quick rise in water levels.
If a tornado warning is issued for your area, quickly move to the
safest place within your shelter. Protect your head and body.
