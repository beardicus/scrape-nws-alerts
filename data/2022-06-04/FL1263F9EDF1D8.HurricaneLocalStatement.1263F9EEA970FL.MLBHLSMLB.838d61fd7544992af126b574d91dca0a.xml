SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
The center of broad and disorganized Potential Tropical Cyclone One
is now located just southwest of Fort Pierce and will push offshore
late this afternoon into this evening.
Rain and embedded squalls will continue to push across Brevard County
and the Treasure Coast through this afternoon. The heaviest rainfall
has been confined to the Treasure Coast, with localized higher totals
of 5 to 7 inches near Vero Beach. Strong gusts to 40 to 45 mph have
also occurred along the immediate coast from Brevard County southward.
Locally heavy rainfall, and breezy to windy conditions will remain
possible, especially in any lingering showers and squalls. Hazardous
winds and seas will continue over the near shore Atlantic into this
evening.
As the broad center moves offshore this afternoon, conditions will
continue to improve over land. Winds and seas will begin to subside
offshore later tonight.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
Indian River, Saint Lucie and Martin counties. Remain well guarded
against dangerous flood waters having possible significant impacts.If
realized these impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt some evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may become swollen and overspill their
banks in a few places, especially in usually vulnerable spots.
Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid inundation
at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage areas. Some
streets and parking lots take on moving water as storm drains and
retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions become hazardous.
Some road and bridge closures.
Elsewhere across East Central Florida, little to no impact is
anticipated.
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding from
Brevard County southward through the Treasure Coast. Remain sheltered
from hazardous wind having gusts having possible limited impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Some large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Isolated power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across East Central Florida, little to no impact is
anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
