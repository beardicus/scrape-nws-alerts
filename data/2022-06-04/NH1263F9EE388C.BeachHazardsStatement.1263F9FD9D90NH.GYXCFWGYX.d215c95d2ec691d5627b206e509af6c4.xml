<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY MORNING
THROUGH SUNDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Please check with state and local authorities regarding
guidelines for allowed activities. The warm air temperatures in
the upper 60s to lower 70s may cause people to underestimate the
dangers of the cold water temperatures, which are currently only
in the lower 50s.
* WHERE...In New Hampshire, Coastal Rockingham County. In Maine,
Coastal York, Coastal Cumberland, Sagadahoc, Lincoln, Knox and
Coastal Waldo Counties.
* WHEN...From Sunday morning through Sunday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...The cold water temperatures can quickly cause
hypothermia to anyone immersed in the water. When the water
temperature is below 60 degrees, the average submerged person
could lose dexterity within minutes and be unable to accomplish
simple tasks. Anyone on boats or paddlecraft should use extreme
caution to avoid this threat.</description>
<instruction>A Beach Hazards Statement is issued on days when a significant
number of boats and paddlecraft are expected to be out on the
water and when warm air temperatures may cause people to
underestimate the danger of the cold water. Paddle smart from the
start. Always wear your life jacket. Be aware of wind conditions,
tides, and localized currents.</instruction>
