<headline>Special Weather Statement issued June 04 at 3:00PM MDT  by NWS GreatFalls</headline>
<description>...A thunderstorm will impact portions of east central Broadwater
and south central Meagher Counties through 330 PM MDT...
At 255 PM MDT, Doppler radar was tracking a thunderstorm 15 miles
southwest of White Sulphur Springs, moving northeast at 10 mph.
HAZARD...Winds in excess of 30 mph and pea size hail, along with
brief heavy rain.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around
unsecured objects. Minor damage to outdoor objects is
possible.
ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The brief heavy rainfall may cause minor debris
flow out of the east facing slopes of the southern Big Belt
Mountains. However, this is just outside of the Deep Creek
burn scar area, so significant flooding is NOT expected at
this time.
This storm will remain over mainly rural areas of east central
Broadwater and south central Meagher Counties.
This includes the following highways...
Highway 12 between mile markers 18 and 37.
Highway 89 between mile markers 48 and 57.
MAX HAIL SIZE...0.25 IN
MAX WIND GUST...30 MPH</description>
<instruction>If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.
This storm may intensify, so be certain to monitor local radio
stations and available television stations for additional information
and possible warnings from the National Weather Service.
To report severe weather, contact your nearest law enforcement
agency. They will relay your report to the National Weather Service
office in Great Falls.</instruction>
