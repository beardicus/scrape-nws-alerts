<description>...Brief Landspout Tornadoes Possible...
At 406 PM MDT, conditions are becoming favorable for the development
of landspout tornadoes near the Kit Carson and Cheyenne county line.
The public reported a potential landspout that had dissipated in
this area.  Any landspouts which develop are expected to pose a
limited threat. At this time it is uncertain if any additional
landspout could form in this area.
This landspout threat will remain over mainly rural areas of south
central Kit Carson County and north central Cheyenne County Counties
in east central Colorado.
Landspout tornadoes can form with a developing thunderstorm before
rain, hail, and even thunder is observed. Landspout tornadoes are not
usually associated with a wall cloud and are often difficult to
detect with weather radar.
