<headline>Flood Watch issued October 27 at 9:21AM AST  by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM AST THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH MONDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.
* WHEN...From 2 PM AST this afternoon through Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Plenty of tropical moisture and favorable upper-level
conditions will bring periods of showers and thunderstorms
across the local islands through at least Tuesday. However,
wet conditions are possible Wednesday through Friday next
week.
Based on the most recent guidance, scattered to numerous
showers and isolated thunderstorms will reach the US Virgin
Islands later this afternoon and tonight, and across the rest
of the forecast area by Saturday. Periods of showers will
continue to prevail on Sunday as well. The areas most likely
to receive the highest rainfall accumulations are the
interior, eastern and southern sections of Puerto Rico as
well as the US Virgin Islands. In these areas, there is the
potential for rainfall totals of 3-8 inches through at least
Tuesday. Elsewhere across Puerto Rico, rainfall totals of 3-5
inches are possible.
There is an elevated risk for flooding of urban areas,roads
and small streams. Life threatening flash flooding and
mudslides are possible as well. Some rivers will likely
overflow their banks. As a result the Flash Flood Watch is in
effect through at least Monday morning.
