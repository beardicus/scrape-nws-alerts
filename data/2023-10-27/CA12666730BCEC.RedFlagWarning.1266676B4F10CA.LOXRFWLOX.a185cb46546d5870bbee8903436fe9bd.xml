<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH 10
PM MONDAY EVENING FOR GUSTY SANTA ANA WINDS AND VERY LOW RELATIVE
HUMIDITY FOR MUCH OF LOS ANGELES AND VENTURA COUNTIES...
.Our first significant Santa Ana wind event of the season will
likely bring critical Red Flag conditions to wind prone areas of
Los Angeles and Ventura counties late Saturday night into Monday
evening. The onset of Santa Ana winds will bring rapid drying to
the region late Saturday night, with widespread single digit
humidities Sunday into Monday. The strongest Santa Ana winds are
expected Sunday, when gusts of 35 to 50 mph will be common, except
gusts of 50 to 65 mph likely in the Los Angeles county mountains,
Santa Susana mountains, western Santa Monicas, and wind prone
foothills. Dry and breezy offshore flow conditions will persist
into Tuesday which may extend critical fire weather conditions
across portions of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. While not
currently in the warning area, interior portions of San Luis
Obispo and Santa Barbara counties will see elevated to brief
critical fire weather conditions Sunday into Monday.
