<description>...HEAVY RAIN WITH RISING SNOW LEVELS LATE WEEK IN UPPER LYNN
CANAL...
An atmospheric river late this week into the weekend will bring
warming temperatures, rising snow levels, the potential for
accumulating snow changing to heavy rain, and the possibility of
flooding. Please review the Flood Watch now in effect for Upper
Lynn Canal.
A short break in the weather is possible Thursday afternoon
through Thursday evening before heavy precipitation moves in
Thursday night. Precipitation will be mainly rain at sea level.
Precipitation begins as snow along the highways near the border
and will hang on longer along the South Klondike Highway. Rainfall
amounts of 3 to 4 inches are possible from Thursday night through
Saturday night. Snowfall amounts of 6 inches are possible out the
Haines highway and up to 12 inches at White Pass with lower
amounts at lower elevations. Snow levels are forecast to rise to
around 2,500 feet or higher which could lead to a melting mountain
snowpack and introduce some nuisance flooding concerns. Rain at
White Pass is not out of the question. Rain over deep snow on top
of structures and rooftops could challenge load limits across
Upper Lynn Canal. Please stay tuned to local updates should
further flood bulletins be issued.</description>
