<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM THIS
EVENING TO 6 PM CST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Lake effect snow expected, falling heavily at times,
with totals of 3 to 7 inches expected and locally higher
totals possible as lake effect snow often varies greatly over
short distances.
* WHERE...Porter County, especially northeast of a line from
Portage to Kouts, including Valparaiso.
* WHEN...From 6 PM CST this evening to 6 PM CST Thursday, with
the heaviest snowfall rates of one inch per hour or greater
expected at times overnight and Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions and rapid drops in
visibility. Travel could become very difficult in places. The
hazardous conditions will impact the Thursday morning commute,
including along the Interstate 80, 90, and 94 corridors.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Breezy northerly winds could cause
blowing and drifting snow and further reduce visibility when
combined with heavy snowfall rates.</description>

caution.
