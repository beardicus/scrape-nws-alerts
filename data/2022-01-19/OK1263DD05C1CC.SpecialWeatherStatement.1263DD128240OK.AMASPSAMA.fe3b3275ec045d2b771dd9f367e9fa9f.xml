<description>...LIGHT SNOWFALL FOR THE PANHANDLES...
A low pressure system centered over New Mexico will bring
snowfall chances to the Panhandles starting late this evening and
continuing into tomorrow morning.
The precipitation should start in the northern OK Panhandle this
evening before moving south-southeast into the remainder of the
combined Panhandles tonight into the early morning hours
tomorrow. Snowfall will then dissipate over portions of the
central Texas Panhandle mid to late morning as remnant snow
showers.
Snowfall amounts will range from a Trace in the eastern Panhandles
to around one inch with locally higher amounts from Vega to Dumas
to Guymon and points north and west. Best chances for any
snowfall accumulations will be in the far northwestern Panhandles
near the New Mexico and Colorado state lines.
Wind chill values will be in the single digits to around zero
degrees by tomorrow morning. Cold conditions along with snowfall
may bring some impacts to the Thursday morning commute. High
temperatures tomorrow are expected to not get above freezing for
the majority of the combined Panhandles.
