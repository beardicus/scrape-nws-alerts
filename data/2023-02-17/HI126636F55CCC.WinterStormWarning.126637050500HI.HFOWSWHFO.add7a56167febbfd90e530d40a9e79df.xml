.Deep moisture will continue stream over the area during the next
couple of days, and with temperatures hovering near or below
freezing over the highest elevations of the Big Island, a mix of
heavy snow and freezing rain will persist through at least
Saturday afternoon. Travel to the summits is extremely dangerous,
with roads snow covered and icy. Additionally, gusty winds will
produce widespread blowing and drifting snow, as well as near-zero
visibility at times.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM HST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow and freezing rain. Over a foot of additional
snow expected along with significant icing. Winds gusting to
around 50 mph.
* WHERE...Big Island Summits.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM HST Saturday, though hazardous winter weather
may continue into Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Travel to the summits will be life-threatening and
impossible, and the road to the Mauna Kea summit remains
closed. Blowing snow will significantly reduce visibility at
times, with periods of zero visibility.</description>

and ice are expected or occurring. Strong winds are also
possible. This will make travel very hazardous or impossible. Any
travel plans to the summits should be postponed until the threat
diminishes.</instruction>
