<description>...COLD AND STORMY WINTER WEATHER RETURNS NEXT WEEK...
While the upcoming holiday weekend will feature dry and mild
conditions, a much colder weather pattern with periods of stronger
winds and snow will return next week starting Tuesday. Now is the
time to prepare homes and vehicles for winter conditions, and
consider alternate travel plans especially in the Sierra next week
due to potentially long delays as these storms move through.
* WINDS: The strongest winds are most likely on Tuesday. A cold
front dropping in from the north will bring gusty southwest to
west winds. Wind gusts of 40-50 mph appear likely, with possible
stronger gusts surpassing 60 mph in wind prone areas or near the
cold front. Sierra ridges could receive gusts in excess of 100
mph. Brisk winds will continue at times through Wednesday and
Thursday as additional weather systems move through. These winds
will bring rough waters on area lakes, difficult driving
conditions especially in high profile vehicles, and significant
turbulence or wind shear concerns for air travel.
* SNOW: Periods of snow and snow showers will arrive by Tuesday
afternoon or evening across the Sierra, northeast California and
northwest Nevada. Additional rounds of snow are possible
Wednesday through Friday mainly for the Sierra, with scattered
snow showers at times for lower elevations. While snowfall
amounts and accumulation rates currently don`t appear to be
excessive, it will be cold enough at all elevations for any
snowfall to produce hazardous travel conditions, especially at
night. Higher elevations of the Sierra could receive totals of
1-2 feet spread across the Tuesday through Thursday time frame,
with a few inches up to 1 foot possible around Lake Tahoe, parts
of northeast California and western Mono County. For lower
elevations of western Nevada and eastern California, lesser snow
amounts are anticipated, but a band of rain and snow along the
cold front could produce icy patches and travel impacts for the
Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning commutes.
* COLD TEMPERATURES: After a relatively warm day Monday, sharply
colder temperatures will return by late Tuesday and continue
through much of next week. Highs for Wednesday and Thursday are
only expected to reach the 30s for most lower elevations and 20s
for Sierra valleys, about 15-20 degrees colder than average. The
coldest lows are most likely Wednesday night, mainly in the
teens for most lower elevations, with single digits to sub-zero
temperatures in colder Sierra valleys. Brisk winds will make it
feel even colder, with wind chills between zero and 10 degrees
at times for western Nevada and from -10 to -30 degrees for
higher Sierra elevations, producing dangerous health risks for
backcountry activities. Have layers of winter clothing ready by
next Tuesday, and be sure to protect vulnerable populations as
well as pets.</description>
