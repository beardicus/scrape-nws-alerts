<description>...National Weather Service Cold Water Safety Message...
...Please check with state and local authorities regarding
guidelines for allowed activities...
* The warm air temperatures this weekend in the upper 80s to low 90s
may cause people to underestimate the dangers of the cold water
temperatures, which are currently only in the mid 50s across Lake
Champlain and in the upper 50s in the region`s smaller lakes and
rivers.
* The cold water temperatures can quickly cause hypothermia to
anyone immersed in the water. When the water temperature is below
60 degrees, the average submerged person could lose dexterity
within minutes and be unable to accomplish simple tasks. Anyone
on small boats, canoes or kayaks should plan accordingly if
recreating this weekend and use extreme caution to avoid this
threat. Paddle smart from the start and always wear your life
jacket!
* Strong winds are also expected this morning with gusts up to 25
mph from the southwest. If boating on large bodies of water, these
strong winds can increase the likelihood of overturning your
boat,canoe or kayak due to increased wave heights.</description>
