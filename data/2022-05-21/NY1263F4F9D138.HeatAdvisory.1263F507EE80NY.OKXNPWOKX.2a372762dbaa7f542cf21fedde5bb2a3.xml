<instruction>New York City residents should call 3 1 1 to identify cooling
center locations and obtain `Beat the Heat` safety tips.
A Heat Advisory is issued when the combination of heat and
humidity is expected to make it feel like it is 95 to 99 degrees
for two or more consecutive days, or 100 to 104 degrees for any
length of time.
Seniors and those with chronic health problems or mental health
conditions are at an increased risk. Homes without air
conditioning can be much hotter than outdoor temperatures.
Use air conditioning to stay cool at home or go to a place that
has air conditioning. Check on vulnerable friends, family members
and neighbors.
To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent rest breaks
in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone overcome by
heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location. Heat stroke
is an emergency! In cases of heat stroke call 9 1 1.
If driving, slow down, use your headlights, and leave plenty of
distance ahead of you.</instruction>
