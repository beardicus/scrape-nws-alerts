<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY FOR SNOWMELT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 145 PM AKDT
MONDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by snowmelt continues.
* WHERE...Including the following area, Copper River Basin.
* WHEN...Until 145 PM AKDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding of Moose Creek and low-lying and poor
drainage areas in Glennallen, minor flooding on the Gulkana River,
and flooding of the Lake Louise Road are occurring. Expect rises
and near-bankfull conditions on other rivers and streams in the
area, including the Gakona River.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 439 PM AKDT, river gauge reports indicate rises in water
levels from snowmelt in the advisory area. Minor flooding is
ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
- Above normal temperatures rising into the upper 60s this
weekend in the Copper River Basin will increase higher
elevation snowmelt. Much of the Eastern Alaska Range had a
record amount of snow on the ground for mid-May. Significant
snowmelt runoff this weekend will move down into rivers and
streams in the Northern Copper River Basin, including Moose
Creek in Glennallen, the Gulkana River, and into the Lake
Louise drainage basin.
On Thursday morning, DOT officials reported that Moose Creek
in Glennallen had jumped its bank and split into two channels
and is impacting roads and buildings in the Glennallen area
north of the Glenn Highway.
Water levels are climbing in the Lake Louise Road area due to
increasing snowmelt rates in the area. Water has overtopped
the road and has blocked access to the lodge and the
airstrip.
- For Gulkana River at Sourdough:
At 4:30pm the stage was 11.73 feet.
Flood Stage is 11.0 feet.
Forecast: A crest around 12.1 feet is expected around 4:00am
Monday.
