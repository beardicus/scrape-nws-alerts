<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM MDT SUNDAY...
The New Mexico Departments of Health and Environment has issued an
Air Quality Alert, until 1 PM MDT Sunday.
An Air Quality Alert for Smoke has been issued.
* WHAT... A shallow dome of unseasonably cool air along and east of
the central mountain chain this afternoon will be reinforced by
early evening with the leading edge of this cooler air advancing
much farther west and south than this past nightpossibly as far
west as the Continental Divide by Sunday morning. Smoke from the
highest elevations of Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon fire will initially
be transported to the east-northeast while very little eastward
smoke transport is expected at the lower elevations. However,
beginning late today or early evening, any smoke along the east
slopes of the Sangre de Cristos will be pushed back toward the west
and northwest. There is the potential for smoke impacts to increase
and expand along the Rio Grande Valley west of the Sangre de
Cristos, as well as areas south and southwest of the Hermits Peak
Calf Canyon fire perimeter to include Pecos Canyon, Glorieta and
Santa Fe during the evening and overnight. Meanwhile, across the
Gila National Forest and surrounding areas, significantly drier
west-southwest transport winds will prevail through the evening
with smoke transport toward the east-northeast. Thereafter, smoke
from the Black and Bear Trap fires will tend to push more toward
the north-northwest then back to the northeast going into Sunday.
Smoke from other wildfires and localized blowing dust will
contribute to increasingly hazy skies especially for the middle Rio
Grande Valley corridor.
* WHERE...Locations most likely to experience the most significant
impacts from smoke include the following counites: Catron, western
Colfax, northwest Lincoln, western Mora, southeastern Rio Arriba,
eastern Sandoval, western San Miguel, northern Santa Fe, Socorro,
Taos, southwest Torrance. More details on impacted locations and
latest air quality information can be found at
https://fire.airnow.gov
* WHEN... Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1pm MDT
Sunday, May 22
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method
available at
https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
