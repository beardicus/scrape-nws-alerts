<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam is possible.
* WHERE...The Buckland River downstream of Buckland, just beyond the
end of the runway.
* WHEN...Through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...An official in Buckland reports an ice jam has formed
downstream of the village just beyond the end of the runway and
extending downriver past the location of last year`s ice jam.
The river has risen 8 ft during the day and is only 4 ft from
bankfull. Local reports and satellite imagery show there is still
lots of ice upstream that hasn`t moved down river yet. If the jam
does not break, village officials believe the river may overtop
its banks and begin flooding the village Saturday night or Sunday.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- An ice jam may cause water to infiltrate the lowlands along
the river.
