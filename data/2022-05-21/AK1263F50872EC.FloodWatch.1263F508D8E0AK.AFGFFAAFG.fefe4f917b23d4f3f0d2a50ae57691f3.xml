<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues to be possible.
* WHERE...Including the following area, Lower Yukon Valley.
* WHEN...Through Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...A large ice jam upriver from Grayling will release a
significant volume of water when the ice jam breaks. Residents in
Grayling, Anvik, Holy Cross, and Russian Mission will see a rapid
rise in water levels when the ice jam releases. Water levels may
rise to bankfull in some locations along with bank to bank runs of
ice moving downriver.
Additionally, the ice jam upriver from Grayling is causing a
significant amount of water to flow over the banks of the Yukon
River and into the Innoko River. River levels on the Innoko will
continue to rise while the ice jam is in place.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- An ice jam may cause water to infiltrate the lowlands along
the river.
