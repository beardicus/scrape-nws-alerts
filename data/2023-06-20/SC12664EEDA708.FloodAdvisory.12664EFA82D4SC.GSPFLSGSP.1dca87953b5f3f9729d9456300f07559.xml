<headline>Flood Advisory issued June 20 at 12:18PM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 615 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Nuisance to Minor flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
expected.
* WHERE...A portion of upstate South Carolina, including the
following counties, Oconee and Pickens.
* WHEN...Until 615 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance to Minor flooding of low-lying areas adjacent
to streams and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland,
greenways, parks, boat-access areas, low-water crossings,
low-lying roadways, and hiking trails adjacent to streams.  High
flows over low-water crossings and low-lying roadways are possible
and water may approach low-lying structures.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1216 PM EDT, New rounds of heavy rainfall are develop over
Lake Jocassee, Lake Keowee, and adjacent small streams and
tributaries flowing into the lakes, including Eastatoee
Creek.  Another 1-2 inches of rain is expected over the next
1-2 hours on top of 2-4 inches of rain that has already
fallen since midnight.  This is causing high streamflows and
may impact vulnerable areas including low-water crossings and
adjacent farmland and low-lying areas.
- Showers and thunderstorms will continue to develop through
the afternoon hours.  These showers will be very efficient at
producing heavy rainfall and soils are saturated.  Therefore,
additional heavy rain will quickly create new areas of
flooding and cause previous areas of flooding to redevelop.
Caution is advised near any stream or other vulnerable area.
Hikers are urged to stay away from any stream.  Seek higher
ground immediately when heavy rain develops.  Flash Flood
Warnings may be issued during the day and into the nighttime
hours.  Please have a plan in place should flash flooding
develop and do not hesitate to act.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Salem, Keowee Toxaway State Park, Jocassee Gorges, Devils
Fork State Park, Gorges State Park, Table Rock State Park,
Nine Times, Sunset, Rocky Bottom, and Bad Creek.</description>
<instruction>In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
