<headline>Flood Advisory issued June 20 at 9:35PM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM EDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Cabarrus County, North Carolina along Coddle Creek and
Irish Buffalo Creek from Kannapolis to Pharr Mill and Rocky River
from Harrisburg to Georgeville.
* WHEN...Until 900 AM EDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, greenways,
parks, boat-access areas, golf courses, low-water crossings, and
low-lying roadways.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 915 PM EDT, Coddle Creek, Irish Buffalo Creek, and Rocky
River remain elevated following earlier torrential rainfall,
which produced 2-4 inches of rainfall in 2-3 hours across
northern Cabarrus County and southern Rowan County.  Storm-
total rainfall since yesterday has reached 4-6 inches with
isolated totals approaching 7 inches in this area.  This has
caused Coddle Creek, Irish Buffalo Creek, and Rocky River to
exceed Action/Advisory Stage, causing nuisance to minor
flooding of adjacent low-lying areas.
The streamgauge on Coddle Creek near Davidson crested at
15.02 feet at 7:45pm.  Action/Advisory Stage is 12.5 feet.
Coddle Creek is currently falling steadily.  At 13.5 feet
floodwaters are impacting low-lying areas near Archer Bridge
Rd.  Coddle Creek is expected to fall below Action/Advisory
Stage during the overnight hours.
The streamgauge on Rocky River between Pharr Mill and
Georgeville is at 14.85 feet and is rising steadily.  At
these levels Rocky River is flooding primarily adjacent low-
lying areas including farmland and woodland.  Nuisance
flooding at Pharr Mill Park is also likely.  Backwater
effects may be impacting Pharr Mill Rd.  Action/Advisory
Stage is 12.0 feet.  Minor Flood Stage is 16.5 feet.  Rocky
River is expected to crest below 16.0 feet overnight tonight
and slowly fall below Action/Advisory Stage later tomorrow.
- Some locations that may continue to experience flooding
include...
Kannapolis, Downtown Concord, West Concord, Harrisburg, and
Enochville.</description>
