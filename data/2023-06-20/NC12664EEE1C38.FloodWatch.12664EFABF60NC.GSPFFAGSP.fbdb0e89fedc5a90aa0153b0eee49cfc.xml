<headline>Flood Watch issued June 20 at 3:18PM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of the foothills and mountains of North Carolina,
including the following areas, in piedmont North Carolina,
Alexander. In western North Carolina, Avery, Buncombe, Burke
Mountains, Caldwell Mountains, Eastern McDowell, Eastern Polk,
Greater Burke, Greater Caldwell, Greater Rutherford, Henderson,
McDowell Mountains, Mitchell, Polk Mountains, Rutherford Mountains
and Yancey.
* WHEN...Through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A low pressure system persisting near the southern
Appalachians will keep deep moisture in place over the
region. Numerous rounds of showers and thunderstorms will
develop over the area tonight, tomorrow, and likely into
Thursday, bringing periods of very heavy rainfall. An
additional 3 to 8 inches of rain will be possible over parts
of the North Carolina mountains and foothills through
Thursday, falling on areas that have already received several
inches of rain over the past 24 hours. This will make ongoing
flooding worsen and likely cause new flash flooding to
develop. The threat of landslides has increased along and
near the Blue Ridge Escarpment because of the heavy rain over
the last 24 hours.

<instruction>A Flood Watch for flash flooding means there is a potential for
rapid onset flooding based on current forecasts. Flash flooding is a
very dangerous situation and may impact areas that do not typically
flood. Please monitor the latest forecasts and be prepared to take
action quickly should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.
Rainfall of more than five inches in similar storms has been
associated with an increased risk of landslides and rockslides. If
you live on a mountainside or in a cove at the base of a mountain,
especially near a stream, be ready to leave in advance of the storm
or as quickly as possible should rising water, moving earth, or
rocks threaten. Consider postponing travel along mountain roads
during periods of heavy rainfall.</instruction>
