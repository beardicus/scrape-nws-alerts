<description>...RIVER RISES DUE TO MELTING SNOWPACK...

THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS HAS RESULTED IN EXCESSIVE SNOWMELT AT HIGHER
ELEVATIONS. AS A RESULT, WATER LEVELS IN RIVERS AND STREAMS THAT
HAVE THEIR ORIGINS IN THE MOUNTAINS HAVE BEEN RISING SINCE THIS
PAST SUNDAY AND CONTINUE TO RISE TODAY. GREATEST RATES OF RISE ARE
OCCURRING FROM LATE EVENING TO EARLY MORNING. WITH ONE MORE DAY OF
VERY WARM DAYTIME HIGHS, RIVERS AND STREAMS ARE EXPECTED TO RISE
ONCE AGAIN THIS EVENING AND MAY APPROACH BANKFULL LEVELS.
THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY REGARDING EXACTLY HOW HIGH THE
TAIYA AND CHILKAT RIVERS WILL RISE, AS THE REMAINING AMOUNT OF HIGH
ELEVATION SNOWPACK IS UNKNOWN.
A HYDROLOGIC ADVISORY IS ISSUED WHEN SIGNIFICANT RIVER RISES ARE
EXPECTED OR OCCURRING, BUT FLOOD IS NOT EXPECTED.
