<headline>Flood Advisory issued June 20 at 1:02PM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of western North Carolina, including the
following county, Caldwell.
* WHEN...Until 700 PM EDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance to Minor flooding of low-lying areas adjacent
to streams and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland,
greenways, parks, boat-access areas, low-water crossings,
low-lying roadways, and hiking trails adjacent to streams.  High
flows over low-water crossings and low-lying roadways are possible
and water may approach low-lying structures.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1253 PM EDT, Multiple rounds of showers and thunderstorms
have produced 3-6 inches of rainfall since last night across
central and western Caldwell County.  Streams are elevated
and soils are saturated, causing nuisance to Minor flooding
of low-lying areas.
Emergency management and automated streamgauges are reporting
high flows along the headwaters of Johns River from Upton to
Globe to Collettsville and along Wilson Creek from
Grandfather Mountain to Edgemont to Adako.  The streamgauge
along Wilson Creek at Adako Rd has risen to 4.6 feet and is
now steady.  Additional rises of Wilson Creek are possible as
new rounds of rain are training over the watershed.  Minor
flooding is expected to develop over the next few hours.
More significant flooding is possible and a Flash Flood
Warning may be required.  Now is the time to take action and
relocate to higher ground until the heavy rain threat passes.
- Showers and thunderstorms will continue to develop through
the afternoon hours.  These showers will be very efficient at
producing heavy rainfall and soils are saturated.  Therefore,
additional heavy rain will quickly create new areas of
flooding and cause previous areas of flooding to redevelop.
Caution is advised near any stream or other vulnerable area.
Hikers are urged to stay away from any stream.  Seek higher
ground immediately when heavy rain develops.  Flash Flood
Warnings may be issued during the day and into the nighttime
hours.  Please have a plan in place should flash flooding
develop and do not hesitate to act.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Lenoir, Gamewell, Hudson, Cajah`s Mountain, Blowing Rock In
Caldwell County, Cedar Rock, Lake Rhodhiss, Grandfather
Mountain State Park, B.R. Parkway-Linville Falls To
Grandfather, Patterson, Collettsville, Upton, Globe, Edgemont
and Kings Creek.</description>
<instruction>In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
