<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM EDT THIS
EVENING FOR CABARRUS COUNTY...
At 549 PM EDT, Emergency management is reporting several water
rescues in the Kannapolis area.  Thirty people were evacuated from a
mobile home park along Irish Buffalo Creek at Tiffany Drive.  No
injuries occurred.  Numerous roads are closed due to flooding in the
vicinity including Louise Ave, Marie Ave, Waldorf Dr, Mable Ave,
22nd St, Pine St, Cadillac St, and Pump Station Rd.
* Spillage at Lake Kannapolis Dam continues to increase, causing
significant flows into Irish Buffalo Creek.  These flows will
continue to cause flooding of downstream locations along the
creek, including C Street, Pump Station Rd, Tiffany Drive,
Hunterridge Lane, Pine Street, and Rainbow Drive.
* Exercise extreme caution when traveling in the Kannapolis area.
Avoid all flooded roadways and obey all barricades.  Stay away
from all streams, but especially Irish Buffalo Creek.  Significant
flows will sweep away cars and persons caught in the flood waters.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms producing
flash flooding.
