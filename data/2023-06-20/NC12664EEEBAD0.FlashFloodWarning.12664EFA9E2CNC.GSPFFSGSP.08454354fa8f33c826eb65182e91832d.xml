<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 915 PM EDT THIS
EVENING FOR SOUTHERN IREDELL AND SOUTHWESTERN ROWAN COUNTIES...
At 724 PM EDT, Rowan County Emergency Management reports new areas
of flooding are developing as floodwaves move downstream in the
tributaries feeding N Second Creek including, Sill Creek, Back
Creek, and Kerr Creek north of Atwell and east of Mount Ulla,
including Kerr Mill-Sloan Park.  Back Creek Church Rd is currently
underwater at Sills Creek.  Kerr Creek is currently causing
significant flooding of lowlands including residental yards at NC
150.
Other potential areas of flooding that may develop over the next 1-2
hours include around White Rd, Lyerly Rd, Upright Rd, Graham Rd,
Goodnight Rd, and Sherrills Ford Rd.  Drivers are urged to obey all
barricades and avoid flooded roadways.  Turn Around, Don`t Drown.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms producing
flash flooding.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Life threatening flash flooding of creeks and streams,
urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses.
Some locations that may continue to experience flash flooding
include...
Kannapolis, Salisbury, Statesville, Mooresville, Davidson, China
Grove, Landis, Enochville, Troutman, Cleveland, Lake Norman State
Park,  Mount Ulla, Piedmont Research Station and Doolie.
Areas of light rainfall are approaching Rowan and Iredell counties.
This rainfall is not expected to pose any threats.  However, new
rounds of heavy rainfall are possible tonight and this could
reinvigorate the flood threat given saturated soils and swollen
streams.  Another round of heavy rainfall is possible on Thursday.
Please stay weather aware and be prepared to take action should
heavy rain redevelop.
