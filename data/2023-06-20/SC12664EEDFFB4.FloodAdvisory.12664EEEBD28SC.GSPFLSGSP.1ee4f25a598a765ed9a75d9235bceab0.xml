<headline>Flood Advisory issued June 20 at 2:45PM EDT until June 20 at 7:30PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 845 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of upstate South Carolina, including the
following county, Anderson.
* WHEN...Until 845 PM EDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance to Minor flooding of low-lying areas adjacent
to streams and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland,
greenways, parks, boat-access areas, golf courses, low-water
crossings, underpasses, urbanized areas, and low-lying roadways
and parking lots.  High flows over low-water crossings and
low-lying roadways are possible and water may approach low-lying
structures.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 241 PM EDT, Over the past 1-2 hours, areas of torrential
rainfall have developed over central Anderson County,
including the city of Anderson.  This is on top of 2-3 inches
of rainfall which fell last night.  Therefore, soils are very
saturated and it will take little additional rainfall to
cause new stream rises and areas of nuisance to Minor
flooding, especially from Northlake to Sandy Springs to
Homeland Park to Anderson.
- Showers and thunderstorms will continue to develop through
the afternoon hours.  These showers will be very efficient at
producing heavy rainfall and soils are saturated.  Therefore,
additional heavy rain will quickly create new areas of
flooding and cause previous areas of flooding to redevelop.
Caution is advised near any stream or other vulnerable area.
Seek higher ground immediately when heavy rain develops.
Flash Flood Warnings may be issued during the day and into
the nighttime hours.  Please have a plan in place should
flash flooding develop and do not hesitate to act.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Anderson, Clemson, Homeland Park, Belton, Northlake,
Pendleton, Iva, Anderson Airport, and Sandy Springs.</description>
