<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued June 20 at 4:04PM EDT until June 20 at 10:00PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
Cabarrus County in the piedmont of North Carolina...
* Until 1000 PM EDT.
* At 404 PM EDT, Emergency management is reporting flooded roadways
near the Rowan-Cabarrus County line in Kannapolis.  1-2 inches of
rain quickly fell over the past 1-2 hours on top of 2-4 inches of
rainfall which occurred last night.  Saturated soils and high
stream flows are responding quickly to this additional excessive
runoff.
* Lake Kannapolis Dam is spilling significant flows into Irish
Buffalo Creek and these flows are likely to cause or are already
causing flooding of points downstream including C Street, Pump
Station Rd, Tiffany Drive, Pine Street, and Rainbow Drive.
* Exercise extreme caution when traveling in the Kannapolis area.
Avoid all flooded roadways and obey all barricades.  Stay away
from all streams, but especially Irish Buffalo Creek.  Significant
flows will sweep away cars and persons caught in the flood waters.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms
producing flash flooding.
SOURCE...Emergency management reported.
IMPACT...Life threatening flash flooding of creeks and streams,
urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses.  High
flow going over Kannapolis Dam will cause downstream
flooding along Irish Buffalo Creek, impacting roads,
low-lying areas, and possibly several low-lying
structures.
* Some locations that are experiencing flash flooding include...
Kannapolis, Downtown Concord, West Concord, Harrisburg,
Enochville, and Mt Pleasant.
