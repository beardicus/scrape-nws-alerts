<headline>Flood Advisory issued June 20 at 3:23PM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 915 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of piedmont North Carolina, including the
following county, Cabarrus.
* WHEN...Until 915 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance to Minor flooding of low-lying areas adjacent
to streams and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland,
greenways, parks, boat-access areas, golf courses, low-water
crossings, underpasses, urbanized areas, and low-lying roadways
and parking lots.  High flows over low-water crossings and
low-lying roadways are possible and water may approach low-lying
structures.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 319 PM EDT, Torrential showers and thunderstorms have
developed across Cabarrus County, exacerbating high flow
conditions along the Rocky River, Coddle Creek and Irish
Buffalo Creek.  Another 1-2 inches of rainfall has occurred
over the past 1-2 hours.  Heavy rainfall is moving out of
Cabarrus County but high flows and areas of flooding will
persist for the next several hours.
- Showers and thunderstorms will continue to develop through
the afternoon hours.  These showers will be very efficient at
producing heavy rainfall and soils are saturated.  Therefore,
additional heavy rain will quickly create new areas of
flooding and cause previous areas of flooding to redevelop.
Caution is advised near any stream or other vulnerable area.
Seek higher ground immediately when heavy rain develops.
Flash Flood Warnings may be issued during the day and into
the nighttime hours.  Please have a plan in place should
flash flooding develop and do not hesitate to act.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Kannapolis, Downtown Concord, West Concord, Harrisburg,
Enochville, Mt Pleasant, Charlotte Motor Speedway, Coddle
Creek Reservoir and Midland.</description>
<instruction>In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
