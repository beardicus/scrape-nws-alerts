<headline>Flood Advisory issued June 20 at 5:29PM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 730 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...A portion of western North Carolina, including the
following counties, Avery, Burke, McDowell, Mitchell and
Rutherford.
* WHEN...Until 730 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance to Minor flooding of low-lying areas adjacent
to streams and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland,
greenways, parks, boat-access areas, golf courses, low-water
crossings, and low-lying roadways.  High flows over low-water
crossings and low-lying roadways are possible and water may
approach low-lying structures.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 528 PM EDT, Doppler radar and rain gauges have reported
2-7 inches of rainfall since midnight along the northern Blue
Ridge Escarpment, adjacent foothills, and northern NC
mountains.  Areas of McDowell County from Lake Tahoma to
Pleasant Gardens to Marion to Woodlawn have received isolated
totals of 5-7 inches. Areas of earlier Minor flooding that
impacted several low-water crossings and secondary roads has
receded.  However, several streams remain elevated and are
rising once again due to recent moderate rainfall.
Additional nuisance to Minor flooding is possible across the
northern NC mountains, including and especially the
headwaters and tributaries of several streams including the
North Fork Catawba River, Linville River, upper Catawba
River, Buck Creek, Warrior Fork, and the North Toe River.
The Flood Advisory will remain in place until streams crest
and the flood threat has diminished.
- Showers and thunderstorms will continue to develop into the
evening and overnight hours.  These showers will be very
efficient at producing heavy rainfall and soils are
saturated.  Therefore, additional heavy rain will quickly
create new areas of flooding and cause previous areas of
flooding to redevelop. Caution is advised near any stream or
other vulnerable area.  Seek higher ground immediately when
heavy rain develops.  Flash Flood Warnings may be issued
tonight into tomorrow morning.  Please have a plan in place
should flash flooding develop and do not hesitate to act.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Morganton, Marion, Spruce Pine, Burnsville, Newland, Drexel,
Old Fort, Banner Elk, Elk Park, Bakersville, Beech Mountain
In Avery County, Crossnore, Sugar Mountain, Seven Devils,
Linville Falls, Lake James State Park.</description>
<instruction>In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
