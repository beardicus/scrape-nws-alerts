<headline>Flood Advisory issued June 20 at 3:31PM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 930 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Portions of piedmont North Carolina and western North
Carolina, including the following counties, in piedmont North
Carolina, Catawba. In western North Carolina, Burke, Caldwell and
McDowell.
* WHEN...Until 930 PM EDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance to Minor flooding of low-lying areas adjacent
to streams and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland,
greenways, parks, boat-access areas, golf courses, low-water
crossings, underpasses, urbanized areas, and low-lying roadways
and parking lots.  High flows over low-water crossings and
low-lying roadways are possible and water may approach low-lying
structures.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 328 PM EDT, Torrential showers and thunderstorms have been
training over the Catawba River Valley over the past 1-2
hours, producing rainfall accumulations of 1-2 inches in a
short period of time.  This rainfall is occurring over
saturated soils and will cause excessive runoff, resulting in
areas of nuisance to Minor flooding.
- Showers and thunderstorms will continue to develop through
the afternoon hours.  These showers will be very efficient at
producing heavy rainfall and soils are saturated.  Therefore,
additional heavy rain will quickly create new areas of
flooding and cause previous areas of flooding to redevelop.
Caution is advised near any stream or other vulnerable area.
Seek higher ground immediately when heavy rain develops.
Flash Flood Warnings may be issued during the day and into
the nighttime hours.  Please have a plan in place should
flash flooding develop and do not hesitate to act.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Hickory, Lenoir, Morganton, Newton, Marion, St. Stephens,
Conover, Longview, Sawmills, Granite Falls, Valdese,
Bethlehem, Maiden, Hudson, Salem, Icard, Cajah`s Mountain,
Drexel, Hildebran and Connelly Springs.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.</instruction>
