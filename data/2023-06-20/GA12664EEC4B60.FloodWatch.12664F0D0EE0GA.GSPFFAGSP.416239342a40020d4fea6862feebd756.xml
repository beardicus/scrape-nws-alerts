<headline>Flood Watch issued June 20 at 3:28AM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of northeast Georgia, western North Carolina and
Upstate South Carolina, including the following areas, in
northeast Georgia, Franklin, Habersham, Hart, Rabun and Stephens
Counties. In western North Carolina, Macon, Southern Jackson and
Transylvania Counties. In Upstate South Carolina, Anderson,
Greenville, Cherokee, Oconee, Pickens, and Spartanburg Counties.
* WHEN...Through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A low pressure system persisting near the southern
Appalachians will keep deep moisture in place over the
region. Numerous rounds of showers and thunderstorms will
develop over the area today, tomorrow, and likely into
Thursday, bringing periods of very heavy rainfall. An
additional 3 to 6 inches of rain will be possible over the
southern North Carolina mountains, Upstate South Carolina,
and northeast Georgia through Thursday, falling on areas that
have already received several inches of rain over the past 24
hours. This will make ongoing flooding worsen and likely
cause new flash flooding to develop.

<instruction>A Flood Watch for flash flooding means there is a potential for
rapid onset flooding based on current forecasts. Flash flooding is a
very dangerous situation and may impact areas that do not typically
flood. Please monitor the latest forecasts and be prepared to take
action quickly should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.
Rainfall of more than five inches in similar storms has been
associated with an increased risk of landslides and rockslides. If
you live on a mountainside or in a cove at the base of a mountain,
especially near a stream, be ready to leave in advance of the storm
or as quickly as possible should rising water, moving earth, or
rocks threaten. Consider postponing travel along mountain roads
during periods of heavy rainfall.
Low-lying areas adjacent to streams, including campgrounds, are
especially vulnerable to flooding. If you live or are vacationing
next to a stream, please have a plan in place to seek higher ground
once heavy rainfall develops. Flash floods can occur quickly and
overwhelm adjacent low-lying areas with little warning. Once the
stream starts to rise, you may only have minutes to evacuate. Flash
floods can cause catastrophic damage and be powerful enough to sweep
away campers, vehicles, and mobile homes. Consider temporarily
relocating away from streams until the heavy rainfall threat passes.</instruction>
