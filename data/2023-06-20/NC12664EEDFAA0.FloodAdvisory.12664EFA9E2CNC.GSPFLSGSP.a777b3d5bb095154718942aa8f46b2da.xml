<headline>Flood Advisory issued June 20 at 2:32PM EDT until June 20 at 9:15PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 830 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of piedmont North Carolina, including the
following county, Rowan.
* WHEN...Until 830 PM EDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance to Minor flooding of low-lying areas adjacent
to streams and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland,
greenways, parks, boat-access areas, golf courses, low-water
crossings, and low-lying roadways.  High flows over low-water
crossings and low-lying roadways are possible and water may
approach low-lying structures.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 225 PM EDT, New rounds of heavy rain have developed over
southwestern Rowan County, which received 2-4 inches of
rainfall last night from thunderstorms.  Therefore, soils are
very saturated and it will take little additional rainfall to
cause new stream rises and areas of nuisance to Minor
flooding, especially from China Grove to Enochville, Atwell,
and Mount Ulla.  The headwaters of N Second Creek, Coddle
Creek, and Irish Buffalo Creek are especially vulnerable in
this area for new areas of flooding.
- Showers and thunderstorms will continue to develop through
the afternoon hours.  These showers will be very efficient at
producing heavy rainfall and soils are saturated.  Therefore,
additional heavy rain will quickly create new areas of
flooding and cause previous areas of flooding to redevelop.
Caution is advised near any stream or other vulnerable area.
Seek higher ground immediately when heavy rain develops.
Flash Flood Warnings may be issued during the day and into
the nighttime hours.  Please have a plan in place should
flash flooding develop and do not hesitate to act.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Kannapolis, China Grove, Landis, Enochville, Cleveland,
Piedmont Research Station and Mount Ulla.</description>
