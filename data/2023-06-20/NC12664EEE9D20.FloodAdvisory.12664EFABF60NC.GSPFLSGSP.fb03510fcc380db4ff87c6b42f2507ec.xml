<headline>Flood Advisory issued June 20 at 6:48PM EDT until June 20 at 10:00PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EDT TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...A portion of western North Carolina, including the
following county, Caldwell.
* WHEN...Until midnight EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance to Minor flooding of low-lying areas adjacent
to streams and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland,
greenways, parks, boat-access areas, low-water crossings,
low-lying roadways, and hiking trails adjacent to streams.  High
flows over low-water crossings and low-lying roadways are possible
and water may approach low-lying structures.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 641 PM EDT, Multiple rounds of showers and thunderstorms
have produced 3-6 inches of rainfall since last night across
central and western Caldwell County.  Streams are elevated
and soils are saturated, causing nuisance to Minor flooding
of low-lying areas.  Heavy rainfall has ended and only light
showers are impacting the Advisory area.  However, area
streams, including Wilson Creek, Johns River, Yadkin River,
and Mulberry Creek, remain elevated and have not yet crested.
Therefore, the Flood Advisory will remain in effect to allow
streams to crest and begin to recede.
- Showers and thunderstorms may continue to develop into the
evening and overnight hours.  These showers may be very
efficient at producing heavy rainfall and soils are
saturated.  Therefore, additional heavy rain will quickly
create new areas of flooding and cause previous areas of
flooding to redevelop. Caution is advised near any stream or
other vulnerable area.  Seek higher ground immediately when
heavy rain develops.  Flash Flood Warnings may be issued
tonight into tomorrow morning.  Please have a plan in place
should flash flooding develop and do not hesitate to act.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Lenoir, Gamewell, Hudson, Cajah`s Mountain, Blowing Rock In
Caldwell County, Cedar Rock, Lake Rhodhiss, Grandfather
Mountain State Park, B.R. Parkway-Linville Falls To
Grandfather, Patterson, Collettsville, Upton, Globe, Edgemont
and Kings Creek.</description>
<instruction>In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
