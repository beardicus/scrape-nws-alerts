<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT...
...UPDATED FOR THE MIDNIGHT FIRE...
The following message is transmitted at the request of the New Mexico
Departments of Health and Environment, United States Forest Service
and the Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality Response Program.
* WHAT...The new and fast growing Midnight Wildfire in eastern Colfax
County, between El Rito and Vallecitos, will produce significant
near surface smoke tonight and move toward the southeast. Transport
winds aloft will be light northwest to southeast tonight and light
west to east Saturday.
* WHERE...Smoke impacts from the Midnight Fire will be greatest in
eastern and southeastern Rio Arriba County, southern Taos County,
western Mora County, northwest San Miguel County, northern and
central Santa Fe County and Los Alamos County. This includes but
is not limited to the following locations: El Rito, Ojo Caliente,
Embudo, Penasco, Taos, Tres Ritos, Truchas, Cowles, Chupadero,
Santa Fe and Los Alamos.
* WHEN...This evening through at least 1 PM MDT Saturday June 10.
More details and latest air quality information can be found at
https://fire.airnow.gov.
* IMPACTS...Those with conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and heart
disease will be especially vulnerable to impacts from poor air
quality, as will adults over age 65, young children, and pregnant
women if smoke concentrations become unhealthy.
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method available
at https://nmtracking.doh.nm.gov/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
https://nmtracking.doh.nm.gov/environment/air/IndoorQuality.html and
https://cv.nmhealth.org
New Mexicans will also need to take steps to keep their homes cool to
avoid heat-related illnesses. NMDOH offers tips here:
