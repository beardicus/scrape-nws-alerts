<description>...Snow In The Brooks Range Through Tonight...
Up to 3 inches of snow is expected in the Central and Eastern
Brooks Range through tonight. Snow will melt soon after falling in
most areas below 2000 feet, but snow may accumulate in areas
above 2000 ft. This includes the Dalton Highway near Atigun Pass,
and the village of Anaktuvuk Pass. Snow is expected to taper off
during the day Saturday. Motorists and hikers venturing into the
Brooks Range above 2000 feet should prepare for snow today and
tonight.
A cold front pushing south over the Brooks Range is bringing the
snow and cold temperatures, along with north winds gusting to 25
mph. Temperatures in the Central and Eastern Brooks Range will
remain in the lower 30s today and fall into the 20s tonight.
Motorists and hikers venturing into the Brooks Range above 2000
feet should prepare for snow today and tonight.</description>
