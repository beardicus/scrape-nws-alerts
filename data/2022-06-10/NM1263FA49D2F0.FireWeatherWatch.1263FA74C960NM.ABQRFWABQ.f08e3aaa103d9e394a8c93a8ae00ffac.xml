.An upper level trough will approach from the west by Sunday and
allow southwest winds to increase across parts of northern New
Mexico. The combination of strong winds with very low humidity,
near-record hot temperatures, and an unstable airmass will
generate critical fire weather conditions. Winds will continue to
strengthen across the area on Monday, and with continued very dry
conditions, critical fire weather conditions will become more
widespread across northern and eastern New Mexico.
