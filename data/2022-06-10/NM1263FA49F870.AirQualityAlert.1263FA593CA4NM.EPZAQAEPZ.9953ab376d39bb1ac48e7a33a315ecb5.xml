<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM MDT SATURDAY...
The New Mexico Departments of Health and Environment has issued an
Air Quality Alert, until 1 PM MDT Saturday.
An Air Quality Alert for Smoke has been issued.
* WHAT... Smoke from new fires in western areas of the state and the
two largest fires will tend to drift toward the southeast through
the remainder of the afternoon and evening. Transport winds from
the northwest around 10 mph or less for most areas along and west
of the central mountain chain will gradually shift more westerly on
Saturday but remain light. Light and more variable wind conditions
expected in the vicinity of the Black fire. Significant impacts
from new and residual smoke will be localized and in close
proximity to individual fires through Saturday morning. New fires
caused by recent lightning activity may also contribute additional
smoke to regional airsheds going into Saturday as hot and dry
conditions dominate.
* WHERE... Significant smoke impacts will be localized across
portions of northern Grant and western Sierra counties. Elsewhere,
brief moderate impacts are expected at times between the Rio Grande
Valley and Continental Divide but widespread unhealthy conditions
are not expected. More details and latest air quality information
can be found at https://fire.airnow.gov
* WHEN... Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1pm MDT
Saturday, June 11th.</description>
