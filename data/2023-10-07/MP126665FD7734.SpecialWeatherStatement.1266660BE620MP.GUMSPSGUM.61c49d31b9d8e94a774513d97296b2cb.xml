<description>...AN APPROACHING TROPICAL CYCLONE WILL BRING STRONG WINDS,
HEAVY RAINFALL, AND HAZARDOUS SEAS AND SURF TO THE MARIANAS
NEXT WEEK...
A strengthening tropical cyclone, currently Tropical Depression
15W, will approach and likely pass through the Marianas Tuesday
and Wednesday. TD 15W is forecast to become a tropical storm by
Sunday, with further strengthening expected.
This is a developing situation, but the forecast &quot;cone&quot; is
starting to narrow and a passage through or very near the Mariana
Islands expected, with a passage near or over Guam or Rota being
favored Tuesday into Wednesday. As of now, tropical storm force
winds for most or all of the islands is forecast, with low-end
typhoon winds possible close to the eye of the storm passage.
Forecast track and storm wind intensity will continue to be
narrowed down and fine-tuned as the storm approaches.
What is of more certainty is that heavy rainfall and hazardous
seas and surf will accompany this system. Current estimates are
for 6 to 10 inches of rain to fall between Monday night and
Wednesday afternoon, with locally higher amounts near 12 inches
possible. Hazardous seas and and surf look likely to begin Monday
night, with highs seas and high surf expected Tuesday and
Wednesday.</description>
