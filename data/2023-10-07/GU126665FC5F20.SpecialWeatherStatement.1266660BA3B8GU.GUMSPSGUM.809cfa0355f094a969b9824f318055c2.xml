<description>...AN APPROACHING TROPICAL SYSTEM WILL BRING STRONG WINDS AND
HEAVY RAINFALL TO THE MARIANAS NEXT WEEK...
A developing tropical disturbance, known as Invest 98W from the
Joint Typhoon Warning Center will approach and likely pass through
the Marianas Tuesday night or Wednesday (as it stands right now).
This is a developing situation, but the forecast &quot;cone&quot; is
starting to narrow, with a potential passage between very near or
through the Mariana Islands. IT`S IMPORTANT TO NOTE, forecast
variability continues and later forecasts will likely change.
What`s important to note is the trends in the data over the last
24 to 36 hours there have been an upward trend in projected
strength, indicating potentially higher sustained winds speeds
have been observed. That said, it`s still to early to specify what
wind speeds will it be as it passes through the region.
What is of more certainty is heavy rainfall and higher seas will
accompany this feature. Current estimates are for 6 to 10 inches
of rain will fall between Monday afternoon and Wednesday
afternoon, with locally higher amounts near 12 inches possible.
Seas will also build into the 14 to 18 foot range, possibly
higher.</description>
