<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS
EVENING...

dangerous rip currents through Saturday.
* WHERE...Santa Barbara County Southwestern Coast and Santa
Barbara County Southeastern Coast.

nearshore.

beaches. Nuisance tidal overflow is possible in beach parking
lots and walkways around the high tide early this afternoon.</description>

locations in such conditions, so stay off the rocks.</instruction>
