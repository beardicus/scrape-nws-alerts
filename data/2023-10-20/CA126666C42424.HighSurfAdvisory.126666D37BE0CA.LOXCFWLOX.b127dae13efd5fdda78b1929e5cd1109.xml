<headline>High Surf Advisory issued October 20 at 2:45AM PDT until October 21 at 3:00AM PDT by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 AM PDT SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Large breaking waves 6 to 9 feet with local sets to 10
feet are expected today and early tonight. Surf is forecast to
subside slowly tonight, lowering to 4 to 6 feet with local sets
to 7 feet by late tonight. However, elevated surf will continue
through Saturday. There will be a high risk of dangerous rip
currents through Saturday.
* WHERE...Ventura County Beaches.
* WHEN...Until 3 AM PDT Saturday.
* IMPACTS...There is an increased risk for ocean drowning. Rip
currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Large
breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and
rocks, and capsize small boats near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Surf will be highest on west and northwest
facing beaches. Nuisance to locally minor coastal flooding is
possible around the high tide early this afternoon. This concern
is mainly for low-lying coastal areas such as beach parking lots
and harbor walkways.</description>
<instruction>Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly
locations in such conditions, so stay off the rocks.</instruction>
