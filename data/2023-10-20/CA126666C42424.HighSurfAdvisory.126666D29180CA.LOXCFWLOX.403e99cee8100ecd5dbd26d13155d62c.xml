<headline>High Surf Advisory issued October 20 at 2:45AM PDT until October 20 at 9:00PM PDT by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM PDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Large breaking waves of 10 to 15 feet with local sets to
20 feet are expected on west and northwest facing beaches today.
Surf will be highest through early this afternoon, then is
forecast to subside to 6 to 9 feet this evening. However,
elevated surf will continue through Saturday. There will be a
high risk of dangerous rip currents through Saturday.
* WHERE...San Luis Obispo County Beaches and Santa Barbara
County Central Coast Beaches.
* WHEN...Until 9 PM PDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...There is an increased risk for ocean drowning. Rip
currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Large
breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and
rocks, and capsize small boats near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Surf will be highest on west and northwest
facing beaches. Nuisance to locally minor coastal flooding is
possible around the high tide early this afternoon. This concern
is mainly for low-lying coastal areas such as beach parking lots
and harbor walkways.</description>
<instruction>Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly
locations in such conditions, so stay off the rocks.</instruction>
