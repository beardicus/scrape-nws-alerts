<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued January 20 at 6:59PM PST until January 21 at 4:00PM PST by NWS Eureka</headline>
<description>...Long Period Swell Moving in tonight and Saturday...
The swell will be near 8 feet at 18 seconds by early Saturday
morning. Steep beaches will have a higher risk of sneaker wave
activity with greater wave run-up onto beaches. Large waves will
also wash over jetties and rock outcroppings that may normally
stay dry.
Very high tides and large tidal swings are expected. This may
cause localized coastal flooding around Humboldt Bay.
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY
AFTERNOON...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM TO NOON PST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, High astronomical tides
will cause minor flooding in low lying areas along the Humboldt
Coast. Up to one half foot of saltwater inundation above ground
level is possible in low lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways (Between 8.8 and 8.9 feet MLLW at the North Spit tide
gauge). For the Beach Hazards Statement, large unexpected waves
along the coast.
* WHERE...Northern Humboldt Coast County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 10 AM to noon PST
Saturday. For the Beach Hazards Statement, through Saturday
afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Large, unexpected waves can
sweep across the beach without warning, sweeping people into
the sea from rocks, jetties, and beaches. These waves can also
move large objects such as logs, crushing anyone caught
underneath.</description>
<instruction>A Coastal Flood Advisory indicates that onshore winds and tides
will combine to generate flooding of low areas along the shore.
Feet Above Ground is locally defined as feet above the Highest
Astronomical Tide or HAT.
Don`t be fooled by an ocean that looks calm. There can be
30 minutes of small waves before a sneaker wave strikes. Avoid
rocks and jetties. Avoid steep beaches. Stay much farther back
from the water and never turn your back on the ocean.</instruction>
