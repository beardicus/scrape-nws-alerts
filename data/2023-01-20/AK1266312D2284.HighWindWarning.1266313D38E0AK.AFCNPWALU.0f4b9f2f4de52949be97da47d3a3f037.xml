<headline>High Wind Warning issued January 20 at 3:57PM AKST until January 21 at 9:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM TO 9 PM AKST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...East winds 50 to 60 mph with gusts up to 75 mph.
* WHERE...Eastern Aleutians.
* WHEN...From 2 PM to 9 PM AKST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...High winds may move loose debris, damage property,
and cause power outages. Travel will be difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Easterly winds will steadily increase
tonight through Saturday morning, then peak mid afternoon
through early evening. This does not look like a prolonged
period of 75 mph gusts. Most of the winds will remain in the 55
to 65 mph range with just an occasional gust to 75 mph. Winds
will diminish late Saturday night into Sunday morning as the
front weakens. Precipitation will start as snow in the mid to
late afternoon hours on Saturday before changing to all rain
during the evening. The strong winds combined with falling snow
could initially lead to a period of low visibilities.</description>
<instruction>People are urged to secure loose objects that could be blown
around or damaged by the wind. Prepare for the possibility of
widespread power outages. Use caution if you must drive.</instruction>
