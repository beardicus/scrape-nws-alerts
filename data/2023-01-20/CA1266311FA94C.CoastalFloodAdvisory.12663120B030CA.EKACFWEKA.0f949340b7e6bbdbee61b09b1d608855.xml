<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued January 20 at 4:27AM PST until January 20 at 11:00AM PST by NWS Eureka</headline>
<description>...Long Period Swell Moving in Friday Evening
Long period forerunners will start filling in Friday afternoon.
The wave size will be sufficient for sneaker waves by Friday
evening. The swell will be near 8 feet at 18 seconds by early
Saturday morning. Steep beaches will have a higher risk of
sneaker wave activity with greater wave run- up onto beaches.
Large waves will also wash over jetties and rock outcroppings
that may normally stay dry.
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM TO 11 AM PST THIS
MORNING...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THIS EVENING
THROUGH SATURDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...High astronomical tides will cause minor flooding in low
lying areas. Up to one half foot of saltwater inundation above
ground level is possible in low lying areas near shorelines and
tidal waterways (up to 9.0 feet MLLW at the North Spit tide
gauge).
* WHERE...Northern Humboldt County coast, mainly around Humboldt
Bay, including Jackson Ranch Road and King Salmon.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 9 AM to 11 AM PST
this morning.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only isolated
road closures expected.</description>
<instruction>A Coastal Flood Advisory indicates that onshore winds and tides
will combine to generate flooding of low areas along the shore.
Feet Above Ground is locally defined as feet above the Highest
Astronomical Tide or HAT.
Don`t be fooled by an ocean that looks calm. There can be
30 minutes of small waves before a sneaker wave strikes. Avoid
rocks and jetties. Avoid steep beaches. Stay much farther back
from the water and never turn your back on the ocean.</instruction>
