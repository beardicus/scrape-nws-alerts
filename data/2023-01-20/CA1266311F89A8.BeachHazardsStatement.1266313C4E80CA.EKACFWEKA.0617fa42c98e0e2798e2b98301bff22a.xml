<description>...Long Period Swell Moving in Friday Evening
Long period forerunners will start filling in Friday afternoon.
The wave size will be sufficient for sneaker waves by Friday
evening. The swell will be near 8 feet at 18 seconds by early
Saturday morning. Steep beaches will have a higher risk of sneaker
wave activity with greater wave run- up onto beaches. Large waves
will also wash over jetties and rock outcroppings that may
normally stay dry.
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM THIS EVENING THROUGH
SATURDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Increased risk for sneaker waves. There may be periods
of lulls in wave activity for up to 30 minutes before larger
sets of waves return.
* WHERE...Coastal Del Norte, Northern Humboldt Coast,
Southwestern Humboldt and Mendocino Coast Counties.
* WHEN...From this evening through Saturday afternoon.. .
* IMPACTS...Large, unexpected waves can sweep across the beach
without warning, sweeping people into the sea from rocks,
jetties, and beaches. These waves can also move large objects
such as logs, crushing anyone caught underneath.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Sneaker waves occur when a larger set of
waves occurs after 20 to 30 minutes of smaller waves.</description>
<instruction>Don`t be fooled by an ocean that looks calm. There can be
30 minutes of small waves before a sneaker wave strikes. Avoid
rocks and jetties. Avoid steep beaches. Stay much farther back
from the water and never turn your back on the ocean.</instruction>
