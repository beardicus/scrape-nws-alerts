<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued October 01 at 3:35AM EDT until October 02 at 4:00AM EDT by NWS Melbourne</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM EDT SUNDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE TONIGHT...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding.
For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Coastal Volusia, Mainland Northern Brevard and
Northern Brevard Barrier Islands Counties.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 4 AM EDT Sunday.
For the High Rip Current Risk, through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Some flooding of low-lying lots, parks and roadways
may occur near the shoreline. Only isolated road closures are
expected. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>Coastal flooding is occurring. Coastal residents should be alert
for rising water. Do not drive around barricades or through water
of unknown depth.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as jetties and
piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If caught in a rip current, relax and float. Don`t swim against
the current. If able, swim in a direction following the shoreline.
If unable to escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
