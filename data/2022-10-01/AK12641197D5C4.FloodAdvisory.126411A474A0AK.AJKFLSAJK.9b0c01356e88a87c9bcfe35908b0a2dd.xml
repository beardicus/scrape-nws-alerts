<headline>Flood Advisory issued October 01 at 11:29AM AKDT  by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM AKDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...The following area, Northern Inner Channels.
* WHEN...Until 100 AM AKDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
Water over roadways. River or stream flows are elevated.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1125 AM AKDT, satellite estimates and rain gauge data
indicate heavy rain across the advisory area. Minor flooding
is ongoing or expected to begin shortly, especially near the
Chilkat and Klehini Rivers along with Porcupine Creek. The
heaviest rainfall is over and scattered showers will continue
into the afternoon.
- Areas around mile post 14 and 24 of the Haines Highway and
around Porcupine Creek is the most likely place to experience
minor flooding.
- For Chilkat River at Klukwan:
At 10:00am the stage was 126.71 feet.
Flood Stage is 128.0 feet.
Forecast: A crest around 127.92 feet is expected around
10:00pm Saturday.
Impacts:
At 127.0 feet: This is bankfull stage, but water can encroach
the Haines Highway, south of Klukwan.  Note that the Chilkat
River is highly braided, if and when it shifts channels, our
present bankfull and flood stages will be outdated.
At 128.0 feet: Water will begin to flow over the driveway
into the property of Chilkat River Adventures just upstream
of the Chilkat River bridge. Additionally minor flooding may
occur near 14 mile and 25 mile boat launches along with minor
flooding of Porcupine Road.
At 128.5 feet: Water will flood the property of Chilkat River
Adventures just upstream of the Chilkat River bridge with
some other minor flooding near 14 mile and 25 mile boat
launches and along Porcupine Road.
- If you live or recreate along Chilkat River or Porcupine Creek
stay alert and be prepared to take action.</description>
