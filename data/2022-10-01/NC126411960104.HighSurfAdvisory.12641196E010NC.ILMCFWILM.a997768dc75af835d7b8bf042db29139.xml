<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
