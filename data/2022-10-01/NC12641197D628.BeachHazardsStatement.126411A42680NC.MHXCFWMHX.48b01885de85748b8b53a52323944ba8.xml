<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY MORNING THROUGH
TUESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Watch, 2 to 4 feet of inundation
above ground level possible in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways. For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous
rip currents and large breaking waves in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Northern Outer Banks.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Watch, from Monday morning
through Tuesday evening. For the Beach Hazards Statement,
until 8 PM EDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Up to 2 to 4 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in some areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in an elevated threat of property damage. Flooding
will extend inland from the waterfront threatening some homes
and businesses. Numerous road closures and flooding of vehicles
will be possible. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers
away from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore break can
throw a swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom causing
neck and back injuries.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most likely time for strong rip
currents to occur is a couple hours either side of low tide,
which will occur around 6:30 PM this evening.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
