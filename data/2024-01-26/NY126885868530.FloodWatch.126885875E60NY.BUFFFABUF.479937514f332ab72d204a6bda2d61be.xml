<senderName>NWS Buffalo (Western New York)</senderName>
<headline>Flood Watch issued January 26 at 3:44AM EST  by NWS Buffalo</headline>
<description>.Ongoing steady rain will taper off by mid to late morning. This
round of rain will bring rainfall amounts of up to a half inch.
Snowmelt and runoff will increase this morning, bringing elevated
flows to area creeks
and rivers.
Field reports from Thursday indicated ice formation on the Buffalo
area
creeks, as well as creeks and rivers in the western Southern Tier.
As creeks and rivers rise, a continued mild airmass will continue to
encourage the creek and river ice to break, leading to possible ice
jams and subsequent flooding. The ice is not particularly thick,
which will likely limit the potential for ice jam flooding.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt, and also ice jams
will continue to be possible.
* WHERE...A portion of western New York, including the following
counties, Chautauqua, Northern Erie and Southern Erie.
* WHEN...Through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in minor flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
There is a limited risk of ice jams as well on the Buffalo area
creeks and other creeks across the western Southern Tier, with a
chance of minor flooding associated with ice jams.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The combination of snowmelt and rainfall runoff, combined
with the breakup of creek ice, may bring a limited potential
for minor flooding and minor ice jam flooding in low lying,
flood prone areas.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
