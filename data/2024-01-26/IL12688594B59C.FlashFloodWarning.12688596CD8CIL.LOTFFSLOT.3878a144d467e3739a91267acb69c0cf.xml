<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING FOR AN ICE JAM REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 915 AM
CST SATURDAY FOR EAST CENTRAL GRUNDY AND SOUTHWESTERN WILL
COUNTIES...
At 743 PM CST, At 730 PM CST, emergency management and river gauge
data indicated re-newed ice jamming near the I-55 bridge, which has
caused river levels to quickly rise to 15.5 ft to the east of I-55.
Shifting of the ice jam and subsequent rapid break up are are
imminent, which will result in potentially life threatening flash
flooding downstream of I-55.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding from an ice jam.
SOURCE...Emergency management.
IMPACT...Life-threatening flash flooding of areas near and
downstream of the ice jam.
Flash flooding will occur from near the Interstate 55 bridge to the
confluence with the Illinois River.
Sudden shifting of this ice jam as it moves down river may cause
rapid rises of water and flooding of property along the banks. Water
is expected to rise up to 3-5 feet and will move downstream toward
the mouth of the Kankakee River, which may flood roadways and
structures along the banks. Flowing ice may damage roadways and
structures along the immediate banks of the river.
FLASH FLOOD...OBSERVED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>A Flash Flood Warning means rapid-onset flooding is imminent.
Persons along the lower Kankakee River should take immediate
precautions to protect life and property.</instruction>
