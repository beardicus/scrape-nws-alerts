<headline>Flood Warning issued January 26 at 11:18AM CST until January 29 at 12:00PM CST by NWS Chicago</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Chicago IL has issued a Flood
Warning for the following rivers in Illinois...
Kankakee River at Momence affecting Kankakee County.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM THIS MORNING TO EARLY MONDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by a combination of snowmelt and heavy
river ice.
* WHERE...Kankakee River from the IL/IN state line downstream to
confluence with Iroquois River at Aroma Park, including the
Momence gauge.
* WHEN...From this morning to early Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of roadways, yards, agricultural land, wetlands
along the river.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 10:45 AM CST Friday the stage was 4.4 feet. Kankakee
County Emergency Management indicated shifting ice and
multiple ice jams occurring along the Kankakee River from
near Kankakee upstream to near Sun River Terrace. Water
levels are rising in multiple areas upstream of ice jams.
- Forecast...Shifting and breaking of river ice may cause new
ice jams and flooding. Ice jams upstream of the area are
breaking up, which could cause additional ice to accumulate
in the area.
- Flood stage is 5.0 feet.

&amp;&amp;</description>
<instruction>A Flood Warning means water levels above flood stage are imminent or
may already be occurring. Persons along rivers and streams in the
warned area should take immediate precautions to protect life and
property.
An ice jam is affecting water levels in this area. River forecasts
during ice jams are less certain due to many complicated factors.
Significant river ice cover can cause large water level fluctuations
and flooding with little advanced notice. River ice may also cause
gauge observations to be inaccurate.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
The next statement will be issued late tonight at 530 AM CST.</instruction>
