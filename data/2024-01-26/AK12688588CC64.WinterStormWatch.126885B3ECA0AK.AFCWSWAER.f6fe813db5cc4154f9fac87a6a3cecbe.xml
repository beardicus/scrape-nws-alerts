<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 26 at 2:37PM AKST until January 28 at 9:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH NOW IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY EVENING THROUGH
SUNDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 6 to 12
inches possible from Glennallen to Paxson. Total snow
accumulation of 12 to 24 inches possible for the southern Copper
River Basin, including Chitina to McCarthy.
* WHERE...Copper River Basin.
* WHEN...From Saturday evening through Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A series of storms will track from the Gulf
of Alaska north into Southcentral. The first storm for tonight
into Saturday is tracking farther east, which will lead to
lighter snow across the Copper River Basin. Thus, the threat for
heavy snow has been pushed back to Saturday evening as the
second storm arrives. There is still quite a bit of uncertainty
with the track of this storm, but it currently favors the
southern Copper River Basin for the heaviest snow, with
somewhat lighter accumulation from Glennallen northward to
Paxson. Additional storm systems and potential for more snow
will follow through early next week.</description>
