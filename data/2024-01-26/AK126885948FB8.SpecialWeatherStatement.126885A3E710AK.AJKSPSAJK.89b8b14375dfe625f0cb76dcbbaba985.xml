<description>...LONG DURATION HEAVY RAIN AND RISING FREEZING LEVELS THROUGH
MONDAY...
A warm front will cause precipitation to track into the region
from south to north on Friday. A wind shift out of the south with
increased speeds will allow warming temperatures through the inner
channels Friday. Meanwhile, snow/freezing levels will steadily
rise. Freezing levels over Hoonah and Gustavus will likely rise to
around 3,000 feet Friday night, then during Sunday, these values
top out at over 4,000 feet.
Rainfall totals over this 4 day period will vary as two or more
surges of moisture move through, but are likely to reach 0.5-1
inch on Friday and again Saturday, then 1-1.5 inches Sunday and
Monday.
Rain on significant snowpack currently in place can result in
several impacts:
* Snow will become heavier as it absorbs the rain, making it
more difficult to move.
* Heavier snow may affect susceptible properties and vessels.
* Drainage blocked by snow will cause rainfall runoff and snowmelt
onto streets and ponding.
* Rain on hard-pack snow will become icy.
* Snowmelt from high elevation snow will add to runoff.
Please consider your personal property and neighborhood drainage
before the onset of heavy rain. Stay tuned to updates from the
National Weather Service on this developing pattern change.</description>
