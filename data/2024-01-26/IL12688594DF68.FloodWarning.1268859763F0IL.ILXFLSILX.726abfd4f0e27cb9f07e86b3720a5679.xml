<headline>Flood Warning issued January 26 at 8:50PM CST until further notice by NWS Central Illinois</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in
Illinois...
Sangamon River near Chandlerville affecting Cass and Mason
Counties.
.An ice jam will cause water to infiltrate the lowlands along the
river.
.The following forecasts are based on observed precipitation, soil
moisture conditions, and forecast precipitation. The ice jam
upstream of Chandlerville has been reported to be on the move, as
indicated by the recent drop in stage at Oakford. The stage at
Chandlerville is rising quickly as upstream water and ice quickly
move through. Stages have already been elevated due to some ice or
debris conditions downstream of Chandlerville. The rise in stage can
be considerable if the dislodged ice causes a new or enhanced jam at
Chandlerville or downstream. Fluctuations of 1-3 ft are likely.
