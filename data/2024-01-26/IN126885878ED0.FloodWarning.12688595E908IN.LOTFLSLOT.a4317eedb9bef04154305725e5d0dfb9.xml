&amp;&amp;</description>
<instruction>River rises are being affected by snow melt from a combination of
observed precipitation and warm temperatures.
An ice jam is affecting water levels in this area. River forecasts
during ice jams are less certain due to many complicated factors.
Significant river ice cover can cause large water level fluctuations
and flooding with little advanced notice.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
The next statement will be issued late tonight at 330 AM CST.</instruction>
