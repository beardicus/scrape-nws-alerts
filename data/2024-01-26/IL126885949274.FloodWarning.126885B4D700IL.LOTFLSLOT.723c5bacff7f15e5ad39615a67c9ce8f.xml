<instruction>River rises are being affected by snow melt from a combination of
precipitation and warm temperatures. Changes to the precipitation
forecast or the temperature forecast may cause changes to the river
forecast.
An ice jam is affecting water levels in this area. River forecasts
during ice jams are less certain due to many complicated factors.
Significant river ice cover can cause large water level fluctuations
and flooding with little advanced notice. River ice may also cause
gauge observations to be inaccurate.
These forecasts are based on observed precipitation as well as
forecast precipitation 48 hours into the future. Changes to the
rainfall forecast, or any additional rainfall after 48 hours, may
cause changes to these river forecasts.
A Flood Warning means water levels above flood stage are imminent or
may already be occurring. Persons along rivers and streams in the
warned area should take immediate precautions to protect life and
property.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
The next statement will be issued Saturday afternoon at 100 PM CST.</instruction>
