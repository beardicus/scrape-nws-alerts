<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 26 at 2:37PM AKST until January 28 at 9:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH NOW IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY EVENING THROUGH
SUNDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Blowing snow possible for Thompson
Pass. Total snow accumulations of 12 to 24 inches possible.
* WHERE...Northeast Prince William Sound.
* WHEN...From Saturday evening through Sunday evening.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A series of storms will track from the Gulf
of Alaska north into Southcentral. The first storm will pass
well to the east of the area tonight. Thus, the threat for heavy
snow has been pushed back to Saturday evening as the second
storm arrives. This storm still has potential to bring a period
of heavy snow, though there is a high level of uncertainty in
the track of this storm. Snow accumulation could end up being
much lighter than the amounts above. Additional storm systems
and potential for more snow will follow through early next week.</description>
