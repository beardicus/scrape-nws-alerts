<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 26 at 2:37PM AKST until January 28 at 6:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH NOW IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH SUNDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of up to 12
inches possible.
* WHERE...Southeast Prince William Sound.
* WHEN...From Saturday afternoon through Sunday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A series of storms will track from the Gulf
of Alaska north into Southcentral. The first storm will pass
well to the east of the area tonight. Thus, the threat for heavy
snow has been pushed back to Saturday evening as the second
storm arrives. This storm still has potential to bring a period
of heavy snow, though there is a high level of uncertainty in
the track of this storm. There is also potential for rain to
mix in with the snow Sunday afternoon. Thus, snow accumulation
could end up being much lighter than the amounts above.
Additional storm systems and potential for more snow will follow
through early next week.</description>
