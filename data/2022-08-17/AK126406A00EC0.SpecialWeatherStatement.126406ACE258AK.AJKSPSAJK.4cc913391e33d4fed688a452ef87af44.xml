<description>...RIVER LEVELS ON THE RISE...
The atmospheric river moving through the area this morning has
caused rivers to rise from 0.5 to 2 inches of rainfall. Heavy rain
will move back into the area through the late morning and persist
through the afternoon. Additional rain amounts will be from 1 to 2
inches. This will produce more rapid rise on streams and river but
at this time it is expected for them to remain within their banks.
Some daily rainfall records will
be broken. The heavy precipitation will move out of the area
Wednesday late afternoon as the system slides to the southeast.
