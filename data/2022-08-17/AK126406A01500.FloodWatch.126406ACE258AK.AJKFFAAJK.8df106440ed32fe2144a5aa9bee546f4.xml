<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM AKDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...The following area, Northern Inner Channels. This includes
the city of Skagway.
* WHEN...Until 10 PM AKDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, other low-lying areas and flood-prone locations.
Heavy rainfall may increase the risk of rock slide activity near
the Skagway dock.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rainfall of 0.50 to 1 inch has already fallen across the
region.  A brief lull in the heavier rainfall through
Wednesday morning will give way to the next increase in rain
associated with the atmospheric river moving through this
afternoon. An Additional 0.75 to 1.25 inches are possible.
Rises on the rivers and streams are evident and the potential
for flooding on rivers other than the Taiya remains possible.
The Taiya River has been upgraded to a warning. Please see
the appropriate product for that information.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.
