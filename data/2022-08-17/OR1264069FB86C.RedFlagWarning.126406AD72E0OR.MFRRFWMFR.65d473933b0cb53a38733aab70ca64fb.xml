<headline>Red Flag Warning issued August 17 at 9:03AM PDT until August 17 at 11:00PM PDT by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...Abundant Lightning On Dry Fuels Expected Wednesday...
.Instability increases Wednesday with scattered thunderstorms
possible. Thunderstorms are expected to start dry, and become
wetter in time. In addition to the threat of new fire starts, a
dry and unstable layer will support gusty and erratic outflow
winds with any thunderstorms. Plume-dominated fire activity will
be possible with new or existing fires due to hot, dry and
unstable conditions.
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO 11 PM PDT THIS
EVENING FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE WEATHER
ZONES 280, 281, 284, 285, 617, 620, 621, 622, 623, 624, AND 625...
The National Weather Service in Medford has issued a Red Flag
Warning, which is in effect from noon today to 11 PM PDT this
evening.
* Impacts: Lightning and high fire danger will likely result in
new fire starts. Gusty thunderstorm winds could contribute to
fire spread. Despite rainfall, initial attack resources could
be overwhelmed and holdover fires are possible.
* Affected area:
- In southern Oregon, portions of Fire Zones 620, including
Grants Pass, Cave Junction, and portions of the Rogue
River-Siskiyou National Forest.
* Thunderstorms: Isolated thunderstorms may begin early
Wednesday morning, but will likely become scattered during
the afternoon and evening with abundant lightning. Some
storms may be dry. Winds will become gusty and erratic in and
near thunderstorms.

<instruction>Abundant lightning on existing very dry fuels could cause
numerous new fire ignitions. Gusty and erratic outflow winds
could also create extreme fire growth potential.</instruction>
