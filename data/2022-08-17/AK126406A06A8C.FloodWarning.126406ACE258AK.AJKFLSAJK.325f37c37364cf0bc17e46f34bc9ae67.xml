<headline>Flood Warning issued August 17 at 12:59PM AKDT  by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1015 AM AKDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Small stream flooding caused by excessive rainfall
continues.
* WHERE...The following area, Northern Inner Channels.
* WHEN...Until 1015 AM AKDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, other low-lying
areas and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1256 PM AKDT, satellite estimates and rain gauge data
indicate heavy rain across the warned area. Rapid river rises
have already caused flooding of small streams, especially
near the Taiya River. Between 0.5 and 1 inch of rain has
fallen. Additional rainfall amounts of 0.75 to 1.25 inches
are possible.
- Areas along low lying portions of the Chilkoot Trail is the
most likely place to experience flooding.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Chillkoot Trail Flood Area and Dyea.
- For Taiya River near Skagway:
At 12:00pm the stage was 17.02 feet.
Flood Stage is 16.5 feet.
Forecast: A crest around 17.25 feet is expected around 4:00pm
to 10 pm Wednesday.
Impacts:
At 16.8 feet: Portions of the first few miles of the Chilkoot
Trail will begin to inundate with water to ankle depth.
At 17.0 feet: The National Park Service advises against
boating and other recreational water-based activities on the
Taiya River. Trail orientation and navigation begins to
become difficult and may hinder route-finding for several
hundred feet. Water will be knee deep or higher in places
along the lower portions of the trail.
At 17.5 feet: The National Park Service may close the
Chilkoot Trail due to flooding impacts associated with high
water in the surrounding watershed.
- If you live near or along Taiya River stay alert and be prepared
to take action.</description>
