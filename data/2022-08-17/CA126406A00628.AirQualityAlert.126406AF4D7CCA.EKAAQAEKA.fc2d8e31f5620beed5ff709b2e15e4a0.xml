<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 AM PDT THURSDAY...
The North Coast Unified Air Quality Management District has issued
an Air Quality Alert in effect until 11 AM PDT Thursday.
Due to persistent smoke from the Six Rivers Lightning Complex Fires,
the North Coast Unified Air Quality Management District has issued
an Air Quality Alert in effect through 11 AM PDT on Thursday for
western Trinity and northeast Humboldt counties. This includes Burnt
Ranch, Salyer, Hawkins Bar and Hyampom in Trinity county as well as

all groups of people. Everyone in these areas should limit the amount
of time they spend outdoors as much as possible. Keep windows closed,
do not run house fans that bring outside air indoors. Consider
leaving the area until smoke conditions improve if you have repeated
coughing, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, wheezing, chest
tightness or pain, palpitations, nausea, unusual fatigue, or
lightheadedness.
