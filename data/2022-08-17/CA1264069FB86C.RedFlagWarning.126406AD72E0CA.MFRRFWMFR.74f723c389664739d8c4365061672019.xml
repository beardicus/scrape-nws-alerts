<headline>Red Flag Warning issued August 17 at 9:03AM PDT until August 17 at 11:00PM PDT by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...Abundant Lightning On Dry Fuels Expected Wednesday...
.Instability increases Wednesday with scattered thunderstorms
possible. Thunderstorms are expected to start dry, and become
wetter in time. In addition to the threat of new fire starts, a
dry and unstable layer will support gusty and erratic outflow
winds with any thunderstorms. Plume-dominated fire activity will
be possible with new or existing fires due to hot, dry and
unstable conditions.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO 11 PM
PDT THIS EVENING FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE
WEATHER ZONES 280, 281, 284, 285, 617, 620, 621, 622, 623, 624,
AND 625...
* Impacts: Lightning and high fire danger will likely result in
new fire starts. Gusty thunderstorm winds could contribute to
fire spread. Despite rainfall, initial attack resources could
be overwhelmed and holdover fires are possible.
* Affected area:
- In northern CA, portions of Fire Zones 280...
281...284 and 285, including the McKinney and Yeti Fires,
Seiad Valley, Macdoel, Tennant, Canby, Alturas, and portions
of the Klamath and Modoc National Forests.
- In southern Oregon, portions of Fire Zones 617...620...621...
622...623...624...and 625, including the Windigo Fire, Ashland,
Medford, Grants Pass, Cave Junction, Prospect, Crater Lake,
Toketee Falls, Klamath Falls, Chemult, Paisley, Lakeview, and
portions of the Umpqua, Rogue River-Siskiyou, and Fremont-Winema
National Forests.
* Thunderstorms: Isolated thunderstorms may begin early
Wednesday morning, but will likely become scattered during
the afternoon and evening with abundant lightning. Some
storms may be dry. Winds will become gusty and erratic in and
near thunderstorms.

<instruction>Abundant lightning on existing very dry fuels could cause
numerous new fire ignitions. Gusty and erratic outflow winds
could also create extreme fire growth potential.</instruction>
