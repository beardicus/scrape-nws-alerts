<headline>Red Flag Warning issued August 17 at 12:25PM PDT until August 17 at 11:00PM PDT by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...Abundant Lightning On Dry Fuels Expected today and Thursday...
.Instability increases today and Thursday with scattered
thunderstorms possible. Thunderstorms are expected to start dry,
and become wetter during the day Thursday. In addition to the
threat of new fire starts, a dry and unstable layer will support
gusty and erratic outflow winds with any thunderstorms. Plume-
dominated fire activity will be possible with new or existing
fires due to hot, dry and unstable conditions, especially today.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM PDT THIS
EVENING FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONE
620...
* Impacts: Lightning and high fire danger will likely result in
new fire starts. Gusty thunderstorm winds could contribute to
fire spread. Despite rainfall, initial attack resources could
be overwhelmed and holdover fires are possible.
* Affected area: - In southern Oregon, portions of Fire Zones
620, including Grants Pass, Cave Junction, and portions of
the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest.
* Thunderstorms: Isolated to scattered this  afternoon and
evening with abundant lightning. Some storms may be dry. Winds
will become gusty and erratic in and near thunderstorms.

<instruction>Abundant lightning on existing very dry fuels could cause
numerous new fire ignitions. Gusty and erratic outflow winds
could also create extreme fire growth potential.</instruction>
