Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A series of atmospheric rivers will bring periods of
widespread heavy rain through early next week. After the
Cascades experience heavy snow accumulations through Saturday
morning, rain will move in which will encourage excessive
runoff. Total rain amounts for the entire weekend range
between 3.0-5.0 inches along the coast, 4.5-6.5 inches over
the Willapa Hills and Oregon Coast Range, and 3-4 inches
across the interior lowlands, with 4.0-7.0 inches of rain
expected over the Cascades, Cascade foothills, and western
Columbia River Gorge. 2.5-3.5 inches of rain is expected for
central Columbia River Gorge and Upper Hood River Valley.
Localized heavy rain will lead to higher rain totals.
