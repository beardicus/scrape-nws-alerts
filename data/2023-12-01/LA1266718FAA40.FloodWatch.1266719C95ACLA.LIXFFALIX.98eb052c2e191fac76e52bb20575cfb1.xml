<headline>Flood Watch issued December 01 at 2:48PM CST  by NWS New Orleans</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM CST THIS EVENING THROUGH LATE
TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of southeast Louisiana, including the following
parishes, East Baton Rouge, Iberville and West Baton Rouge.
* WHEN...From 6 PM CST this evening through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Another round of showers and thunderstorms are anticipated
tonight and some locations could see multiple storms
initially before a more well defined line of storms develop
allowing it to push east. This is also expected to occur over
locations that saw around 2 to more than 5 inches of rain
last night and given the primed conditions rain could quickly
runoff leading to some areas of flash flooding. In addition
rainfall intensity will be high leading which will quickly
add up and could lead to water piling up in the more urban
areas leading to isolated flash flooding.

should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.</instruction>
