<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT...
The following message is transmitted at the request of the New Mexico
Departments of Health and Environment, United States Forest Service
and the Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality Response Program.
* WHAT... Smoke transport will continue toward the east-northeast
through the remainder of the afternoon and evening as strong west-
southwest winds combined with very dry air maintain widespread
critical fire weather conditions. Thereafter, significant changes
in the weather going into the weekend mainly over northern, central
and eastern New Mexico. A potent late season storm system sweeping
through Colorado and northern New Mexico will send an unseasonably
cool air mass southward. Gusty northeast and easterly winds
developing along and east of the central mountain chain and through
the gaps along the Rio Grande Valley will signal the arrival of this
cooler air beginning late tonight but moreso Saturday and Saturday
evening. This shift in the wind direction will push wildfire
smoke farther west and north with the potential for significant
impacts expanding along the Rio Grande Valley west of the Sangre de
Cristos, as well as areas south and southwest of the Hermits Peak
Calf Canyon fire perimeter to include Pecos Canyon, Glorieta and
Santa Fe. The incoming cold front will have negligible impact for
southwest areas of the state overall with continued breezy and
locally critical wind/low RH conditions through the weekend
expected.
* WHERE... Locations most likely to experience the most significant
impacts from smoke include the following counties:  Catron,
western Colfax, northwest Lincoln, Los Alamos, western Mora, eastern
Rio Arriba, eastern Sandoval, western San Miguel, northern Santa
Fe, Socorro, Taos, southwest Torrance. More details on impacted
locations and latest air quality information can be found
athttps://fire.airnow.gov
* WHEN... Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1pm MDT
Sunday, May 22
* IMPACTS...Those with conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and heart
disease will be especially vulnerable to impacts from poor air
quality, as will adults over age 65, young children, and pregnant
women if smoke concentrations become unhealthy.
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method available
at https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/IndoorQuality.html and
https://cv.nmhealth.org
New Mexicans will also need to take steps to keep their homes cool to
avoid heat-related illnesses. NMDOH offers tips here:
