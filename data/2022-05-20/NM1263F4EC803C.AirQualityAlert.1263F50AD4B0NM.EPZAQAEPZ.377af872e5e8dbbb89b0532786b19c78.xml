<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM MDT SUNDAY...
The New Mexico Departments of Health and Environment has issued an
Air Quality Alert, until 1 PM MDT Sunday.
An Air Quality Alert for Smoke has been issued.
* WHAT... Smoke transport will continue toward the east-northeast
through the remainder of the afternoon and evening as strong west-
southwest winds combined with very dry air maintain widespread
critical fire weather conditions. Thereafter, significant changes
in the weather going into the weekend mainly over northern, central
and eastern New Mexico. A potent late season storm system sweeping
through Colorado and northern New Mexico will send an unseasonably
cool air mass southward. Gusty northeast and easterly winds
developing along and east of the central mountain chain and through
the gaps along the Rio Grande Valley will signal the arrival of
this cooler air beginning late tonight but moreso Saturday and
Saturday evening. This shift in the wind direction will push
wildfire smoke farther west and north with the potential for
significant impacts expanding along the Rio Grande Valley west of
the Sangre de Cristos, as well as areas south and southwest of the
Hermits Peak Calf Canyon fire perimeter to include Pecos Canyon,
Glorieta and Santa Fe. The incoming cold front will have negligible
impact for southwest areas of the state overall with continued
breezy and locally critical wind/low RH conditions through the
weekend expected.
* WHERE...Locations most likely to experience the most significant
impacts from smoke include the following counties: Catron, western
Colfax, northwest Lincoln, Los Alamos, western Mora, eastern Rio
Arriba, eastern Sandoval, western San Miguel, northern Santa Fe,
Socorro, Taos, southwest Torrance. More details on impacted
locations and latest air quality information can be found at
https://fire.airnow.gov
* WHEN... Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1pm MDT
Sunday, May 22
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method
available at
https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
