<headline>Wind Advisory issued May 20 at 1:59AM MDT until May 20 at 6:00PM MDT by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>...WIND ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM THIS MORNING TO 6 PM MDT
THIS EVENING...
...FREEZE WARNING IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT TONIGHT TO 8 AM MDT
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Freeze Warning, sub-freezing temperatures as
low as 30 expected. For the Wind Advisory, northwest winds 25
to 35 mph with gusts up to 50 mph expected.
* WHERE...The Sturgis/Piedmont Foot Hills.
* WHEN...For the Freeze Warning, from midnight tonight to 8 AM
MDT Saturday. For the Wind Advisory, from 6 AM this morning to
6 PM MDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Sudden wind gusts can cause drivers to lose control,
especially in lightweight or high profile vehicles. Strong
winds can cause blowing dust, reduced visibility, and flying
debris. Frost and freeze conditions will kill crops, other
sensitive vegetation.</description>
<instruction>Use extra caution when driving, especially if operating a high
profile vehicle. Secure outdoor objects.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
