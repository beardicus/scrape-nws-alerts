<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY FOR SNOWMELT IN EFFECT UNTIL 145 PM AKDT MONDAY
FOR THE NORTHERN COPPER RIVER BASIN INCLUDING MOOSE CREEK IN
GLENNALLEN, THE GULKANA RIVER, AND AROUND LAKE LOUISE...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by snowmelt is occurring.
* WHERE...The northern Copper River Basin, including Moose Creek in
Glennallen, the Gulkana River, and around Lake Louise.
* WHEN...Until 145 PM AKDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding of Moose Creek and low-lying and poor
drainage areas in Glennallen, minor flooding on the Gulkana River,
and flooding of the Lake Louise Road are occurring. Expect rises
and near-bankfull conditions on other rivers and streams in the
area, including the Gakona River.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 250 PM AKDT, river gauge reports indicate rises in water
levels from snowmelt in the advisory area. Minor flooding is
ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
- Above normal temperatures rising into the upper 60s this
weekend in the Copper River Basin will increase higher
elevation snowmelt. Much of the Eastern Alaska Range had a
record amount of snow on the ground for mid-May. Significant
snowmelt runoff this weekend will move down into rivers and
streams in the Northern Copper River Basin, including Moose
Creek in Glennallen, the Gulkana River, and into the Lake
Louise drainage basin.
On Thursday morning, DOT officials reported that Moose Creek
in Glennallen had jumped its bank and split into two channels
and is impacting roads and buildings in the Glennallen area
north of the Glenn Highway.
On Thursday afternoon, water levels are climbing in the Lake
Louise Road area due to increasing snowmelt rates in the
area. Water overtopping the road is possible. Stay tuned for
further details and updates.
