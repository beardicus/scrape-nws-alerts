<description>...THE FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1230 PM CDT FOR DOOR
COUNTY...
At 1112 AM CDT, reports from automated weather stations indicated
that up to around 4 inches of rain had fallen in portions of
southern Door County around the Sturgeon Bay area. This was
resulting in minor flooding.
The heaviest and most persistent rains have now shifted south and
east of the Sturgeon Bay area. Up to another inch or so of rain is
possible south of Sturgeon Bay, with lighter amounts to the north.
This will result in a continuation of minor flooding across southern
Door County.
Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Sturgeon Bay, Whitefish Bay, Brussels, Forestville, Clay Banks,
Valmy, Rosiere, Shoemaker Point, Carlsville and Namur.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
A Flood Advisory means river or stream flows are elevated, or ponding
of water in urban or other areas is occurring.</instruction>
