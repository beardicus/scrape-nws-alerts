<headline>Red Flag Warning issued June 26 at 12:53PM MST until June 26 at 8:00PM MST by NWS Flagstaff</headline>
<description>...Critical Fire Weather Conditions Persist...
.A prolonged period of windy conditions, combined with low teen to
single digit RHs, will result in a multi day stretch of critical fire
weather conditions. Conditions start today for areas along and north of
the Mogollon Rim where the RFW is out. Strongest winds will be Tuesday
and will occur at both higher and lower elevations, resulting in a
widespread RFW that encompasses almost all of northern Arizona. Windy
conditions will persist into Wednesday, but be shifting eastward. A
Fire Weather Watch has been issued for Wednesday because of this.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM MST /9 PM MDT/
THIS EVENING FOR FOR MUCH OF NORTHERN ARIZONA FROM THE MOGOLLON
RIM NORTH AND NORTHEAST...
...A NEW RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM MST /NOON MDT/ TO 8 PM
MST /9 PM MDT/ TUESDAY DUE TO STRONG WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE
