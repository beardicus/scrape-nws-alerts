<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 09 at 3:20AM CST until January 10 at 6:00AM CST by NWS GreenBay</headline>
<description>...HEAVY SNOW AND STRONG WINDS EXPECTED TODAY INTO TONIGHT...
.A strong winter system will move north into the Great Lakes.
Areas of freezing drizzle will precede the snow, resulting
in icy roads, especially over northern Wisconsin. Light snow will
continue to overspread the region this morning. The snow should
remain light in most areas through early afternoon, then become
moderate to heavy later this afternoon into early this evening. The
bulk of the accumulating snow will fall late this afternoon and
evening. Wind gusts from the northeast to north will also increase
to 30 to 40 mph during the late afternoon into this evening,
reducing visibility and resulting in patchy blowing and drifting
snow in open areas. The greatest accumulations are expected in the
eastern Fox Valley and lakeshore areas, where some lake enhancement
is anticipated. Hazardous travel conditions will develop, with the
worst conditions occurring during the afternoon and early evening.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM CST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 6 and
9 inches.
e. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph. Winds gusting as high as 45
mph will create areas of blowing snow and reduced visibilities for
motorists.
* WHERE...Winnebago and Outagamie Counties.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM CST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will
likely become slick and hazardous. Travel could be very difficult.
Areas of blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. The
hazardous conditions could impact the Tuesday morning and evening
commutes.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road conditions for
the state you are calling from can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.
People should delay all travel if possible. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution and be prepared for sudden
changes in visibility. Leave plenty of room between you and the
motorist ahead of you, and allow extra time to reach your
destination. Avoid sudden braking or acceleration, and be especially
cautious on hills or when making turns. Make sure your car is
winterized and in good working order.</instruction>
