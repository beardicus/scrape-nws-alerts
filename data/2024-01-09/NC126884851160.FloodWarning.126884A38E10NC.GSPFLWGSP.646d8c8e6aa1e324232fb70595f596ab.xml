<headline>Flood Warning issued January 09 at 4:20PM EST until January 11 at 4:00PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg SC has
issued a Flood Warning for the following rivers in North Carolina...
French Broad River At Marshall affecting Madison County.
.Heavy rain has ended across Madison County.  However, storm-total
rainfall of 2-3.5 inches occurred across the county with more
significant rainfall of 6-7 inches occurring in the headwaters of
the French Broad River.  Therefore, very high local and upstream
flows are causing significant rises along the French Broad River
with nuisance to Minor flooding along the river from Marshall to Hot
Springs underway.  This will result in common, deeper flooding
of low-lying areas adjacent to the French Broad River with
lesser impacts to vulnerable property.  Residents are
advised to move vulnerable property to higher ground and stay
up-to-date by monitoring the latest river levels and forecasts.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL THURSDAY AFTERNOON...

* IMPACTS...At 8.0 feet, Minor Flood Stage. The French Broad River
may be approaching some buildings on Blannahassett Island and
approaching residential yards along Island Road.  Flooding along
the lowest elevations of Rollins Road is possible. The river may
be approaching the railroad tracks in the Back Street area.
At 9.0 feet, Minor flooding continues. The French Broad River may
be approaching the railroad tracks and starting to flood areas
between Highway 70 and the normal riverbank. Floodwaters may begin
to reach buildings along Back Street and on Blannahassett Island.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 4:01 PM EST Tuesday the stage was 7.9 feet and rising

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Caution is urged when walking near riverbanks.
Even 6 inches of fast-moving flood water can knock you off your feet
and a depth of 2 feet will float your car. Never try to walk, swim,
or drive through such swift water. If you come upon flood waters,
stop, turn around and go another way.
