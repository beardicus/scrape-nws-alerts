<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 09 at 9:20AM EST until January 10 at 11:00AM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM THIS EVENING TO
11 AM EST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow and mixed precipitation expected. Total snow and
sleet accumulations between 6 and 12 inches with higher amounts in
excess of a foot possible across the higher terrain and ice
accumulations around a light glaze. Winds gusting as high as 50
mph.
* WHERE...Southern Somerset, Central Somerset, Northern Franklin,
Northern Oxford, and Southern Franklin Counties.
* WHEN...From 9 PM this evening to 11 AM EST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Significant snowfall and periods of heavy snowfall rates
will combine with low visibility to create very dangerous driving
conditions. Heavy, wet snow will cause weighted tree limbs of
conifers and leafed trees, leading to snapped branches. Strong,
gusty winds are expected with this snowstorm as well and will
contribute to additional power outages especially in downsloping
areas to the northeast of larger mountain features.
Snow will eventually change over to rain Wednesday morning, with a
period of sleet and/or freezing rain at transition which will cause
slushy roads and further degrade driving conditions. Plan on
delaying travel to allow time for road conditions to improve. The
hazardous conditions will impact the Wednesday morning commute.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road conditions can
be obtained by going to newengland511.org</instruction>
