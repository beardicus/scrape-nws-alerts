...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM EST

For the High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking waves of
up to 12 feet expected in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood
Advisory, minor coastal flooding expected.
* WHERE...South Walton, Coastal Bay and Coastal Gulf Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Saturday

* IMPACTS...Peak water levels of 2 to 3 feet above normally dry
ground are expected today. This will result in flooding of
beach access areas and parking lots. Breaking waves can sweep
people off jetties and docks, and into dangerous seas. Life-
threatening swimming conditions and significant beach erosion
can be expected. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers
away from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other waterside
infrastructure.</instruction>
