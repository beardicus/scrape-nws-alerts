<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 09 at 2:00AM PST until January 11 at 4:00AM PST by NWS LasVegas</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM WEDNESDAY TO 4 AM
PST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Snow and high wind expected. Total snow accumulations of
3 to 5 inches up to 9000 feet and up to 10 inches above 9000
feet. Winds gusting as high as 80 mph.
* WHERE...Eastern Sierra Slopes including Aspendell.
* WHEN...From 10 AM Wednesday to 4 AM PST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on minor road impacts such as slick roads due to
a few inches of snow on roadways. Very strong winds could cause
extensive tree damage and the combination of snow and strong
winds will result in blowing snow that will reduce driving
visibility considerably.</description>

cause primarily travel difficulties. Expect snow covered roads
and limited visibilities, and use caution while driving.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
