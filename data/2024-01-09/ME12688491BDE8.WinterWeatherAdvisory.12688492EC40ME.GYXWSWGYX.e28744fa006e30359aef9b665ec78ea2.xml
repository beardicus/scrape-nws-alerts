<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 09 at 11:26PM EST until January 10 at 7:00AM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 AM EST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation. Additional snow accumulations up to 3
inches for a storm total of 2 to 8 inches, sleet accumulations up
to one tenth of an inch, and ice accumulations around a light
glaze. Winds gusting as high as 60 mph after the snow has fallen.
* WHERE...Portions of southwest Maine and central and northern New
Hampshire.
* WHEN...Until 7 AM EST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...The potential exists for snowbands that will bring
periods of locally heavy snowfall, which will lead to rapid snow
accumulations and extremely dangerous travel conditions. Snow will
change over to rain causing a period of slushy roads that will
lead to extremely slick conditions. Plan on delaying travel to
allow time for road conditions to improve. Heavy wet snow will
cause weighted tree limbs, leading to snapped branches. Isolated
to scattered outages possible. Even light snowfall amounts can
accumulate on roads and cause dangerous driving conditions due to
snow covered roads. The hazardous conditions could impact the
Wednesday morning commute. Strong winds could cause extensive
damage to trees and power lines.</description>

conditions can be obtained by going to newengland511.org</instruction>
