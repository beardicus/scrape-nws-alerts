<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 09 at 8:06PM PST until January 10 at 6:00AM PST by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...BLIZZARD CONDITIONS EXPECTED FOR THE CASCADE PASSES AND ABOVE
THROUGH WEDNESDAY...
.OVERVIEW...Strong and deep onshore flow will lead to periods of
heavy snow, strong winds, and near zero visibility for the
Cascades, especially for exposed areas above 3000 feet. This has
prompted us to issue a rare Blizzard Warning for the Cascade
passes and above, with Winter Storm Warnings extending as low as
1500 to 2000 feet in the Cascade foothills. By the time snow
showers decrease Wednesday, elevations 3000 feet and above will
likely be measuring their snow in feet, rather than inches.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM PST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 4
inches.
* WHERE...In Oregon, Lower Columbia. In Washington, I-5 Corridor
in Cowlitz County and Greater Vancouver Area.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM PST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Greatest snow accumulations are expected
north and east of Vancouver.</description>
