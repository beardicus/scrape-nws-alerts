Mountain Home, Laurel Park, Saluda, Chimney Rock Village,
Dupont State Forest,  Bat Cave, Jones Gap State Park, Chimney

South Center Plaza. Flooding from these tributaries may
approach first floor levels in nearby buildings. Flooding is
also likely along Dana Road and Tracy Grove Road near Four
Seasons Boulevard.
