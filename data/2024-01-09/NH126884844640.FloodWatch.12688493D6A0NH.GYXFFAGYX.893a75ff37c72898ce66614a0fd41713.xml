<headline>Flood Watch issued January 09 at 11:00AM EST until January 10 at 1:00PM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>.Heavy rain will fall on snow leading to melt across southern New
Hampshire and southwestern Maine early Wednesday. Recent snow is
expected to almost completely melt out within the watch area. This
will combine with 1 to 2 inches of rainfall to produce flash
flooding of small streams and poor drainage in urban areas. The
deeper snowpack from the foothills northward is expected to hold,
reducing the flood risk in those areas.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 10 PM EST THIS EVENING THROUGH
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall and snow melt
continue to be possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Maine, including the following areas,
Androscoggin, Central Interior Cumberland, Coastal Cumberland,
Coastal York, Interior York, Kennebec, Lincoln and Sagadahoc and
New Hampshire, including the following areas, Belknap, Coastal
Rockingham, Eastern Hillsborough, Interior Rockingham, Merrimack,
Strafford and Western And Central Hillsborough.
* WHEN...From 10 PM EST this evening through Wednesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Flooding is likely to occur in poor drainage and urban
areas. Storm drains and ditches may become clogged with snow and
other debris. Rapid rises along small streams will also be
possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Heavy rainfall along with warm temperatures will cause
melting of the snow pack south of the foothills. The runoff
will be rapid due to the frozen ground conditions, supporting
the potential for flash flooding in urban areas as well as
small stream crossings. Travel across the watch area will be
impacted as roads are likely to flood.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor the latest forecast and be alert for possible
Flood Warnings. Those living or commuting in areas prone to flooding
should be prepared to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
