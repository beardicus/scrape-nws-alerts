<description>...WINDS INCREASING ALONG THE COAST...
...HIGH WIND WARNING CONTINUES...
Winds will continue to strengthen across the coastal counties
through the afternoon. Trees have been reported blown down in many
areas since sunrise and additional wind damage is likely. Wind
gusts in excess of 50 mph have been common this morning and the
risk for gusts near 60 mph will steadily increase through the
afternoon. Power outages are likely.
Even stronger winds could occur on elevated bridges such as the
the Ravenel Bridge, the Don Holt Bridge, the James B. Edwards
Bridge, the Ben Sawyer Bridge, the Isle of Palms Connector, the
Amos Nathaniel Rodgers Bridge, the McKinley Washington Junior
Bridge and the Woods Memorial Bridge. Dangerous driving conditions
are likely on these bridges. Heed any potential bridge closures
or warnings from local officials.
A line of strong to severe thunderstorms will move across the
coast later this afternoon. Be prepared to take immediate action
should Severe Thunderstorm or Tornado Warnings be issued for your
area. A Tornado Watch is in effect through 6 PM.</description>
