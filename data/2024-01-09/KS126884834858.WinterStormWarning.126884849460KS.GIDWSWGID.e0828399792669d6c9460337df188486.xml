<description>...WINTRY WEATHER CONDITIONS IMPROVING WITH TIME TODAY...
...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST TODAY...
...BLIZZARD WARNING IS CANCELLED...
* WHAT...Lingering light snow and blowing snow that has already
fallen. Additional snow accumulations less than 1 inch.
North-northwest winds still gusting 35 to 45 MPH this morning, but
very slowly decreasing with time.
* WHERE...Osborne and Smith Counties.
* WHEN...Until noon CST today.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Although the vast
majority of falling snow has ended, continued strong
north-northwest winds this morning will result in continued
blowing snow, which could still reduce visibility and cause
near-blizzard conditions, especially in open, rural areas. The
hazardous conditions could impact the Tuesday morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Wind speeds will steadily decrease with time
this afternoon, resulting in improving conditions.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road conditions for
the state you are calling from can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
