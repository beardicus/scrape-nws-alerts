<headline>Rip Current Statement issued January 09 at 3:27AM EST until January 14 at 12:00AM EST by NWS Tallahassee</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM EST THIS
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 AM THIS MORNING
TO 1 AM EST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of up to 8
feet expected in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Warning,
minor to moderate coastal flooding expected.
* WHERE...Coastal Franklin County.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Saturday
evening. For the High Surf Advisory, until 10 PM EST this
evening. For the Coastal Flood Warning, from 7 AM this morning
to 1 AM EST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Water levels will be highest east of Carrabelle
where the high tide will line up with the strongest onshore
winds. From Carrabelle to the Ochlockonee River Entrance,
water levels along the coast are expected to reach 3 to 4 feet
above normally dry ground, resulting in flooding of coastal
roads and inundation of non-elevated structures along the
coast. West of Carrabelle, water levels of 2 to 3 feet above
normally dry ground are expected, which will result in
flooding of low lying roadways near the immediate coast. Some
shoreline erosion will occur. Dangerous swimming and surfing
conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep
even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Stay back from the water due to dangerous surf conditions. Do not
go swimming!</instruction>
