<headline>High Surf Warning issued January 09 at 5:59AM PST until January 10 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Seattle</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 PM PST THIS
AFTERNOON...
...HIGH SURF WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, significant coastal
flooding expected. Inundation of 2 to 3 feet above ground level
is possible along shorelines and low-lying coastal areas. For
the High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking waves expected
in the surf zone.
* WHERE...North Coast and Central Coast zones.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, until 2 PM PST this
afternoon. For the High Surf Warning, from 7 AM this morning
to 10 AM PST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Significant coastal flooding due to high tides and
storm surge is expected. This is expected to lead to numerous
road closures. Low lying property including homes, businesses,
and some critical infrastructure may be inundated. Shoreline
erosion or damage may occur. Breaking waves can sweep people
off jetties and docks, and into dangerous seas. Life-
threatening swimming conditions and significant beach erosion
can be expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Strong low pressure continues to move just
north of the region today, which, when combined with strong
onshore flow and large breaking waves, is enhancing the coastal
flooding threat.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Inundation above ground level refers to the height above the Mean
Higher High Water (MHHW) level.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other waterside
infrastructure.</instruction>
