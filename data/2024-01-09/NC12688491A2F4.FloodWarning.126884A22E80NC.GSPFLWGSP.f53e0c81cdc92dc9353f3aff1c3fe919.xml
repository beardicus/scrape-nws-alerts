<headline>Flood Warning issued January 09 at 10:57PM EST until January 11 at 7:00AM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM EST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of Henderson County in western North Carolina.
* WHEN...Until 1000 AM EST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1050 PM EST, Rain gauges recorded rainfall totals of 4 to
6 inches in the past 24 hours over the Mud Creek and Bat Fork
Creek stream basins. The runoff from this recent heavy
rainfall continues to produce very elevated water levels in
these basins around the Hendersonville area. Flooding is
ongoing in the warning area and is likely to continue through
the early morning hours Wednesday.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Hendersonville, Flat Rock, Mountain Home, Laurel Park, Valley
Hill, East Flat Rock and Dana.
- Flooding is most likely along Mud Creek at North Main Street
in Hendersonville. Significant flooding will continue in
currently inundated areas, with several feet of water likely
in and around William H. King Memorial Park and Jackson Park.
Waters may approach first-floor levels of some buildings, but
it does appear as if Mud Creek is cresting late this evening.
Flooding is also likely occurring along Bat Fork Creek, with
New Hope Road, Dana Road, and Tracy Grove Road likely
impacted.
