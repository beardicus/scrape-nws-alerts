<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 09 at 9:54AM CST until January 10 at 6:00AM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Snow Continuing and Travel is Slowly Deteriorating...
.Most of the area saw morning snows with the heaviest band from
northeast Iowa into central Wisconsin. There, 5 to 8 inches has
been reported as of 9 am. Roads were snow covered for the most
part although most interstates across the area are showing some
pavement per D O T road cameras.
As the afternoon progresses, snow will diminish across far
northcentral Wisconsin into southeast Minnesota. However, areas
near, south, and east of La Crosse Wisconsin will continue to have
accumulating snow. The heaviest snow will fall across southwest
Wisconsin and far northeast Iowa where 3 to 4 additional inches is
expected this afternoon. Snow will then diminish from west to
east there in the evening.
Highest overall storm total accumulations of 9 to 12 inches are
expected from northeast Iowa into southwest and central Wisconsin.
Northwest winds will increase as well with gusts 30 to 40 mph at
times this afternoon through tonight. As a result, blowing and
drifting snow may rapidly reduce visibilities and driving
conditions especially along unsheltered areas and ridgetops. Downed
trees and power outages are also possible.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM CST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow. Additional snow accumulations of 2 to 4
inches. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of northeast Iowa, southeast Minnesota and
west central Wisconsin.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM CST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Patchy blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the evening commute.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
