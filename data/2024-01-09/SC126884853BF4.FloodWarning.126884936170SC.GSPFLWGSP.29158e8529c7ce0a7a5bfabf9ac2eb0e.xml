<headline>Flood Warning issued January 09 at 5:29PM EST until further notice by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>.Waters levels are exceeding full pool conditions on the reservoir
at the Ninety Nine Islands Dam on the Broad River. Levels will
likely continue to rise through the evening hours, and flooding
impacts are likely on the area immediately adjacent to the river
channel.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM EST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...The Broad River channel upstream and downstream from the
Ninety Islands Dam in Cherokee and York Counties in Upstate South
Carolina.
* WHEN...Until 1000 AM EST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 517 PM EST, Water levels on the Ninety Nine Islands Dam
reservoir showed an elevation of 105.8 feet, above the full
pool condition of 104 feet. Water levels continue to rise as
runoff from heavy rainfall in upstream areas continues to
work its way down the Broad River channel. At these water
levels, flooding will likely develop on parts of Ninety Nine
Ferry Road, Cherokee Ford Complex Access Road, and on
downstream boat landings. Additional flooding is likely along
and near Peoples Creek due to high water levels upstream of
the dam. Conditions will need to be monitored overnight into
Wednesday at the Highway 211 bridge as well as Kings Branch
and Guymore Creek.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Cherokee Falls.
