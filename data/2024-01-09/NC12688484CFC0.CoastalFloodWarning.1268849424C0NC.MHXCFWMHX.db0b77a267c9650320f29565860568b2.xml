WEDNESDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EST
WEDNESDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, 2 to 4 feet of
inundation above ground level expected in low- lying areas
near shorelines and tidal waterways. For the High Surf
Advisory, large breaking waves of 10 to 18 feet expected in
the surf zone.
* WHERE...Ocracoke Island and Hatteras Island.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, until 3 PM EST
Wednesday. For the High Surf Advisory, until midnight EST
Wednesday night.
* IMPACTS...2 to 4 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in a threat of property damage. Numerous roads may be
closed. Low lying property including homes, businesses, and some
critical infrastructure may be inundated. In some areas,
battering waves will cause additional damage to property.
Moderate to significant ocean overwash is likely, mainly from
Oregon Inlet to Ocracoke. This will likely impact portions of
Highway 12, which may be impassable at times, especially around
times of high tide. High tide is around 5:30 PM today and 6 AM
Wednesday. Moderate to significant beach erosion expected, along
with very rough surf.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Both soundside and oceanside flooding is
expected into Wednesday. Be alert for rapid water level rises tonight
and early Wednesday on the soundside as winds shift to the
southwest and west.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.</instruction>
