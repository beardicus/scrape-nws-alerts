<description>...SNOW AND STRONG WINDS EXPECTED THIS AFTERNOON INTO TONIGHT...
.A strong winter system will move north into the Great Lakes. Light
to moderate snow will spread back into much of eastern WI this
afternoon. A period of heavy snow is possible in the Fox Valley and
lake shore this afternoon into early this evening, impacting the
evening commute. Wind gusts from the northeast to north will also
increase to 30 to 40 mph during the afternoon into this evening,
reducing visibility and resulting in blowing and drifting snow in
open areas. Hazardous travel conditions are expected at times, with
the worst conditions occurring during the afternoon and early
evening.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM CST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Snow and blowing snow. Additional snow accumulations
between 2 and 4 inches. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph. Warmer
temperatures near Lake Michigan will bring mainly rain through
early afternoon, changing to snow by early evening. Some drizzle
or freezing drizzle is also possible during lulls in the snow.
* WHERE...Calumet, Manitowoc, Brown, Door, and Kewaunee Counties.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM CST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be difficult. Areas of blowing snow could
significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions will
impact the evening commute.</description>
