- At 921 PM EST, Rain gauge reported indicated rainfall totals
of 3 to 4 inches over much of the area in the past 24 hours,

likely to develop along and near the Rocky River channel as
the high water conditions move downstream.

Downtown Concord, West Concord, Harrisburg, Mt Pleasant,
Midland and Charlotte Motor Speedway.
- Flooding is most likely along the Rocky River above Irish
Buffalo Creek west of Georgeville, and also along Rocky River
locations downstream to the east and south. Flooding is
likely occurring along Mount Pleasant Road, NC Route 200, and
Bonanza Drive. Additional flooding will continue along the
Dutch Buffalo Creek, impacting Bowman Barrier Road between
Long Run Farm Road and the Mount Pleasant City Limits.
Flooding may continue along Coddle Creek at Roberta Road as
well as Clarke Creek near Harrisburg.
