<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM EST THIS AFTERNOON
THROUGH WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of New Jersey, including the following areas,
Hunterdon, Morris, Somerset, Sussex and Warren and Pennsylvania,
including the following areas, Berks, Carbon, Eastern Chester,
Eastern Montgomery, Lehigh, Monroe, Northampton, Upper Bucks,
Western Chester and Western Montgomery.
* WHEN...From 1 PM EST this afternoon through Wednesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Area creeks and streams are running high and could flood with more
heavy rain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rainfall of 2 to 3 inches with locally up to 4 inches
possible later today and tonight, with the heaviest rain
occurring later this afternoon and this evening. The ground
remains very saturated following multiple rounds of heavy
rainfall over the last month. A period of higher hourly
rainfall rates is possible tonight which would enhance the
potential for flooding, particularly in the more urban areas.
The combination of snow melt and heavy rain may significantly
elevate the flooding risk, especially across northeast
Pennsylvania and northern New Jersey.
