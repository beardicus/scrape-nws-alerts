<instruction>Heavy rain is increasing the risk of landslides, especially in areas
where slides have occurred in the past. Be especially alert if you
are near a stream, especially at the base of a mountain or in a
cove. Watch for loose-moving soil and rocks or a sudden increase in
streamflow. Leave the area quickly if this is observed. When driving
along roads where the terrain is steep or rocky, watch and listen
for falling rocks, mud, trees and other debris.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.</instruction>
