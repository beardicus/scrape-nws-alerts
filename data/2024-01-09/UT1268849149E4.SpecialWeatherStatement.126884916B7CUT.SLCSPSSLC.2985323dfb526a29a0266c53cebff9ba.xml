<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WILL AFFECT CENTRAL TOOELE COUNTY...
At 629 PM MST...A snow squall was along a line extending from 6 miles
southwest of Great Salt Lake South of the Causeway to 7 miles west of
Delle to 12 miles east of Wendover...and moving southeast at 35 mph.
Locations impacted include...
Grantsville, Wendover, Dugway English Village, Tooele Army Depot,
Clive, Skull Valley, Utah Test and Training Range South, Knolls,
Tooele Army Depot South, Dugway Proving Ground Test Range, Stockton,
Rush Valley, and Bonneville Salt Flats.
This includes Interstate 80 in Utah between mile markers 0 and 55,
and between mile markers 81 and 84.
* winds in excess of 35 mph are possible with this squall.
* visibilities will drop quickly to less than a half mile in this
squall.
Rapid visibility reduction and potentially icy roads are likely to
produce hazardous driving conditions. Travel is not advised during
this snow squall. If you are traveling and encounter adverse winter
driving conditions, reduce speed and make sure headlights are on to
increase the visibility of your vehicle to those around you.</description>
