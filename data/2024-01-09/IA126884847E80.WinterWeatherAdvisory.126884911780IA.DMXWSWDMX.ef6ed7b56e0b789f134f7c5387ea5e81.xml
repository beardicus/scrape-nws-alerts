<description>...Moderate to Heavy Snowfall Continues Early This Afternoon...
.Moderate to heavy snow continues to make it`s way east through
the state early this morning. Snowfall has begun to taper off in
western Iowa, with the bands of heavier snowfall now oriented SW
to NE over the eastern half of Iowa. Snowfall measurements have
begun to pour in from throughout the state this morning, with
values ranging between 6 to 11 inches over central and southern
Iowa, then lower amounts from 3 to 6 inches north and west. Snow
amounts of 4 to 7 inches have been reported in the east, but
snow continues to fall in this region. Poor road conditions have
developed throughout the state this morning, with multiple
accidents being reported. Make sure to stay off roads if at all
possible, and take it slow if you must be out.
In addition to the snowfall, breezy winds have developed over much
of the state, with gusts generally around 30 to 40 mph, and a few
locations seeing occasional gusts over 45 mph. As a result,
blowing and drifting snow is expected through the afternoon and
evening, especially in areas where snow continues to fall. Gusty
winds will also continue to cause reduced visibilities and
prolong poor driving conditions even after the falling snow
concludes this evening. Winds then diminish tonight.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM CST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Light snow ending, but blowing snow continues through the
afternoon. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...North Central Iowa.
* WHEN...From now to 6 PM CST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slick road conditions. Patchy blowing snow
will reduce visibility, perhaps significantly at times.
Hazardous travel conditions will impact this morning`s commute
with lingering impacts into the evening commute.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
For the latest travel conditions, check the Iowa 511 app,
