<headline>Flood Warning issued January 09 at 7:27PM EST until January 11 at 1:11AM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM EST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall and dam gate releases
is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of piedmont North Carolina, including the
following counties, Alexander, Catawba and Iredell.
* WHEN...Until 900 AM EST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Unusual, damaging flooding is developing with
considerable impacts to property.  Floodwaters reaching depths of
4-6 feet may be impacting yards, docks, and lake-access areas.
Flooding less than 1 ft deep may begin for first-floor building
elevations.  Some homes and businesses may be stranded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 644 PM EST, Rainfall accumulations of 3-5 inches on
Tuesday over the headwaters of the Catawba River, Johns
River, and associated tributaries has caused high flows and
rising lake pool elevations along the upper Catawba River.
This has caused Lookout Shoals Lake to exceed full pool.
Lookout Shoals is expected to exceed the Moderate Flood Stage
of 104.0 feet.  Between 103 and 104 feet, significant
inundation of low-lying areas including residential yards,
docks, and boat-launch areas is ongoing around Lookout Shoals
Lake.  Lake floodwaters may be approaching the crawl space of
4867 Longfield St.  At 104 feet, lake floodwaters are
approaching some homes in the Carpenters Cove community and
electricity shutoff is imminent.  Residents along Longfield
St and in the Carpenters Cove community should have completed
the protection of property adjacent to the lake and be
prepared to follow guidance from Catawba County Emergency
Management.
- The latest pool elevations for the upper Catawba River lakes
are as follows (Full Pool is 100.0 feet):
Lake James: 97.14 feet and rising steadily.
Lake Rhodhiss: 99.03 feet and rising rapidly.
Lake Hickory: 97.81 feet and rising rapidly.
Lookout Shoals Lake: 100.81 feet and rising rapidly.
Forecast: Lookout Shoals Lake is projected by Duke Energy to
reach or exceed 104.0 feet Tuesday night as water is moved
through the Catawba River reservoir system.  No additional
rainfall will occur until Friday.  However, it will take some
time for Catawba River high flows to move through the
reservoir system.

projections, and dam releases from Duke Energy, please visit:

County Emergency Management to update their contact
information by visiting the Community Alert System web page
at: www.catawbacountync.gov/online-services/community-alert-
system/
