<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 09 at 7:50PM EST until January 10 at 7:00AM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 AM EST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Wet snow. Additional snow accumulations up to 3 inches for
a storm total of up to 4 inches.
* WHERE...Interior Rockingham County.
* WHEN...Until 7 AM EST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...The potential exists for snowbands that will bring
periods of locally heavy snowfall, which will lead to rapid snow
accumulations and hazardous travel conditions. Snow will change
over to rain causing a period of slushy roads that will lead to
extremely slick conditions. Plan on delaying travel to allow time
for road conditions to improve. Heavy wet snow will cause weighted
tree limbs, leading to snapped branches. Isolated to scattered
outages possible. Even light snowfall amounts can accumulate on
roads and cause dangerous driving conditions due to snow covered
roads. The hazardous conditions could impact the Wednesday morning
commute.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling. The latest road
conditions can be obtained by going to newengland511.org</instruction>
