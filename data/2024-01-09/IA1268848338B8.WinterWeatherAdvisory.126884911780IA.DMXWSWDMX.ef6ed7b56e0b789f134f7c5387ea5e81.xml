<description>...Moderate to Heavy Snowfall Continues this Morning...
.While there has been a lull in snowfall over southeastern Iowa
earlier tonight with even a few reports of freezing drizzle or
sleet, snow will fill back in over those areas. A band of moderate
to heavy snow was falling from southwest into central Iowa early
this morning with rates that may be around an inch per hour. While
snowfall measurements are sparse as they typically are at this
time of night, they have ranged from 3 to 5 inches as of midnight
with the latest unofficial total as of 3am from our office at 4.2
inches.
The highest snow rates are expected to transition into
south central into southeastern Iowa through the morning with snow
tapering off largely from west to east through the day into early
this evening. As winds increase this morning and gusts up to 40 to
45 mph develop with the falling snow, blowing and drifting snow
and reduced visibility will be a concern, particularly in open
and rural areas. While the snow will end, the blowing snow and
impacts from the event will linger longer and it is probable that
the evening commute while improved from the morning, will not be
normal winter travel conditions.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM CST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Snow. Additional snow accumulations of up to two
inches. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...North Central Iowa.
* WHEN...From now to 6 PM CST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slick road conditions. Patchy blowing snow
will reduce visibility, perhaps significantly at times.
Hazardous travel conditions will impact this morning`s commute
with lingering impacts into the evening commute.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
For the latest travel conditions, check the Iowa 511 app,
