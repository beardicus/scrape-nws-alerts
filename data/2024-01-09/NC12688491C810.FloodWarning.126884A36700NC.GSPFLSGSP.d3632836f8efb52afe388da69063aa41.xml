<headline>Flood Warning issued January 09 at 11:52PM EST until January 11 at 3:00PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in North
Carolina...
South Fork Catawba River At Lowell affecting Gaston County.
.A potent storm system produced 2.5-4.5 inches of rainfall across
the South Fork Catawba watershed from Tuesday morning through
Tuesday evening.  This rainfall quickly overwhelmed saturated soils
and resulted in excessive runoff and significant stream rises across
southeastern Burke County, Catawba County, Lincoln County, and
Gaston County, with several small tributaries of the SF Catawba
River exceeding bankfull and causing Minor to Moderate flooding of
adjacent areas.  This excessive flow has caused the SF Catawba River
near Lowell, McAdenville, and Cramerton to exceed Moderate Flood
Stage, resulting in significant lowland inundation with floodwaters
approaching vulnerable buildings and property near Cramerton.
Tributaries feeding the SF Catawba River have been stubbornly rising
through the early nighttime hours in response to impressive soil
saturation and runoff.  This has prolonged the rise downstream along
the SF Catawba River from Lowell to Cramerton, resulting in an
increase in the expected crest from 13.6 feet to near 14.2 feet.
However, most tributaries are finally cresting and receding.
Therefore, the floodwave is approaching the lower reaches of the SF
Catawba River and a crest is imminent, expected between midnight and
2am tonight.
...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Moderate flooding is occurring and moderate flooding is
forecast.
* WHERE...South Fork Catawba River at Lowell.
* WHEN...Until Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...At 14.0 feet, Moderate Flooding continues.  The South
Fork Catawba may be flooding several roads in the Cramerton area,
including Cramer Mountain Rd along Duharts Creek, Riverside Dr,
8th Ave near the South Fork Masonic Lodge and adjacent park, and
Greenwood Pl near Lakewood Park.  Significant inundation is
overwhemling Goat Island and Riverside parks.  Flooding at the
Cramerton Fire Department, Cramerton Drug Company, and the South
Fork Masonic Lodge may be ongoing or imminent.  The South Fork
Catawba River may be entering the crawl spaces of homes along
Riverside Dr between 4th St and 5th St in Cramerton.  Floodwaters
may be approaching Lakeview Dr in McAdenville.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 10:15 PM EST Tuesday the stage was 13.7 feet and rising
steadily.
- Action/Advisory Stage is 9.0 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise to a crest of
between 14.1 and 14.4 feet between midnight and 2am tonight.
