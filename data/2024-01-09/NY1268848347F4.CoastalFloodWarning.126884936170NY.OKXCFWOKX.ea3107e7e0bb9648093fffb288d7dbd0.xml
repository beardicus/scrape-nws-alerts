<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued January 09 at 4:49AM EST until January 10 at 10:00AM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM TO 10 AM EST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...2 to 2 1/2 feet of inundation above ground level
expected in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline
with the Wednesday morning high tide.
* WHERE...Southern Queens County.
* WHEN...From 4 AM to 10 AM EST Wednesday.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Moderate flooding of vulnerable areas
near the waterfront and shoreline, particularly Wednesday
morning. Expect 2 to 2 1/2 ft of inundation above ground level
in low lying, vulnerable areas. This will result in numerous
road closures and cause widespread flooding of low lying
property including parking lots, parks, lawns and
homes/businesses with basements near the waterfront. Vehicles
parked in vulnerable areas near the waterfront will likely
become flooded. Flooding will also extend inland from the
waterfront along tidal rivers and bays.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...Large breaking waves of 10 to 15 ft along
the oceanfront will result in scattered dune erosion and
localized overwashes. Localized flooding of roadways and
vulnerable structures behind protective dunes is possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Peak surge of 4 to 5 ft will likely be
between times of high tide this evening and Wednesday
morning. The timing of an offshore windshift before the time
of high tide Wednesday morning is expected to keep the threat
for major flood thresholds (3 ft of inundation above ground)
to be reached low and localized. Surge guidance trends will be
monitor and forecast refined over the next 24 hours. In
addition, heavy rain during this evening high tide will
likely exacerbate urban and poor drainage flood issues for
coastal and shoreline roads.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
