<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 09 at 5:11AM EST until January 10 at 11:00AM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM THIS EVENING TO 11 AM
EST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow and mixed precipitation expected. Total snow and
sleet accumulations between 6 and 13 inches. Winds gusting as high
as 50 mph.
* WHERE...Southern Somerset and Southern Franklin Counties.
* WHEN...From 9 PM this evening to 11 AM EST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Significant snowfall and periods of heavy snowfall rates
will combine with low visibility to create very dangerous driving
conditions. Heavy, wet snow will cause weighted tree limbs of
conifers and leafed trees, leading to snapped branches. Strong,
gusty winds are expected with this snowstorm as well and will
contribute to additional power outages especially in downsloping
areas to the northeast of larger mountain features.
Snow will eventually change over to rain Wednesday morning, with a
period of sleet and/or freezing rain at transition which will cause
slushy roads and further degrade driving conditions. Plan on
delaying travel to allow time for road conditions to improve. The
hazardous conditions will impact the Wednesday morning commute.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road conditions can
be obtained by going to newengland511.org</instruction>
