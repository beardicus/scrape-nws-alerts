<description>...Moderate Snowfall and Breezy Winds Continues West This Afternoon
and Evening...
.Snow is steadily tapering off from west to east this afternoon,
with moderate to heavy snowfall still falling over the eastern half
of the area this afternoon. Snowfall accumulations of 6 to 12 inches
have been reported over much of central and southern Iowa, with
slightly lower accumulations of 2 to 4 inches over far northern
Iowa. Additional accumulations of 1 to 2 inches are expected over
the eastern portions of the forecast area, with snow mostly
finished up further north and west. Snow will continue in the
eastern portions of Iowa through the rest of the afternoon before
diminishing this evening.
Wind gusts of 35 to 45 mph are prolonging the travel impacts
throughout the area, as blowing snow causes reduced visibility and
snow recollecting on roadways. The most hazardous travel still
resides in the eastern portions of the state, where falling snow and
gusty winds are creating low visibility on already poor roadways.
Further west, road conditions have begun to improve, but blowing and
drifting snow will continue to impact travel through the rest of the
afternoon. Stay off roads if you can, especially in eastern Iowa,
and if you must be out, use extra caution. Winds will diminish
through the evening.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM CST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Blowing snow continues through the afternoon. Winds
gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...North Central Iowa.
* WHEN...From now to 6 PM CST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slick road conditions. Patchy blowing snow
will reduce visibility, perhaps significantly at times.
Hazardous travel conditions possible during the evening
commute.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
For the latest travel conditions, check the Iowa 511 app,
www.511ia.org, or dial 511.</instruction>
