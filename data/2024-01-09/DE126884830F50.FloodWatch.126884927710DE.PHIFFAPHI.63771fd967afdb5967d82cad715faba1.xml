Delaware Beaches, Inland Sussex, Kent and New Castle, northeast
Maryland, including the following areas, Caroline, Kent MD, Queen
Annes and Talbot, New Jersey, including the following areas,

* WHEN...From 1 PM EST this afternoon through Wednesday afternoon.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rainfall of 1 to 3 inches possible later today and tonight,
with the heaviest rain falling later this afternoon and this
evening. The ground remains very saturated following multiple
rounds of heavy rainfall over the last month. A period of
higher hourly rainfall rates is possible tonight which would
enhance the potential for flooding, particularly in the urban
areas. Tidal inundation combined with runoff in coastal areas
may significantly elevate the flood risk, especially if
occurring during times of high tide.
