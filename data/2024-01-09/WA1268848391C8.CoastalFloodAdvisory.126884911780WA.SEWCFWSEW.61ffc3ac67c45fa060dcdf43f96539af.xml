<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM PST THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Minor coastal flooding.Inundation of 1 to 2 feet above
ground level is possible along shorelines and low-lying coastal
areas.
* WHERE...Western Whatcom County and Western Skagit County zones.
* WHEN...Until 4 PM PST this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Minor coastal flooding due to tidal overflow is
expected around high tide. This may lead to flooding of
parking lots, parks, and roads, with only isolated road
closures expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Strong low pressure continues to move just
north of the region today, which, when combined with strong
onshore flow will enhance the threat for coastal flooding today.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inundation above ground level refers to the height above the Mean
Higher High Water (MHHW) level.</instruction>
