<headline>Blizzard Warning issued January 09 at 2:58AM PST until January 10 at 4:00PM PST by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...BLIZZARD CONDITIONS EXPECTED FOR THE CASCADE PASSES AND ABOVE
TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY...
.OVERVIEW...The heaviest snow so far this season is on its way to
the Cascades after a strong cold front sweeps across the Pacific
Northwest tonight, ushering in much colder air and more
seasonable snow levels for Tuesday. Strong and deep onshore flow
will lead to periods of heavy snow, strong winds, and near zero
visibility for the Cascades, especially for exposed areas above
3000 feet. This has prompted us to issue a rare Blizzard Warning
for the Cascade passes and above, with Winter Storm Warnings
extending as low as 1500 to 2000 feet in the Cascade foothills.
By the time snow showers decrease Wednesday, elevations 3000 feet
and above will likely be measuring their snow in feet, rather
than inches.
...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM PST WEDNESDAY
ABOVE 3000 FEET...
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM PST
WEDNESDAY ABOVE 1500 FEET...
* WHAT...Dangerous blizzard conditions expected. Heavy snow and
strong winds will lead to white-out conditions at times. Snow
accumulations of 1 to 4 feet expected, heaviest above 3000
feet in elevation. Southwest to west winds will gust as high
as 55 mph at pass level and as high as 75 mph for the higher
ski resort elevations.
* WHERE...South Washington Cascades and North Oregon Cascades.
Winter Storm Warning in effect above 1500 feet, with Blizzard
Warnings in effect above 3000 feet.
* WHEN...Until 4 PM PST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...The combination of heavy snow and strong winds will
occasionally result in white-out conditions Tuesday through
Wednesday. Poor visibility and rapid snow accumulation of up
to 2 inches per hour will result in dangerous conditions for
even the most experienced of drivers Tuesday, Tuesday night,
and into Wednesday. Strong winds and heavy snow will likely
bring down tree limbs, leading to power outages. Increasingly
cold and windy conditions will make the outdoors hazardous for
the unprepared.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...After a period where snow levels are well
above the Cascade passes Monday night, snow levels will
plummet to around 1500 to 2000 feet by midday Tuesday,
remaining around 1500 feet through Wednesday.</description>
