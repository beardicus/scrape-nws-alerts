<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 09 at 3:25AM CST until January 10 at 6:00AM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Heavy Snow &amp; Hazardous Travel Today &amp; Tonight...
.Overnight bands of snow have provided 2 to 4 inches of snow
accumulations in spots and resulted in slippery to hazardous snow
covered roads. This heavy snow will continue through the morning
commute as increased snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches likely
across parts of northeast Iowa and southwest into central
Wisconsin. Morning commute motorists should exercise caution
especially along and south of Interstate 90.
Heavy snow persists this afternoon and evening, gradually
shifting east of the Mississippi River into central Wisconsin
tonight. The bulk of the accumulating snow will exit into eastern
Wisconsin by midnight tonight. Highest overall storm total
accumulations of 9 to 12 inches from northeast Iowa into southwest
and central Wisconsin may result in downed trees and power
outages.
In addition, northwest winds will increase with gusts 30 to
40 mph at times this afternoon through tonight. As a result,
blowing and drifting snow may rapidly reduce visibilities and
driving conditions especially along unsheltered areas and
ridgetops.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM CST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Snow, with additional accumulations of 2 to 5 inches.
Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of southeast Minnesota and central and west
central Wisconsin.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM CST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Patchy blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute.</description>
