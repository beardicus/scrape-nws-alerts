<headline>Flood Advisory issued January 09 at 8:56PM EST until January 10 at 1:33PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 245 AM EST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Nuisance flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of piedmont North Carolina, including the
following county, Rowan.
* WHEN...Until 245 AM EST.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks,
greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and
parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.
A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 846 PM EST, Heavy rainfall has ended across Rowan County
and the resultant flash flooding threat has ended.  However,
larger streams remain elevated and above bankfull or
Action/Advisory Stage following storm-total rainfall of 2-3
inches, including Grants Creek, N Second Creek, Third Creek,
and Fourth Creek.  These high flows are causing nuisance
flooding of adjacent low-lying areas including farmland and
woodland.
The streamgauges on N Second Creek above Statesville Blvd (US
70) and on Grants Creek at Rowan Mill Rd indicate these
streams are cresting and will gradually fall back below
bankfull over the next several hours.  A Flood Advisory has
been issued to highlight lingering lowland flooding concerns
and will continue until the streams recede back below
critical levels.
- Some locations that may experience nuisance flooding
include...
Salisbury, China Grove, Spencer, Landis, Cooleemee,
Cleveland, Woodleaf and Mount Ulla.

<instruction>Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
