eastern Iowa and southern Wisconsin with visibilities reduced to
1/4 mile at times. Winds were increasing, now gusting 30 to 35
mph. 4 to 8 inches of snow has fallen across southwest Wisconsin
and northeast Iowa. Another 3 to 4 inches can be expected this

Crosse Wisconsin, to Charles City Iowa. The snow diminish from

Wind gusts in the 30 to 40 mph range are expected south of
Interstate 90 complicating snow removal due to drifting and
causing travel headaches. Highest overall storm total
accumulations of 9 to 12 inches are expected from northeast Iowa
into southwest Wisconsin. Sporadic downed trees and power outages
are also possible there.
