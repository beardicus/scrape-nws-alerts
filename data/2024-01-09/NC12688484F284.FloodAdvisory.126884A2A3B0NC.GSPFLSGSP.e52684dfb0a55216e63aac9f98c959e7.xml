<headline>Flood Advisory issued January 09 at 3:41PM EST until January 11 at 10:00AM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has issued
a Flood Advisory for the following rivers in North Carolina...
French Broad River Near Hot Springs affecting Madison County.
.Heavy rain has ended across Madison County.  However, storm-total
rainfall of 2-3.5 inches occurred across the county with more
significant rainfall of 6-7 inches occurring in the headwaters of
the French Broad River.  Therefore, very high local and upstream
flows are causing significant rises along the French Broad River
with nuisance to Minor flooding along the river from Marshall to Hot
Springs underway.  This will result in common, nuisance flooding of
low-lying areas adjacent to the French Broad River.  Residents are
advised to move vulnerable property to higher ground and stay
up-to-date by monitoring the latest river levels and forecasts.
