<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued January 09 at 11:16AM EST until January 09 at 5:00PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
Burke County in western North Carolina...
McDowell County in western North Carolina...
* Until 500 PM EST.
* At 1116 AM EST, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated
thunderstorms producing heavy rain across the warned area. Between
3 and 4 inches of rain have fallen since earlier this morning.
Additional rainfall amounts of 2 to 3 inches are possible in the
warned area. Onset flash flooding is developing and significant
flash flooding is expected to begin shortly.  This will be a
prolonged event with new areas of flash flooding developing
throughout the afternoon hours.  Significant rises and adjacent
flooding of the upper Catawba River and the North Fork Catawba
River will continue to develop this afternoon.  Expect significant
flows along smaller streams, including Buck Creek, Toms Creek, and
North Muddy Creek, where flash flooding is already developing.
Please seek higher ground immediately and stay away from flooded
roads.  Extreme caution while traveling is advised.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms
producing flash flooding.
SOURCE...Radar and automated gauges.
IMPACT...Life threatening flash flooding of creeks and streams,
low-lying areas, urban areas, highways, streets and
underpasses.  Significant inundation of low-water
crossings and several secondary roads is likely.
Culvert and road washouts are possible.  Campgrounds
may experience significant flooding, capable of
sweeping away campers and RVs.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR AND GAUGE INDICATED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>Heavy rain is increasing the risk of landslides, especially in areas
where slides have occurred in the past. Be especially alert if you
are near a stream, especially at the base of a mountain or in a
cove. Watch for loose-moving soil and rocks or a sudden increase in
streamflow. Leave the area quickly if this is observed. When driving
along roads where the terrain is steep or rocky, watch and listen
for falling rocks, mud, trees and other debris.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
