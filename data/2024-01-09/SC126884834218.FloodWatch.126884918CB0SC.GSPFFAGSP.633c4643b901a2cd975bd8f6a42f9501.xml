<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of northeast Georgia, including the following
areas, Habersham, Rabun and Stephens, western North Carolina,
including the following areas, Eastern Polk, Greater Rutherford,

* WHEN...Through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A powerful low pressure system will spread heavy rain across
the region through this afternoon. Additional rainfall
amounts of 3 to 4 inches are expected throughout, while
locations in the southern-most parts of the North Carolina
mountains near the South Carolina border could see 6 inches.
The threat of flash flooding has increased given the recent
rainfall in this area.

<instruction>A Flood Watch for flash flooding means there is a potential for
rapid onset flooding based on current forecasts. Flash flooding is a
very dangerous situation and may impact areas that do not typically
flood. Please monitor the latest forecasts and be prepared to take
action quickly should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.
Rainfall of more than five inches in similar storms has been
associated with an increased risk of landslides and rockslides. If
you live on a mountainside or in a cove at the base of a mountain,
especially near a stream, be ready to leave in advance of the storm
or as quickly as possible should rising water, moving earth, or
rocks threaten. Consider postponing travel along mountain roads
during periods of heavy rainfall.</instruction>
