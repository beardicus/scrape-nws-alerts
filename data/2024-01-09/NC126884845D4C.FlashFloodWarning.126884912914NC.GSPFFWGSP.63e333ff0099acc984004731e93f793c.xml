FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>Heavy rain is increasing the risk of landslides, especially in areas
where slides have occurred in the past. Be especially alert if you
are near a stream, especially at the base of a mountain or in a
cove. Watch for loose-moving soil and rocks or a sudden increase in
streamflow. Leave the area quickly if this is observed. When driving
along roads where the terrain is steep or rocky, watch and listen
for falling rocks, mud, trees and other debris.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
