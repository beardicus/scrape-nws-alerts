<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 09 at 5:11AM EST until January 10 at 7:00AM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 5 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO 7 AM
EST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow and mixed precipitation expected. Total snow
accumulations between 6 and 17 inches and ice accumulations around
a light glaze.
* WHERE...Southern Coos County.
* WHEN...From 5 PM this afternoon to 7 AM EST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Significant snowfall and periods of heavy snowfall rates
will combine with low visibility to create very dangerous driving
conditions. Heavy, wet snow will cause weighted tree limbs of
conifers and leafed trees, leading to snapped branches. Snow will
change over to rain, with a period of sleet and/or freezing rain
at transition which will cause slushy roads and further degrade
driving conditions. Plan on delaying travel to allow time for road
conditions to improve. The hazardous conditions will impact the
Wednesday morning commute.
Winds are expected to become strong and gusty as snow transitions to
rain. The combination of fallen snow clinging to branches and power
lines and increasing winds will likely lead to additional power
outages.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Significant snowfall accumulations are
expected to be mainly at higher elevations and in the eastern half
of the county.</description>
