<headline>Coastal Flood Warning issued January 09 at 5:59AM PST until January 09 at 4:00PM PST by NWS Seattle</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM PST THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Significant coastal flooding. Inundation of 2 to 3 feet
above ground level is possible along shorelines and low-lying
coastal area.
* WHERE...San Juan County zone.
* WHEN...Until 4 PM PST this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Significant coastal flooding due to high tides and
storm surge is expected. This is expected to lead to numerous
road closures. Low lying property including homes, businesses,
and some critical infrastructure may be inundated. Shoreline
erosion or damage may occur.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Strong low pressure continues to move just
north of the region today, which, when combined with strong
onshore flow will enhance the threat for coastal flooding today.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Inundation above ground level refers to the height above the Mean
Higher High Water (MHHW) level.</instruction>
