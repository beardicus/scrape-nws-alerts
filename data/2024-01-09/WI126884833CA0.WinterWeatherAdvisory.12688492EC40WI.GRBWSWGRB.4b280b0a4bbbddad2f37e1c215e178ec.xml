<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 09 at 3:20AM CST until January 10 at 6:00AM CST by NWS GreenBay</headline>
<description>...HEAVY SNOW AND STRONG WINDS EXPECTED TODAY INTO TONIGHT...
.A strong winter system will move north into the Great Lakes.
Areas of freezing drizzle will precede the snow, resulting
in icy roads, especially over northern Wisconsin. Light snow will
continue to overspread the region this morning. The snow should
remain light in most areas through early afternoon, then become
moderate to heavy later this afternoon into early this evening. The
bulk of the accumulating snow will fall late this afternoon and
evening. Wind gusts from the northeast to north will also increase
to 30 to 40 mph during the late afternoon into this evening,
reducing visibility and resulting in patchy blowing and drifting
snow in open areas. The greatest accumulations are expected in the
eastern Fox Valley and lakeshore areas, where some lake enhancement
is anticipated. Hazardous travel conditions will develop, with the
worst conditions occurring during the afternoon and early evening.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM CST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation. Additional snow accumulations between
2 and 4 inches. Ice accumulations less than a tenth of an inch.
Winds gusting as high as 35 mph will create patchy blowing snow
and low visibilities for motorists.
* WHERE...Marathon, Langlade, Florence, Forest, and Northern
Marinette County Counties.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM CST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the Tuesday morning and evening commutes.</description>
