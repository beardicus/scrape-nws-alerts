<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM TO 10 PM PST
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Snow. Snow accumulations between 1 and 4 inches, with up to
6 inches in foothill locations above 5000 feet. Winds gusting
40-55 mph, with gusts 60-75 mph in wind prone areas, including

* WHERE...In California, Surprise Valley California. In Nevada,
Northern Washoe County and Greater Reno-Carson City-Minden Area.
* WHEN...From 4 AM to 10 PM PST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the Wednesday evening commute. Strong
winds could cause damage to trees and power lines.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...This event will be similar to the event
observed this past Saturday. Enhanced snow bands accompanying a
cold front will bring quick, heavy snowfall in a short period.
With this band expected to pass through during the peak
school/work commute time, major travel disruptions are possible.
Very cold temperatures behind the front may lead to flash freezes
on roadways and prolonged hazardous travel conditions into the
Thursday morning commute.</description>
