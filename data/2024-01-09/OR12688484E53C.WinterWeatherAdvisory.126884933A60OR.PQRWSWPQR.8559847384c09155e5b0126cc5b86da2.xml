<description>...BLIZZARD CONDITIONS EXPECTED FOR THE CASCADE PASSES AND ABOVE
THROUGH WEDNESDAY...
.OVERVIEW...The heaviest snow so far this season is on its way to
the Cascades after a strong cold front sweeps across the Pacific
Northwest tonight, ushering in much colder air and more
seasonable snow levels for Tuesday. Strong and deep onshore flow
will lead to periods of heavy snow, strong winds, and near zero
visibility for the Cascades, especially for exposed areas above
3000 feet. This has prompted us to issue a rare Blizzard Warning
for the Cascade passes and above, with Winter Storm Warnings
extending as low as 1500 to 2000 feet in the Cascade foothills.
By the time snow showers decrease Wednesday, elevations 3000 feet
and above will likely be measuring their snow in feet, rather
than inches.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 10 PM THIS EVENING TO
6 AM PST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 3
inches.
* WHERE...In Oregon, Lower Columbia. In Washington, I-5 Corridor
in Cowlitz County and Greater Vancouver Area.
* WHEN...From 10 PM this evening to 6 AM PST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Greatest snow accumulations are expected north
and east of Vancouver, with around an inch of slushy
accumulation also possible in the Vancouver area through early
Wednesday morning.</description>
