<description>...ICE WILL LIKELY ACCUMULATE ON THE MISSOURI RIVER IN THE
BISMARCK/MANDAN AREA...
Recent cold weather has started producing small sheets of ice moving
through the Bismarck/Mandan area on the Missouri River. Even colder
weather beginning late Wednesday, and lasting well into the third
full week of January, will increase the production of ice on the
river. Currently, there is significant open water south of Bismarck.
However, the ice sheets traditionally get caught in the Missouri
River bends near the University of Mary. As the sheets of ice
accumulate, they substantially restrict flow in the river and often
cause a rapid rise in water levels near the ice. Historically, this
rise has been between 5 and 7 feet. The current water level at the
Bismarck gage on the Missouri River is at 4.9 feet. As ice
accumulates, a rapid rise to a water level between 9.5 and 12 feet
is likely.
Once the ice starts accumulating south of Bismarck, water levels
often rise to their maximum level in less than 24 hours.  Residents
near the river should be watchful of rapidly changing conditions and
report any problematic high water to your local emergency manager.</description>
