<description>...Wintry Mix of Precipitation Moving in Sunday Night...
.A powerful storm system will bring widespread precipitation to the
region Sunday night and Monday. Initially, temperatures will be in
the 20s, with a wintry mix of freezing rain and snow north of
where the rain occurs. The precipitation type will hinge on what
the surface temperatures are and accumulations will depend on how
long the temperatures remain below freezing. Winds will also
increase from the east, thus impacts may be elevated due to trees
and powerlines being coated with ice. Areas near and north of I94
have the greatest potential to see a quarter of an inch or more
of ice accumulation. The precipitations will switch to rain, then
snow with some light snow accumulations possible.
...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH
MONDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation possible. Total snow
accumulations of up to one inch and ice accumulations of two
tenths to four tenths of an inch possible. Winds could gust as
high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Taylor and Clark Counties.
* WHEN...From late Sunday night through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Power outages and tree damage are likely due to the
ice. Travel could be nearly impossible. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning commute.</description>
