<description>...Heavy Rainfall Possible East Coast Areas On Saturday...
A frontal boundary will move northward into South Florida on
Saturday, as a mid level trough moves eastward from the Gulf of
Mexico into the Florida Peninsula. This will allow for the
steering flow to become southwest over South Florida as the
surface winds will remain north northeast due to high pressure
over the Gulf of Mexico. This in turn will allow for a low level
trough to develop over the eastern areas of South Florida.
At the same time, the southwest steering flow will allow for
deeper tropical moisture to work northeast from the the Florida
Straits into the eastern areas of South Florida. PWAT values are
forecast to increase to 2 to 2.2 inches over the eastern areas of
the region which is near the maximum PWAT values for this time of
year.
Therefore, any showers or thunderstorms that do develop on
over the eastern areas of South Florida on Saturday will be
capable of producing heavy rainfall. At this time, it looks like
rainfall amounts will be between 1 to 2 inches but there could be
higher amounts where any showers or thunderstorm train over the
same area.
Will continue to monitor the latest model forecast on the
potential of heavy rainfall for Saturday.</description>
