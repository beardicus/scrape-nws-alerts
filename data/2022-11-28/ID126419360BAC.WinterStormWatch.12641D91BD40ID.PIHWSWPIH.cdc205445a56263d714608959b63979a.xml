night.

including but not limited to Banner Summit, Stanley, Galena
Summit, Ketchum, and Sun Valley.
* WHEN...From late Wednesday morning through early Friday morning.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult, especially during the
Thursday morning and Thursday evening commutes. Wind gusts in
excess of 30 MPH near mountain highway passes as well as peaks
and ridgelines may also result in areas of blowing and drifting
snow and dangerous conditions in the backcountry.</description>
