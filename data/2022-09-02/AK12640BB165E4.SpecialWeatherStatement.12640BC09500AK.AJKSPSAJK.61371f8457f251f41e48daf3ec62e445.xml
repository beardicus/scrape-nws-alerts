<headline>Special Weather Statement issued September 02 at 12:49PM AKDT  by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...Northern Inner Channel rivers and streams rising to near bankfull
Saturday...
Heavy rain from the Atmospheric River moving into the Haines,
Skagway and Juneau areas will cause many area rivers and streams to
rapidly rise to near bankfull late Friday night into Saturday.
Around 1 to 3 inches of rainfall is expected through Saturday across
the area with the heaviest rainfall expected Friday night and
Saturday. Flooding potential remains low, but any substantial
changes in rainfall rate or totals could result in higher or lower
observed river levels.
The most significant impacts are expected along the Chilkat River
near Haines and Klukwan and the Taiya River near Skagway where water
levels are expected to rise to bankful conditions by Saturday
afternoon. Near Juneau, Jordan Creek has the best potential to reach
bankfull stage, but is expected to stay below it. All area rivers
and streams are expected to be running higher then usual due to the
rainfall this weekend. Recreators in and around other area rivers
and streams should be prepared for rising water for the holiday
weekend.</description>
