<description>...HEAVY RAIN INTO THE WEEKEND FOR GULF COAST AND ICY STRAIT
CORRIDOR...
An atmospheric river has been giving moderate to heavy rain to parts
of the northern half of Southeast Alaska. Heavy rain started late
Wednesday night near Yakutat, and is expected to slide over the Icy
Strait corridor and central gulf coast late Friday.
So far, the Yakutat airport has received well over 5 inches of rain
from  Wednesday night through Friday morning, and another 2 to 3
inches of rain is expected through Saturday. The heaviest rainfall
is expected to last through Saturday morning before diminishing
Saturday afternoon. The Situk River has been rising rapidly from the
heavy rain, but is still well below bankfull conditions as of Friday
morning. The Situk, and other rivers near Yakutat, are expected to
remain within their banks, but will still be running higher then
usual.
The Northern Inner Channels, including the Icy Strait corridor, will
see somewhat lesser amounts ranging from 2 to 5 inches of rainfall,
with the highest amounts from Cross Sound to Juneau. This heavier
rainfall is mainly expected from Friday evening through Saturday
morning. There are some uncertainties in the total rainfall forecast
as terrain could cause some local areas to get more or less total
rainfall. Northern inner channel rivers and streams are expected to
rise as a result of this rainfall. At this time, flood potential is
low, but rivers may reach, or get near, bankfull conditions. People
who recreate along rivers  and streams across the northern panhandle
should remain alert. For any updated information on this evolving
event visit weather.gov/juneau.</description>
