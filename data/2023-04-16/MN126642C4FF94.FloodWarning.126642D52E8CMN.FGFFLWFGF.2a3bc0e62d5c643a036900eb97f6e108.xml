<headline>Flood Warning issued April 16 at 12:09PM CDT until further notice by NWS Eastern ND and Grand Forks</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Grand Forks ND has issued a Flood
Warning for the following rivers in North Dakota...Minnesota...
Red River of the North at Pembina affecting Pembina and Kittson
Counties.
Red River of the North at Drayton affecting Pembina, Walsh,
Kittson and Marshall Counties.
.Snowmelt continues across the Red River basin, with meltwater slower
to reach the river system in spots. Overall, river responses will
become more widespread in the coming days, even with temperatures
trending toward normal to below normal through early next week as
snowpack temperatures are nearing freezing across much of the basin.
The rate of rise and ultimate crest remains uncertain due to
forecast temperatures, ongoing snowmelt runoff, and additional
precipitation chances expected toward the middle of next week.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
