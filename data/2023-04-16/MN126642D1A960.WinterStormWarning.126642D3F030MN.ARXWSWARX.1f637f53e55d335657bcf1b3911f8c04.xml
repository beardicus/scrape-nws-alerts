<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued April 16 at 7:08PM CDT until April 17 at 10:00AM CDT by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Temporary Decrease In The Snow Early This Evening...
.The snow has temporarily diminished in intensity across much of
the area early this evening. However, another band of heavy snow
is expected to develop after dark across portions of north-central
into western Wisconsin. Rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour can be
expected again in the next band of heavy snow. This will be enough
for rapid accumulation to occur and for roads to become snow
covered and slippery. In addition, the heavy, wet snow combined
with gusty winds could cause some power outages and tree damage to
occur.
Snowfall reports along the Mississippi River under the heavy snow
band from the afternoon indicate amounts of 3 to 8 inches fell. As
more snow falls overnight, we may lose a few inches due to
melting and compaction, however, storm totals of 6 to 12 inches
with locally higher amounts are expected through Monday morning.
Travel tonight and into Monday will be significant hampered and
some roads may be impassable until plowed.
In addition, strong winds of 35 to 45 mph will further reduce
visibilities during the times of heavier snow and a mix of
freezing rain is possible north of U.S. Highway 10 in central
Wisconsin this evening before transitioning to all snow.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM CDT
MONDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 3 to 9
inches. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of southeast Minnesota and southwest and west
central Wisconsin.
* WHEN...Until 10 AM CDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning commute.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
