<description>...FLOOD WARNING FOR SNOWMELT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM CDT/NOON
MDT/ MONDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by snowmelt will continue.
* WHERE...Central and portions of western North Dakota, including
the James River Valley.
* WHEN...Until 100 PM CDT Monday /noon MDT Monday/.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring. Numerous roads
remain closed due to flooding.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1230 PM CDT /1130 AM MDT/, Snowpack has been soaking into
the ground and the upper portions of soils are becoming
saturated. Areas that have appreciable snowpack remaining
will see additional runoff in the coming days as the ponding
water eventually makes its way through frozen culverts and
into the waterways. In the Prairie pothole region, ponds and
sloughs may see water rise enough to run over roads.
Throughout the warned area, county and township roads may
become covered in water due to high water and plugged
culverts. Mainly rural areas in the affected counties will be
affected, but towns and cities may also experience localized
flooding issues.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
