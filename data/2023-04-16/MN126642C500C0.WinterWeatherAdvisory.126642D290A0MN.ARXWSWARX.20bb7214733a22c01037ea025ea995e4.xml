<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued April 16 at 12:12PM CDT until April 17 at 1:00AM CDT by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Band of Heavy Snow Expected Tonight into Monday Morning...
.A very complex winter storm system impacts the region this
afternoon through Monday morning. Through Noon, temperatures have
fallen to freezing or below from around Rochester to west of
Charles City with light precipitation with freezing drizzle or
light snow. Although the observations are reporting freezing
drizzle, due to the warm pavement temperatures, pavement is likely
&quot;wet&quot;. Farther east, temperatures are milder in the mid 30s to
lower 40s. Here at the NWS on a ridgetop, at noon we were 34
degrees with sleet.
This afternoon, the snow will change to snow and increase in
intensity. During the nighttime hours, east of the Mississippi
River where snowfall rates in the heavy snow band will likely
exceed an inch per hour.
Data this morning continues to show good agreement with the heavy
snow east of the Mississippi River, especially from Taylor through
Clark, Jackson, Monroe, Juneau, parts of La Crossse and Vernon
counties and parts of Richland counties. Total snow amounts will
vary widely over short distances depending on how early the rain
changes to snow and where the band of snow sets up. Highest
amounts of 6 to 12 inches should fall in this north to south band
through Monday morning. Travel tonight and into Monday will be
significant hampered and some roads may be impassable until
plowed.
In addition, strong winds of 35 to 45 mph will further reduce
visibilities during the times of heavier snow and a mix of
freezing rain is possible north of Highway 10 in central
Wisconsin this evening before transitioning to all snow.
