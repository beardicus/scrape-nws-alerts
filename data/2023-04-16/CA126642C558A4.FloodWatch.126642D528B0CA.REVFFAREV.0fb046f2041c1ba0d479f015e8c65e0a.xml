<headline>Flood Watch issued April 16 at 12:37PM PDT  by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>.Warming temperatures this weekend are bringing renewed snowmelt and
streamflow rises, especially for snow covered terrain below about
7000 feet. Creeks that brought impacts this past week are likely to
be problematic again and potentially reach higher levels, especially
by late today.
...FLOOD WATCH FOR SNOWMELT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by snowmelt continues to be possible.
* WHERE...Portions of California and western Nevada, including the
following areas, in California, Greater Lake Tahoe Area,
Lassen-Eastern Plumas-Eastern Sierra Counties and Surprise Valley
California. In western Nevada, Greater Lake Tahoe Area, Greater
Reno-Carson City-Minden Area and Mineral and Southern Lyon
Counties.
* WHEN...Through Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...Creeks and streams will be running high and fast.
Low-water crossings may be flooded. Minor mainstem flooding along
the Susan River, Forks of the Carson River, and the East Walker
River below Bridgeport Reservoir cannot be ruled out. Anyone
participating in outdoor recreation this weekend should use
caution as water will be running high, fast, and potentially out
of banks for some creeks and streams. The water will be extremely
cold as well, quickly causing shock.
