<description>...A LINE OF HEAVY SNOW WILL AFFECT EASTERN AND CENTRAL AITKIN
COUNTY...
At 646 PM CDT, an area of heavy snow showers were along a line
extending from Jacobson to McGrath, and moving west at 5 mph.
Visibilities of 1/4 mile or less, wind gusts up to 40 mph, and rapid
snow accumulation on roads are expected with this area of heavy snow
showers.
Other locations impacted by this area of heavy snow showers include
Arthyde, Flowage Lake, Ball Bluff, Sheshebee, Lawler, Dads Corner,
Savanna Portage State Park, Balsam, Rice Lake Wildlife Refuge and
Kimberly.
Conditions will deteriorate rapidly within this line of heavy
snowfall. Be prepared for wet and slushy snow quickly accumulating
on the roadways. Slow down, allow extra following and stopping
distance between you and the vehicle in front of you, and allow
extra time to reach your destination.</description>
