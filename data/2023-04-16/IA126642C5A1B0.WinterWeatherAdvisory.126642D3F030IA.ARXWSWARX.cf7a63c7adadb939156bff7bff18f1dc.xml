<description>...Band of Heavy, Wet Snow Expected into Monday Morning...
.A band of heavy, wet snow continues to fall along and near the
Mississippi River. Accumulations in the band are occurring on
grassy surfaces with some pavement starting to become snow covered
as well. A few accumulations in the 3 to 5 inch range have already
been received. Look for the snow to continue in bands through the
night with rates of 1 to 2 inches common. The heavy, wet snow
combined with gusty winds could cause some power outages and tree
damage to occur.
We may lose a few inches of snow due to melting and compaction,
however 6 to 12 inches with locally higher amounts are expected
through Monday morning. Travel tonight and into Monday will be
significant hampered and some roads may be impassable until
plowed.
In addition, strong winds of 35 to 45 mph will further reduce
visibilities during the times of heavier snow and a mix of
freezing rain is possible north of U.S. Highway 10 in central
Wisconsin this evening before transitioning to all snow.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM CDT
MONDAY...
* WHAT...Snow. Additional snow accumulations of 2 to 4 inches.
Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Winneshiek, Allamakee, Fayette and Clayton Counties.
* WHEN...Until 10 AM CDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Patchy blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning commute.
