<description>...A SIGNIFICANT ROUND OF WINTRY PRECIPITATION EXPECTED TONIGHT INTO
MONDAY...
.Low pressure will strengthen over northeast Wisconsin today and
tonight, then begin to drift east into Michigan on Monday. Colder
air wrapping south on the western flank of the system will cause the
rain to change to a wintry mix over north-central and central
Wisconsin late today and this evening. Periods of heavy snow are
likely tonight into Monday. The snow will be mixed with some sleet
and freezing rain at times.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM THIS EVENING TO
1 PM CDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Rain changing to a wintry mix of sleet and freezing rain
late this afternoon or early this evening. Periods of heavy snow
tonight into Monday morning. Some sleet or freezing rain could be
mixed with the snow at times. Total snow accumulations between 5
and 10 inches. Locally higher amounts possible. Winds gusting as
high as 45 mph will result in some drifting of the snow.
* WHERE...Marathon, Portage, and Wood Counties.
* WHEN...From 7 PM this evening to 1 PM CDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous conditions
will impact the Monday morning commute. The wind combined with
heavy snow weighing down trees could bring down tree branches and
result in isolated power outages.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel during this period, drive with extreme caution.
Consider taking a winter storm kit along with you, including such
items as tire chains, booster cables, flashlight, shovel, blankets
and extra clothing. Also take water, a first aid kit, and anything
else that would help you survive in case you become stranded. Be
sure your vehicle has sufficient fuel before crossing open areas.</instruction>
