<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued April 16 at 3:39AM CDT until April 17 at 10:00AM CDT by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Band of Heavy Snow Expected Tonight into Monday Morning...
.A very complex winter storm system impacts the region this
afternoon through Monday morning. Snow develops this afternoon and
increases in intensity overnight along and east of the Mississippi
River where snowfall rates will likely exceed an inch per hour.
Initial snowfall accumulations this afternoon will be tempered by
melting, but as the sun sets and temperatures fall, rapid snow
accumulation is expected. Total snow amounts will vary widely over
short distances, but the highest amounts of 6 to 12 inches should
fall along a north to south band from southwest into central
Wisconsin by Monday morning. Travel tonight and into Monday will
be significant hampered and some roads may be impassable until
plowed.
In addition, strong winds of 35 to 45 mph will further reduce
visibilities during the times of heavier snow and a mix of
freezing rain is possible north of Highway 10 in central Wisconsin
this evening before transitioning to all snow.
...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM THIS EVENING TO 10 AM
CDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 6 to 12
inches. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of southeast Minnesota and central, north
central, southwest and west central Wisconsin.
* WHEN...From 7 PM this evening to 10 AM CDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Patchy blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions
will impact the Monday morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...There will be a very tight gradient in
snowfall amounts along the edges of the warning in southeast
Minnesota and far southwest Wisconsin. These areas may only see
a few inches of snow.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
