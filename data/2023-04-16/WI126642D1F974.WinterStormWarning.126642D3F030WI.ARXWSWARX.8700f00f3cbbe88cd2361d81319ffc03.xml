<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued April 16 at 9:13PM CDT until April 17 at 10:00AM CDT by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Next Heavy Snow Band Taking Shape...
.The next band of heavy snow was forming this evening from north-
central Wisconsin into parts of western Wisconsin, or roughly from
Taylor County south into portions of La Crosse and Monroe Counties.
Snowfall rates in this band are expected to be 1 to 2 inches per
hour which will cause rapid accumulations to occur and for roads
to become snow covered and slippery. In addition, the heavy, wet
snow combined with gusty winds could cause some power outages and
tree damage to occur.
Snowfall reports from the afternoon have been highly variable with
a wide range. Amounts of a couple of inches have been common for
parts of southeast Minnesota to as much as 10 inches across parts
of western Wisconsin. As more snow falls overnight, storm totals
could be a foot or more for portions of western Wisconsin. Travel
tonight into Monday morning is expected to be impacted with a
slower than normal morning commute possible.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM CDT
MONDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 3 to 9
inches. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Portions of southeast Minnesota and southwest and west
central Wisconsin.
* WHEN...Until 10 AM CDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning commute.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
