<description>...A SIGNIFICANT ROUND OF WINTRY PRECIPITATION EXPECTED TONIGHT INTO
MONDAY...
.Low pressure will strengthen over northeast Wisconsin today and
tonight, then begin to drift east into Michigan on Monday. Colder
air wrapping south on the western flank of the system will cause the
rain to change to a wintry mix over north-central and central
Wisconsin late today and this evening. Periods of heavy snow are
likely tonight into Monday. The snow will be mixed with some sleet
and freezing rain at times.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM THIS AFTERNOON
TO 7 PM CDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Rain changing to a wintry mix of sleet and freezing rain
this afternoon, then periods of heavy snow, sleet, and freezing
rain tonight and Monday. Total snow and sleet accumulations
between 4 and 9 inches along with some minor icing due to freezing
rain. Locally higher snow amounts possible in western Vilas and
Oneida counties. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph could result in
some drifting of the snow.
* WHERE...Lincoln, Oneida, and Vilas Counties.
* WHEN...From 4 PM this afternoon to 7 PM CDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous conditions
will impact the Monday morning and afternoon commutes. The wind
combined with heavy snow weighing down trees could bring down tree
branches and result in some power outages.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel during this period, drive with extreme caution.
Consider taking a winter storm kit along with you, including such
items as tire chains, booster cables, flashlight, shovel, blankets
and extra clothing. Also take water, a first aid kit, and anything
else that would help you survive in case you become stranded. Be
sure your vehicle has sufficient fuel before crossing open areas.</instruction>
