<description>...Foothills snowmelt may lead to localized flooding...
Warmer temperatures will increase snowmelt over area foothills,
and the higher hills of Big Horn and Sheridan counties. While this
round of warm temperatures will be shorter and less extreme than
what occurred last week, that event has primed the snow to melt
faster with subsequent warm periods. If you experienced problems
with snowmelt last week, be prepared for additional water issues
through Wednesday. A cold front late Monday night will cool
temperatures and slow snowmelt through Tuesday. However there
will be a lag in runoff working through the system that will
likely last into Wednesday.
A second concern, that is increasing in potential, is rain falling on
snow Tuesday into Tuesday evening. The most likely area for this to
occur will be over southern Big Horn and Sheridan county. Rain
falling on snow, even cold rain, can result in rapid melting of
snow and enhanced flooding concerns. Take any rain falling on snow
situation seriously.
Water flowing downhill and accumulating in low lying areas may result
in localized flooding. Expect increased flows on area creeks,
streams, and rivers. Small creeks and streams that originate in the
foothills may reach bankfull in some areas with minor flooding a
possibility. Water may accumulate near home foundations increasing
the chance of basement flooding. Plugged culverts, ditches, and
storm drains may result in water flowing over and possibly eroding
roadways in spots. Unpaved roads may suddenly thaw and become muddy
and impassable.
The severity of the impacts will depend on how quickly the snowpack
melts, how fast the ground thaws, and any precipitation.
While flooding is not imminent, if you have not already done so, now
is the time to move equipment and livestock out of low lying areas,
and away from waterways. Move any heavy accumulations of snow away
from structures and take steps to prevent water from making it into
basements. Unplug storm drains and culverts to give water a place to
go. Do not drive over flooded roadways as the roadbed may be washed
out.
Stay tuned to the forecast for the latest temperature and
precipitation trends, along with any warnings or advisories that may
be issued. Please report any flooding to local law enforcement and
have them relay the report to the National Weather Service.</description>
