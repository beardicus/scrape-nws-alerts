<description>...FREEZE WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM TO 8 AM CDT
MONDAY...
...WIND ADVISORY WILL EXPIRE AT 7 PM CDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Freeze Warning, sub-freezing temperatures as
low as 33 expected. For the Wind Advisory, northwest winds 25
to 30 mph with gusts up to 45 mph.
* WHERE...In Kansas, Atchison KS and Doniphan Counties. In
Missouri, Atchison MO and Holt Counties.
* WHEN...For the Freeze Warning, from 4 AM to 8 AM CDT Monday.
For the Wind Advisory, until 7 PM CDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Gusty winds could blow around unsecured objects.
Tree limbs could be blown down and a few power outages may
result. Frost and freeze conditions will kill crops, other
sensitive vegetation and possibly damage unprotected outdoor
plumbing.</description>
<instruction>Use extra caution when driving, especially if operating a high
profile vehicle. Secure outdoor objects.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.
A Freeze Warning means sub-freezing temperatures are imminent or
highly likely. These conditions will kill crops and other
sensitive vegetation.</instruction>
