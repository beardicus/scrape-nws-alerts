<headline>Blizzard Warning issued December 13 at 1:52AM MST until December 14 at 12:00AM MST by NWS Boulder</headline>
<description>...PLAINS BLIZZARD DEVELOPING BY TUESDAY MORNING...
.A strong winter storm system will produce blizzard conditions over
northeastern Colorado overnight through Tuesday. Strong winds are
expected to gust up to 60 mph. The heaviest snow is expected to be
on the plains east of Greeley and Denver, focusing toward the Akron,
Sterling, and possibly Fort Morgan areas.
If you are planning travel north or east of Denver Tuesday, you
should consider changing your plans to avoid travel. Travel will be
difficult to impossible and road closures are likely. Those with
outdoor livestock interests should prepare now for likely blizzard
conditions on Tuesday.  Continued cold and windy weather will
continue behind the storm Wednesday and Thursday.
...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT MST TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions expected. Total snow accumulations
between 2 and 6 inches. Winds gusting as high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...Agate and Limon.
* WHEN...Until Midnight MST tonight.
* IMPACTS...Visibility will be near zero at times resulting in white
out conditions. Travel will be treacherous and potentially
life-threatening. Road closures and impassable roads are likely.
Plan on slippery road conditions. Widespread blowing snow could
significantly reduce visibility.</description>
<instruction>Travel should be restricted to emergencies only. If you must travel,
have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded, stay with
your vehicle. The latest road conditions for Colorado can be
obtained by calling 5 1 1 or by going to www.cotrip.org.</instruction>
