<description>...Winter Storm Impacts Tonight Through Thursday...
A wintry mix will spread across central into north-central
Wisconsin this evening with multiple rounds of precipitation
persisting into Thursday. Icing, especially on elevated surfaces,
coupled with strong winds gusting to 35 to 45 mph, may result in
localized tree damage and power outages through Wednesday morning.
Snow or a wintry mix will diminish Wednesday afternoon before
another round of snow develops Wednesday night. Several inches of
snow are possible Wednesday night, especially across north-central
Wisconsin.
This forecast is very sensitive to temperatures, which will be
right near freezing. If temperatures warm a few degrees above
freezing, icing will be reduced.

TO 9 AM CST THURSDAY...
...WINTER STORM WATCH IS CANCELLED...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation transitioning to snow Wednesday night

* WHERE...Taylor and Clark Counties.
* WHEN...From 6 PM this evening to 9 AM CST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous
