<headline>Freeze Warning issued December 13 at 2:18PM PST until December 14 at 9:00AM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...FREEZE WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 2 AM TO 9 AM PST WEDNESDAY...
...AIR STAGNATION ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM WEDNESDAY
TO 4 AM PST SATURDAY...
...FREEZE WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH
THURSDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...For the Freeze Warning and Watch, sub-freezing
temperatures as low as 30 expected. For the Air Stagnation
Advisory, stagnant air is expected, which may lead to
deteriorating air quality expected.
* WHERE...For the Freeze Warning, South Central Oregon Coast from
Reedsport to Port Orford. For the Freeze Watch, the Coos County
coast from north of Reedsport to south of Bandon. For the Air
Stagnation Advisory, inland areas of Coos County including the
Coquille Valley.
* WHEN...For the Freeze Warning, from 2 AM to 9 AM PST
Wednesday. For the Air Stagnation Advisory, from 4 AM
Wednesday to 4 AM PST Saturday. For the Freeze Watch, from
late Wednesday night through Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Freeze conditions will kill crops, other sensitive
vegetation and possibly damage unprotected outdoor plumbing. Air
stagnation is likely to result in diminishing air quality with
time, especially in and near areas with significant sources of
air pollution. Diminished air quality is likely to cause health
issues for people with respiratory problems if precautions are
not taken.

<instruction>Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.
People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with diminished air quality. N95 masks are
effective at filtering out the majority of harmful air
particulates.
State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor
burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be
limited as much as possible. According to state air quality
agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants
close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with
your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
