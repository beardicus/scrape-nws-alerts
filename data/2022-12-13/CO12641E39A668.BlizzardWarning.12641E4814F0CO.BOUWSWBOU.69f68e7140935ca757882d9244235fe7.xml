<description>...PLAINS BLIZZARD TODAY THROUGH TONIGHT...
.A strong winter storm system will produce blizzard conditions over
northeastern Colorado today through tonight. Strong winds are
expected to gust up to 60 mph. The heaviest snow is expected to be
on the plains east of Greeley and Denver, focusing toward the Akron,
Sterling, Fort Morgan and Limon areas.
If you are planning travel northeast, east or southeast of Denver
today, you should consider changing your plans to avoid travel.
Travel will be difficult to impossible and road closures are likely.
Those with outdoor livestock interests should prepare now for
blizzard conditions. Continued cold and very windy weather will
continue behind the storm Wednesday into Thursday.
...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT MST TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions ongoing. Additional snow accumulations
between 4 and 8 inches. Winds gusting as high as 60 mph.
* WHERE...Briggsdale and northeast Weld County.
* WHEN...Until Midnight MST tonight.
* IMPACTS...Visibility will be near zero at times resulting in
whiteout conditions. Travel will be treacherous and potentially
life-threatening. Road closures and impassable roads are likely.
Strong winds will cause extensive drifting snow and may cause
minor damage and power outages. Strong winds will continue to
cause drifting snow in northeastern Colorado on Wednesday and
possibly into Thursday.</description>
<instruction>Prepare for blizzard conditions, road closures, and the possibility
of being stranded if you do travel. Travel only in the event of an
emergency and always take a winter survival kit with you. Include
such items as tire chains, booster cables, flashlight, shovel,
blankets and extra clothing. Also take water, a first aid kit, and
anything else that would help you survive in your car for an
extended time.</instruction>
