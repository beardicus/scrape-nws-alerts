<description>...WINTER STORM COULD BRING HEAVY SNOW, A WINTRY MIX, AND HAZARDOUS
TRAVEL TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY...
.A strong low pressure system will move across the Great Lakes
mid-week, spreading a wintry mix of snow, freezing rain and sleet
across the region tonight into Wednesday. The mixed precipitation
will turn to all snow over much of northern Wisconsin Wednesday
afternoon and evening, with periods of heavy snow expected Wednesday
night. East winds will also gust to 25 to 40 mph, which could
combine with heavy snow accumulations to cause tree and power line
damage. Sporadic power outages will be possible. Travel could become
hazardous due to the snow and ice. Some uncertainty remains on exact
precipitation type and amounts as temperatures will be near freezing.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM THIS EVENING
TO 6 AM CST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow and sleet
accumulations up to one inch and ice accumulations around one
tenth of an inch. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Waushara County.
* WHEN...From 6 PM this evening to 6 AM CST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will
likely become slick and hazardous. The strong winds and weight of
snow and ice on tree limbs may result in tree or power line
damage, resulting in sporadic power outages. Travel could be very
difficult. The hazardous conditions could impact the Wednesday
morning and evening commutes, and the Thursday morning commute.</description>
