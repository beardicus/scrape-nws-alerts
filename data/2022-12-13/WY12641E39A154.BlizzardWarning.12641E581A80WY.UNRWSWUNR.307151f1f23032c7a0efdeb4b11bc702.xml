<headline>Blizzard Warning issued December 13 at 5:29AM MST until December 15 at 5:00AM MST by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>...POTENT WINTER STORM THROUGH MIDWEEK...
.A strong winter storm will impact the region through Wednesday
night, with heavy snow, wind, and blizzard conditions for the
northeast Wyoming and western South Dakota plains. Six inches or
more of snow is expected for almost all of the area, with a good
portion of far northeast Wyoming and the western South Dakota
plains having very high potential for over a foot of snow.
Favored locations across the northern Black Hills area will
likely receive over 2 feet of snow. In addition, strong northwest
winds gusting 40 to over 50 mph at times on the plains, will
support blizzard conditions at times. Further east across south
central South Dakota, there will be a wintry mix of precipitation
this morning, eventually changing over to all snow in the
afternoon. Some areas of freezing rain this morning will produce
icy conditions. Some uncertainty still remains with respect to
the exact track, duration, and intensity of the storm over the
next couple of days, which will impact snow amounts and winds.
Listen to NOAA Weather Radio or your local media for the latest
updates on this storm.
