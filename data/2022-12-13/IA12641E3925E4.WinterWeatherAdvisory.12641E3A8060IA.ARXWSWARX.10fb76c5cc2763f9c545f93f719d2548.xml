<description>...Winter Storm Impacts Tonight Through Thursday..
.A strong winter storm affects parts of southeast Minnesota,
northeast Iowa, and northern Wisconsin between this morning and
Thursday. Initial impacts affect parts of southeast Minnesota and
northeast Iowa this morning with the possibility of freezing rain.
In northern Wisconsin, a wintry mix of freezing rain and snow
arrives tonight. By Wednesday morning, a quarter inch of ice may
coat roadways, trees, and power lines in these areas. Travel will
likely be hazardous. This ice, coupled with strong winds gusting
to 35 to 45 mph, may result in localized tree damage and power
outages. Snow sets in by Wednesday morning with a prolonged light
to moderate snowfall through Thursday.
This forecast is very sensitive to temperatures, which will be
right near freezing. If temperatures warm a few degrees above
freezing, icing will be reduced.
