<headline>Blizzard Warning issued December 13 at 3:04AM MST until December 15 at 5:00AM MST by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>...POTENT WINTER STORM THROUGH MIDWEEK...
.A strong winter storm will impact the region through Wednesday
night, with heavy snow, wind, and blizzard conditions for the
northeast Wyoming and western South Dakota plains. Six inches or
more of snow is expected for almost all of the area, with a good
portion of far northeast Wyoming and the western South Dakota
plains having very high potential for over a foot of snow.
Favored locations across the northern Black Hills area will
likely receive over 2 feet of snow. In addition, strong northwest
winds gusting 40 to over 50 mph at times on the plains, will
support blizzard conditions at times. Further east across south
central South Dakota, there will be a wintry mix of precipitation
this morning, eventually changing over to all snow in the
afternoon. Some areas of freezing rain this morning will produce
icy conditions. Some uncertainty still remains with respect to the
exact track, duration, and intensity of the storm over the next
couple of days, which will impact snow amounts and winds. Listen
to NOAA Weather Radio or your local media for the latest updates
on this storm.
...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 AM MST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions. Total snow accumulations of 10 to 22
inches in most areas. Total accumulations of 5 to 10 inches
across the Custer County plains. Winds gusting as high as 60
mph on the plains.
* WHERE...The Custer County Plains, the Pennington County
Plains, the Sturgis/Piedmont Foot Hills and the Southern Meade
County Plains.
* WHEN...Until 5 AM MST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible.
Widespread blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility.
Strong winds could cause tree damage.</description>
<instruction>A Blizzard Warning means severe winter weather conditions are
expected or occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds
and poor visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout
conditions, making travel extremely dangerous. Travel should be
restricted to emergencies only. If you must travel, have a winter
survival kit with you. If you get stranded, stay with your
vehicle.
Road conditions are available on your smartphone from the
5 1 1 app for your state.</instruction>
