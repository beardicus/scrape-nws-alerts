<headline>Air Stagnation Advisory issued December 13 at 8:49AM PST until December 17 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...AIR STAGNATION ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 4 AM WEDNESDAY
TO 4 AM PST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Stagnant air is expected, which may lead to
deteriorating air quality expected.
* WHERE...Inland areas of Coos and Curry County, especially for
valley locations like the Coquille Valley.
* WHEN...4 AM Wednesday to 4 AM PST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Air stagnation is likely to result in diminishing air
quality with time, especially in and near areas with significant
sources of air pollution. Diminished air quality is likely to
cause health issues for people with respiratory problems if
precautions are not taken.

<instruction>People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with diminished air quality. N95 masks are
effective at filtering out the majority of harmful air
particulates.
State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor
burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be
limited as much as possible. According to state air quality
agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants
close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with
your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
