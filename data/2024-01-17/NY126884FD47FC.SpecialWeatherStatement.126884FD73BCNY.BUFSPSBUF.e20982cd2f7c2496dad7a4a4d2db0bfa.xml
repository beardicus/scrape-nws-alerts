<description>...AN INTENSE BAND OF LAKE EFFECT SNOW WILL AFFECT PARTS OF CENTRAL
ERIE AND NORTHERN ERIE COUNTY...
HAZARDS...A band of very heavy lake effect snow which can rapidly
reduce visibility to less than a quarter of a mile. This lake effect
snow band is producing extremely heavy snow at the rate of 3 to 5
inches per hour in the heart of the band, especially closer to the
lakeshore.
LOCATION AND MOVEMENT...At 400 AM EST, an intense band of lake
effect snow was located from just north of Orchard Park to just
south of Buffalo and extending inland to the Elma, Lancaster and
Cheektowaga areas. This band will continue to slowly progress
northward through the early morning hours and will be squarely
across the Buffalo Metro area for the busy morning commute.
LOCATIONS IMPACTED INCLUDE...
Buffalo, Cheektowaga, West Seneca, Lackawanna, Depew, Lancaster,
Williamsville, Elma, Small Boat Harbor, Erie Basin Marina, Blasdell,
Elma Center, and Woodlawn Beach State Park.
This includes Interstate 90 between exits 49 and 56.
SAFETY INFO...
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time to reach your destination.
