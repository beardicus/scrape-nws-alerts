<description>...FLASH FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL FURTHER
NOTICE...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by the sudden shifting or break up of
an ice jam is possible.
* WHERE...The lower Kankakee River from near Wilmington downstream
to the confluence with the Illinois River, including portions of
Grundy and Will counties.
* WHEN...Until further notice.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous ice flows or shifting of ice may damage
structures along the shore. Additional roads and streets may be
flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A significant ice jam is located on the Kankakee River near
the confluence with the Illinois River to just upstream of
Wilmington. The ice jam is holding back a significant amount
of water. Sudden shifting or breaking of ice may occur at any
time over the next several days, which could cause new
flooding with limited advanced notice.

<instruction>A Flood Watch means flooding is possible, but not yet certain, based
upon the latest forecasts. Persons with interests along the Kankakee
River should be prepared to take action should additional flooding
develop.</instruction>
