<description>...AN INTENSE BAND OF LAKE EFFECT SNOW WILL AFFECT PARTS OF CENTRAL
ERIE AND NORTHERN ERIE COUNTY...
HAZARDS...A band of very heavy lake effect snow which can rapidly
reduce visibility to less than a quarter of a mile. This lake effect
snow band is producing very heavy snow at the rate of 2 to 3 inches
per hour in the heart of the band, with up to 4 inches per hour
locally, especially closer to the lakeshore.
LOCATION AND MOVEMENT...At 515 AM EST, an intense band of lake
effect snow was located from just north of Orchard Park to the city
of Buffalo and extending inland to the Lancaster ,Cheektowaga,
Clarence, and Williamsville areas. This band will continue to very
slowly progress northward through the early morning hours and will
be squarely across the Buffalo Metro area for the busy morning
commute.
This includes Interstate 90 between exits 49 and 56.
SAFETY INFO...
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time to reach your destination.
