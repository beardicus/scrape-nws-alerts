<description>...AN INTENSE BAND OF LAKE EFFECT SNOW BAND WILL AFFECT PARTS OF
NORTHERN ERIE COUNTY...
HAZARDS...A band of intense lake effect snow which can rapidly
reduce visibility to less than a quarter of a mile. This lake effect
snow band is producing extremely heavy snow at the rate of 2 to 4
inches per hour in the heart of the band, with up to 5 inches per
hour locally, especially closer to the lakeshore.
LOCATION AND MOVEMENT...At 643 AM EST, an intense band of lake
effect snow was located from Lackawanna into the city of Buffalo and
extended inland to West Seneca, Cheektowaga, Depew and Lancaster.
This band will continue to very slowly progress northward through
the morning hours and will be squarely across the Buffalo metro area
through the morning commute.
LOCATIONS IMPACTED INCLUDE...
Buffalo, Cheektowaga, West Seneca, Clarence, Lackawanna, Depew,
Amherst, Lancaster, Williamsville, Elma, Small Boat Harbor, Erie
Basin Marina, Blasdell, Woodlawn Beach State Park, Elma Center, and
Clarence Center.
This includes Interstate 90 between exits 49 and 56.
SAFETY INFO...
Use extra caution if you must travel into or through this lake
effect snow band. Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter
weather situations. Be prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow
down and allow extra time to reach your destination.
