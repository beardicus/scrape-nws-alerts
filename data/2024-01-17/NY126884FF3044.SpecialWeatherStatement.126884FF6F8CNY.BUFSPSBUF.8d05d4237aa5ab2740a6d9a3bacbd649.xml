<description>...A BAND OF HEAVY SNOW WILL AFFECT PARTS OF JEFFERSON AND LEWIS
COUNTIES...

up to 40 MPH which can rapidly reduce visibility to less than a
quarter of a mile. This band of heavy snow is producing extremely
heavy snow at the rate of 2 to 3 inches per hour.
LOCATION AND MOVEMENT...At 443 PM EST, a band of heavy snow was
along a line extending from Chaumont to Perch Lake to near Antwerp.
This band of lake effect snow is nearly stationary, but is expected
to start to slowly move south toward Watertown and Fort Drum.
LOCATIONS IMPACTED INCLUDE...
Watertown, Fort Drum, Stony Point, Carthage, Dexter, Glen Park,
Herrings, Henderson Harbor, Sackets Harbor, Henderson, Black River,
Smithville, Philadelphia, Brownville, Theresa, Cape Vincent, Antwerp,
Harrisville, Chaumont, and Evans Mills.
This includes Interstate 81 between exits 44 and 49.
SAFETY INFO...
Use extra caution if you must travel into or through this band of
heavy snow. Rapid changes in visibility and potentially slick roads
may lead to accidents.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time to reach your destination.
