<description>...AN INTENSE BAND OF LAKE EFFECT SNOW WILL AFFECT PARTS OF
JEFFERSON, OSWEGO, AND LEWIS COUNTIES...
HAZARDS...A band of very heavy lake effect snow which can rapidly
reduce visibility to less than a quarter of a mile. This lake effect
snow band is producing very heavy snow at the rate of 2 to 3 inches
per hour in the heart of the band, with up to 4 inches per hour
locally, especially from just north of Adams Center, north through
the Watertown area to near Fort Drum extending inland across the
northern Tug Hill.
LOCATION AND MOVEMENT...At 655 AM EST, an intense band of lake
effect snow was located from just north of Adams Center to Watertown
to near Fort Drum and extending inland across the northern Tug Hill.
This band has oscillated northward into the Watertown area over the
past hour, however areas around Ellisburg and Mannsville may see a
return of heavy snow over the next hour or so as the band oscillates
a bit. Heavy snow will impact the Watertown area morning commute.
LOCATIONS IMPACTED INCLUDE...
Watertown, Fort Drum, Stony Point, Carthage, Lowville, West Carthage,
Adams, Dexter, Glen Park, Herrings, Highmarket, Adams Center,
Southwick Beach State Park, Henderson Harbor, Barnes Corners,

Harbor.
This includes Interstate 81 between exits 37 and 48.

prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time to reach your destination.
