<headline>Flood Warning issued April 21 at 11:10AM CDT until April 23 at 1:00PM CDT by NWS Duluth</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in
Minnesota...
Snake River near Pine City affecting Pine County.
Prairie River near Taconite affecting Itasca County.
Mississippi River at Fort Ripley affecting Crow Wing and Morrison
Counties.
Mississippi River At Aitkin affecting Aitkin and Crow Wing
Counties.
.Snowmelt runoff combined with recent rainfall have pushed area
rivers into flood stage.  Cooler temperatures will help to slow
additional runoff allowing some area rivers to crest.  While the
Mississippi at Aitkin continues a slow but steady rise as water
routes through the Upper Mississippi Headwaters.
Cool and dry weather conditions are forecast for the next several
days so steady of falling flows are expected.  There was additional
snowfall added to these basins which will slowly melt during the
week. However, forecast overnight temperatures drop below freezing.
Keep in mind additional heavy precipitation in the future could
cause further flooding.
