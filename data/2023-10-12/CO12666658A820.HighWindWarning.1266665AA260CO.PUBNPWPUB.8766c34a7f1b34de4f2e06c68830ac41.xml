<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON MDT FRIDAY...
...FREEZE WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH
SATURDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...For the High Wind Warning, northwest winds 30 to 40 mph
with gusts up to 65 mph expected. For the Freeze Watch, sub-
freezing temperatures as low as 26 possible.
* WHERE...Kiowa County.
* WHEN...For the High Wind Warning, until noon MDT Friday. For
the Freeze Watch, from late Friday night through Saturday
morning.
* IMPACTS...Damaging winds could blow down trees and power lines.
Power outages are possible. Travel could be difficult along
east/west oriented roadways, especially for high profile
vehicles. Frost and freeze conditions could kill crops, other
sensitive vegetation and possibly damage unprotected outdoor
plumbing.</description>
<instruction>People should avoid being outside in forested areas and around
trees and branches. If possible, remain in the lower levels of
your home during the windstorm, and avoid windows. Use caution if
you must drive.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
