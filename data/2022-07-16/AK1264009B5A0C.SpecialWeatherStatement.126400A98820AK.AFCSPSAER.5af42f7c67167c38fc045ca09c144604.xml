<headline>Special Weather Statement issued July 16 at 1:07PM AKDT  by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>Widespread rain is expected to continue across Southcentral Alaska through
the end of the weekend as a series of storm systems move across the region.
The first storm system moved through overnight and this morning bringing heavy
rain to the area with the greatest amounts seen across the Western Susitna Valley,
where over 2.5&quot; has already fallen. A second storm system is then expected to bring
another round of moderate to heavy rain across the western Kenai Peninsula,
Anchorage Bowl, and Mat-Su Valleys for Sunday morning. Rain is
expected to taper off and transition to showers from west to east
across Southcentral through the day Sunday. More rain is possible
across Southcentral for early next week.
Storm total rainfall amounts will vary across the region through
the weekend. However, most locations will likely see their
heaviest rainfall totals in almost a year.
Observed rainfall totals Friday through Saturday Morning:
Anchorage Bowl: 0.5&quot; to 0.75&quot;
Matanuska Valley: 1.0&quot; to 1.5&quot;
Susitna Valley: 2.0&quot; to 2.75&quot;
Western Kenai Peninsula: 0.75&quot; to 1.0&quot;
Eastern Kenai Peninsula: 0.75&quot; to 1.5&quot;
Whittier and Portage Valley: 0.5&quot; to 1.0&quot;
Expected additional rainfall amounts Saturday afternoon through Monday morning:
Anchorage Bowl: 0.5&quot; to 0.75&quot;
Matanuska Valley: 0.5&quot; to 0.75&quot; (up to 2&quot; in the Talkeetna Mountains)
Susitna Valley: 1.0&quot; to 1.5&quot;
Western Kenai Peninsula: 0.25&quot; to 0.5&quot;
Eastern Kenai Peninsula: 0.5&quot; to 1.0&quot;
Whittier and Portage Valley: 1.0&quot; to 2.0&quot;
The prolonged rain event could push small streams and creeks to or
slightly above bankfull. Smaller rivers could see water levels
rise to bankfull, especially in the Mat-Su Valleys. Water levels
along larger rivers are expected to remain below bankfull due to
initial low water levels prior to the event.  The Kenai River is
expected to remain at bankfull through next week as heavy rain
works its way down into the river. In urban areas, ponding of
water and localized flooding on poorly drained roadways is also
possible. Please use caution when driving or when recreating along
or on area waterways.
