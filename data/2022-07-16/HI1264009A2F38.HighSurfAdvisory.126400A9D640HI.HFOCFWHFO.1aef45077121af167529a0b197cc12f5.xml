<headline>High Surf Advisory issued July 16 at 3:42AM HST until July 17 at 6:00AM HST by NWS Honolulu</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF WARNING NOW EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM MONDAY FOR SOUTH
FACING SHORES OF ALL ISLANDS...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM SUNDAY FOR EAST
FACING SHORES OF THE BIG ISLAND...
.Historic south swell out of the 170 to 190 degree direction will
produce dangerous waves along south facing shores today through
Sunday. A combination of large surf and regular predicted water
levels could lead to flooding of beaches that typically remain
dry, especially at and around the peak daily tide. The combined
elevated, rough trade wind swell and swells generated by Tropical
Storm Darby will produce advisory level surf for east facing
shores of the Big Island through tonight as the storm weakens and
passes south of the islands.
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM HST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Large breaking waves of 8 to 12 feet.
* WHERE...East facing shores of the Big Island.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM HST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Moderate. Expect strong breaking waves, shore break,
and strong longshore and rip currents making swimming
difficult and dangerous.</description>
<instruction>Beachgoers, swimmers, and surfers should heed all advice given by
