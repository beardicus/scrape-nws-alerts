<headline>Special Weather Statement issued July 16 at 5:46PM EDT  by NWS Blacksburg</headline>
<description>...A strong thunderstorm will impact portions of
east central Patrick County through 615 PM EDT...
At 546 PM EDT, Doppler radar was tracking a strong thunderstorm near
Buffalo Ridge, or near Woolwine. This storm was nearly stationary.
HAZARD...Winds in excess of 30 mph and pea size hail.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around
unsecured objects. Minor damage to outdoor objects is
possible.
This storm will remain over mainly rural areas of
east central Patrick County.
MAX HAIL SIZE...0.25 IN
MAX WIND GUST...30 MPH</description>
<instruction>If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.
Locally heavy rain will quickly reduce visibility and result in
ponding of water on roadways, standing water in low lying areas, and
minor flooding of creeks, streams, and areas of poor drainage.
Drivers are urged to slow down and use extra caution to avoid
hydroplaning.
This storm may intensify, so be certain to monitor local radio
stations and available television stations for additional information
and possible warnings from the National Weather Service.</instruction>
