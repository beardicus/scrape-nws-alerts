<headline>Red Flag Warning issued July 16 at 9:14PM PDT until July 17 at 9:00PM PDT by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...Gusty winds with low RH Sunday and Monday...
.An upper level trough will pass to our north on Sunday. This
trough will produce gusty winds again on Sunday and Monday
afternoons, that when combined with very low relative humidities,
will likely result in critical fire weather conditions.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM TO 9 PM PDT SUNDAY
FOR STRONG GUSTY WIND WITH LOW RH FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONE 624...
* Impacts: Strong, gusty wind with low relative humidity and
critically dry vegetation will greatly increase the spread
potential of any new and existing fires.
* Affected area: In South Central Oregon: Southern Fire Zone 624,
including Lakeview, Valley Falls, the Warner Mountains, and
portions of the Fremont-Winema National Forest.
* Wind: West 10 to 20 mph with gusts up to 30 mph.

Precautionary/preparedness actions...
Avoid tossing burning cigarettes on the ground, parking hot
vehicles on dry vegetation, and using equipment that can cause
sparks. Follow all fire restrictions. Find links to restrictions
at weather.gov/medford/wildfire. One less spark, one less
wildfire.
A Red Flag Warning does not mean there is a fire. It means that
critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now or will
shortly. These conditions promote rapid spread of fire which may
become life threatening. Evacuate if ordered to, or if a fire
threatens.
