<description>...Patchy Dense Fog Across Northwest Portions of Orange County
Early This Morning...
At 730 AM, traffic cameras and satellite imagery showed locally
dense fog had formed across northwest Orange County. The fog
appeared to be a little more dense and widespread north of
Florida`s Turnpike through the Apopka and Zellwood areas.
Visibilities across this area may be reduced to around a quarter
of a mile or less.
Motorist on areas roadways north of Florida`s Turnpike and west of
I-4 in Orange County, such as State Road 429, and U.S. Route 441
should prepare to encounter rapid changes in visibility from
locally dense fog. When driving in fog, reduce your speed, use
only your low beam headlights, and leave extra distance between
your vehicle and the one in front of you.
The fog is expected to burn off between 8 and 9 AM.</description>
