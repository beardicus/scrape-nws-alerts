<description>...Patchy Dense Fog Across Parts of Lake and Inland Volusia
Counties Early This Morning...
At 530 AM, surface observations and satellite imagery showed
locally dense fog had formed across Lake and northwest Volusia
Counties. The fog appeared to be a little more dense and
widespread across northern Lake County, from the Villages
eastward across the Ocala Forest to Lake George and the along
the Saint Johns River basin.
Visibilities across this area may be reduced to less then one
mile in some locations and could drop to a few hundred yards or
less prior to sunrise.
Motorist on areas roadways north of I-4, such as State Roads 44
and 19, and U.S. Highway 17 should prepare to encounter rapid
changes in visibility from locally dense fog. When driving in fog,
reduce your speed, use only your low beam headlights, and leave
extra distance between your vehicle and the one in front of you.
The fog is expected to burn off between 8 and 9 AM.</description>
