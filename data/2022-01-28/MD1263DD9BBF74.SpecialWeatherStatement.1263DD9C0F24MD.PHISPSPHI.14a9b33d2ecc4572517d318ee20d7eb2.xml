<headline>Special Weather Statement issued January 28 at 10:41PM EST  by NWS Philadelphia - Mount Holly</headline>
<description>...Heavy snow and increasing winds are expected to produce rapidly
deteriorating conditions during the overnight hours...
At 1035 pm, radar indicated a band of heavy snow developing from
Caroline County in Maryland and Sussex County in Delaware
northeastward to eastern Burlington County in New Jersey. The band
is expected to continue developing northeastward into Ocean and
Monmouth Counties during the overnight, and its relative position
may move little for at least the next few hours. Snowfall rates
are expected to increase to one to two inches per hour at times
within this band. Additionally, north-northeast winds will
increase to 20 to 30 mph with higher gusts. Deteriorating
visibilities are expected with nearly impossible travel possible
late tonight, especially near the coast, where a blizzard warning
remains in effect.
Travel is strongly discouraged. If you must travel, bring a winter
survival kit. If you become stranded, stay with your vehicle.</description>
