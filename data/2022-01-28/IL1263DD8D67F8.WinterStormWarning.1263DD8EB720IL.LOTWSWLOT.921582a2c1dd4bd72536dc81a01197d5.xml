<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST TODAY...
* WHAT...Dangerous travel conditions and intense lake effect snow
expected. Snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour will lead to
total snow accumulations of 4 and 8 inches especially over
southeastern Lake and northern Cook counties. Locally higher
totals are possible. Western portions of Lake County Illinois
and far western portions of northern Cook County could end up
with less than an inch of accumulation.
* WHERE...Lake IL and Northern Cook Counties.
* WHEN...Through noon today.
* IMPACTS...Conditions will be highly variable, potentially going
from just flurries to near white out conditions in heavy snow
over just a few mile stretch. Under the intense snow band,
travel will be extremely difficult including during the height
of this mornings commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...If travel cannot be postponed, plan for
significantly longer travel times in areas impacted by the most
intense snowfall.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
