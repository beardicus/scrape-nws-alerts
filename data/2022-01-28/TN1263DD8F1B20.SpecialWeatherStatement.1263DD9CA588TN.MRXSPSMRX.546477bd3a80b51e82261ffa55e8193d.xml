<description>...Very Light Snow and Frigid Temperatures Tonight...
Light snow will be possible this evening through tonight. An
isolated dusting of snow is possible with localized amounts up to
one-half inch across higher elevation such as Signal Mountain,
Lookout Mountain, Mowbray Mountain, and Flat Top Mountain. Lower
elevations around Chattanooga are not forecast to receive
measurable snow accumulation. Any light snow, combined with the
very cold temperatures, may result in some untreated and
secondary roads becoming snow and ice covered. Even minimal snow
accumulation can cause slick and hazardous road conditions. Use
caution if traveling.
In addition, very cold temperatures and brisk northwest winds will
result in frigid wind chills late tonight and Saturday morning
between zero and 10 above zero. Higher elevations will see wind
chill values between zero and five below zero. Limit exposure to
the cold, dress in layers suitable for the cold weather if you
must be outdoors, cover any exposed skin, and ensure animals and
pets have warm shelter from the extreme cold.</description>
