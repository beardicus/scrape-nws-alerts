<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued January 28 at 11:35AM EST until January 29 at 11:00AM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM TO 11 AM EST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...One to locally two feet of inundation above ground level
expected in vulnerable north shore communities of the twin
forks of LI, north shore of LI, and north facing LI barrier
island communities for the Sat AM high tide near the waterfront
and shoreline.
* WHERE...Northwest Suffolk, Northeast Suffolk, Southwest
Suffolk, Southeast Suffolk, Northern Nassau and Southern
Nassau Counties.
* WHEN...From 3 AM to 11 AM EST Saturday.
* COASTAL IMPACTS...Minor to locally moderate flooding is expected
in the most vulnerable locations near the waterfront and
shoreline. Expect around 1 to locally 2 feet of inundation above
ground level in low lying, vulnerable areas. A few to several
roads and low lying property including parking lots, parks,
lawns and homes/businesses with basements near the waterfront
will experience shallow flooding. A few cars may take on water
and be damaged if not moved.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...3 to 5 ft surf likely for north shore of LI
and north shore of south fork shorefront with Sat AM tides,
which will likely cause beach erosion and possibly minor damage
to shoreline structures. Along the oceanfront, surf should build
to 4 to 8 ft Sat PM into Sun AM, with scattered dune erosion
impacts during those tidal cycles.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Minor to locally moderate coastal impacts
are possible for the same north shore communities of the twin
forks of LI, north shore of LI, and north facing LI barrier
island communities for the Saturday evening high tides as well.
There is potential for more widespread minor coastal flooding
along the southern and eastern bayfront communities of Long
Island with the Sunday morning high tide.</description>
