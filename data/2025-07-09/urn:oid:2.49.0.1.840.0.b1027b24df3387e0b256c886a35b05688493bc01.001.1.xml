        <headline>Flood Advisory issued July 9 at 7:49PM EDT until July 9 at 10:45PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg SC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...Nuisance to Minor flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
expected.

* WHERE...A portion of piedmont North Carolina, including the
following counties, Davie, Iredell, and Rowan.

* WHEN...Until 1045 PM EDT.

* IMPACTS...Nuisance to Minor flooding of low-lying areas adjacent
to streams and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland,
parks, greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses,
and parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is
possible.  A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may become
impassible.  A small culvert washout or two is possible.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 738 PM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated heavy rain is ongoing due to multiple slow-moving
thunderstorm cells extending southwest to northeast from
Troutman and Doolie to Mount Ulla, Cleveland, Woodleaf,
Cooleemee, Fork Church, and Advance.  Between 1 and 2 inches
of rain has fallen over the past 45-60 minutes.  These cells
are training from southwest to northeast over the same areas,
prompting concerns for excessive runoff capable of producing
areas of nuisance to Minor flooding.

Areas of greatest concern include along the headwaters of
North Second Creek from Mount Ulla to Woodleaf, including
flood-prone low-water crossings at White Rd, Lyerly Rd,
Upright Rd, Graham Rd, Hall Rd, Childers Rd, and Bear Poplar
Rd.  Additionally, areas along Third Creek and associated
tributaries, from eastern portions of Statesville and points
east, including near Shiloh Rd, Triplett Rd, Third Creek
Church Rd, and Carson Rd.  Urbanized areas including eastern
Stateville and Cleveland may experience deep ponding due to
poor drainage.

- An additional 2-3 inches of rain is possible over the next
60-90 minutes due to these very slow-moving cells and the
movement of  additional thunderstorm cells into the Advisory
area from the south and west.  This rainfall may exacerbate
developing flooding or cause new areas of flooding to
develop.  If these cells persist for an additional 60 minutes
or longer, a Flash Flood Warning may be issued.  Caution is
advised near any stream or other vulnerable area.  Seek
higher ground immediately if streams start to rise.  Please
have a plan in place should flash flooding develop and do not
hesitate to act.

- Some locations that may experience nuisance to Minor flooding
include...
Salisbury, Statesville, Mocksville, Mooresville, Troutman,
Cooleemee, Cleveland, Lake Norman State Park, Woodleaf, Mount
Ulla, Fork Church and Advance.

        <instruction>Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.

Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.

Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.

In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
