        <headline>Flood Advisory issued July 9 at 9:08PM EDT until July 10 at 12:00AM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg SC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...Nuisance flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.

* WHERE...Eastern Lincoln County, North Carolina

* WHEN...Until midnight EDT tonight.

* IMPACTS...Nuisance to Minor flooding of low-lying areas adjacent
to streams and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland,
parks, greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses,
and parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is
possible.  A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may become
impassible.  A small culvert washout or two is possible.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 859 PM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated heavy rain is ongoing due to multiple slow-moving
thunderstorm cells currently shifting slowly to the south and
east, departing Lincoln County.  Between 2 and 3 inches of
rain has fallen over the past 75-90 minutes.  These cells
were initially training from west to east over the same
areas, prompting concerns for excessive runoff capable of
producing areas of nuisance to Minor flooding.

Areas of greatest concern include near Pumpkin Center and Ore
Bank Branch near King Wilkinson Rd and Ashbury Church Rd and
Reed and Leeper creeks near Furnace Rd and NC 73.

- Heavy rain is slowly departing the area to the east; however,
another inch of rainfall is possible across the southern and
eastern portions of the Advisory area, primarily from Iron
Station to Lowesville.  This may be enough rain to cause
isolated areas of nuisance flooding to develop near the
Gaston County line.

- Some locations that may experience nuisance flooding
include...
Westport, Denver, Iron Station, and Lowesville.
