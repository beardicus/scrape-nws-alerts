        <headline>Flash Flood Warning issued July 9 at 8:50PM EDT until July 9 at 11:45PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg SC</headline>
        <description>FFWGSP

The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has issued a

* Flash Flood Warning for...
Central Lincoln County in the piedmont of North Carolina...

* Until 1145 PM EDT.

* At 850 PM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated
heavy rain is ongoing due to multiple slow-moving thunderstorm
cells extending west to east to northeast from Crouse to
Lincolnton to Boger City.  Between 2.5 and 4 inches of rain has
fallen over the past 60-90 minutes.  Enough additional rainfall
has occurred since a Flood Advisory was issued to require a Flash
Flood Warning, as more significant flooding could be developing
across areas near and including Lincolnton and Boger City.

* Areas of greatest concern include along small streams near Huss
St, Walker Branch near N Aspen St and N Flint St, Lithia Inn
Branch near Jerry Crump Rd and Jonas Dr.  Clarks Creek near Clarks
Creek Rd and Jeb Seagle Dr may also rise out of its banks.
Significant flooding of adjacent low-lying areas is possible with
isolated impact to structures.

HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.

SOURCE...Radar and automated gauges.

IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban
areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as
other poor drainage and low-lying areas.

* Some locations that may experience flash flooding include...
Lincolnton, Boger City, Iron Station and Crouse.

The heaviest rainfall is slowly moving south of Lincolnton and east
of Boger City.  However, it will take at least another 30-60 minutes
for streams to crest and recede and the flood threat will linger for
at least another 1-2 hours.  Please avoid all streams and flooded
roadways.

Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
