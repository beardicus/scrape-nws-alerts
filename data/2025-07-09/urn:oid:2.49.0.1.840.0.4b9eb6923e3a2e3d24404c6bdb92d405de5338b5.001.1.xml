        <headline>Flood Advisory issued July 9 at 7:18PM EDT until July 9 at 10:00PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg SC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...Nuisance to Minor flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
expected.

* WHERE...A portion of piedmont North Carolina, including the
following counties, Catawba and Iredell.

* WHEN...Until 1000 PM EDT.

* IMPACTS...Nuisance to Minor flooding of low-lying areas adjacent
to streams and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland,
parks, greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses,
and parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is
possible.  A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may become
impassible.  A small culvert washout or two is possible.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 717 PM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated heavy rain is ongoing due to multiple slow-moving
thunderstorm cells over southeastern central and eastern
Catawba County.  Between 1 and 3 inches of rain has fallen
over the past 60-75 minutes.  Another cell has moved into the
Advisory area over the past few minutes, prompting concerns
for excessive runoff capable of producing areas of nuisance
to Minor flooding.

Areas of greatest concern include along Lyle Creek near
Section House Rd, County Home Rd, the Rock Bard Golf and Spa,
and NC 16, the confluence of Lyle Creek and Mull Creek near
Bunker Hill School Rd.  Urbanized areas of Newton, Concord,
Claremont, and Catawba, including along and near US 70 and
I-40, may experience areas of deep ponding due to poor
draining and overflowing small feeder streams.

- An additional 1-2 inches of rain is possible over the next
hour due to these very slow-moving cells and the movement of
additional thunderstorm cells into the Advisory area from the
south and west.  This rainfall may exacerbate developing
flooding or cause new areas of flooding to develop.  If these
cells persist for an additional 30 minutes or longer, a Flash
Flood Warning may be issued.  Caution is advised near any
stream or other vulnerable area.  Seek higher ground
immediately if streams start to rise.  Please have a plan in
place should flash flooding develop and do not hesitate to
act.

- Some locations that may experience nuisance to Minor flooding
include...
Hickory, Newton, St. Stephens, Conover, Stony Point,
Claremont, Catawba, Lake Norman State Park, Sherrills Ford,
Bandys, Scotts and Startown.
