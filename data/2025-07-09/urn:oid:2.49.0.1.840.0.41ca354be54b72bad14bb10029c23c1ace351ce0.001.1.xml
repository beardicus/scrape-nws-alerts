        <headline>Flood Advisory issued July 9 at 6:35PM EDT until July 9 at 9:30PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg SC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...Nuisance to Minor flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
expected.

* WHERE...Extreme southeastern Chester County, South Carolina

* WHEN...Until 930 PM EDT.

* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks,
greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and
parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.
A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.  A
small culvert washout or two is possible.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 627 PM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated heavy rain is ongoing due to multiple slow-moving
thunderstorm cells over southeastern Chester County.  Between
1 and 2.5 inches of rain has fallen over the past 90-120
minutes.  Another cell has moved into the Advisory area over
the past few minutes, prompting concerns for excessive runoff
capable of producing areas of nuisance to Minor flooding.

Areas of greatest concern include along Little Rocky Creek
near Rodd Dye Rd and SC 97, Hodges Branch near SC 138/Golf
Course Rd and the Republic Golf Club, and poorly draining
areas near and within Great Falls and Beckhamville.

- An additional 1-2 inches of rain is possible over the next
hour due to these very slow-moving cells.  This rainfall may
exacerbate developing flooding or cause new areas of flooding
to develop.  If these cells persist for longer than
anticipated, a Flash Flood Warning may be issued.  Caution is
advised near any stream or other vulnerable area.  Seek
higher ground immediately if streams start to rise.  Please
have a plan in place should flash flooding develop and do not
hesitate to act.

- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Beckhamville, Nitrolee, Great Falls.
