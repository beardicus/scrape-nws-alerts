<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued September 11 at 3:39AM EDT until September 11 at 5:30AM EDT by NWS Binghamton</headline>
<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 530 AM EDT EARLY THIS
MORNING FOR SOUTHWESTERN BROOME, SOUTHEASTERN TIOGA, NORTHEASTERN
BRADFORD AND NORTHWESTERN SUSQUEHANNA COUNTIES...
At 339 AM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated
between 1 and 3.5 inches of rain have fallen across the warned area.
Less than a half inch of additional rain is expected, but flash
flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly from the earlier
heavy rain.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar and automated gauges.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,
highways, streets and underpasses as well as other poor
drainage and low-lying areas.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Endicott, Owego, Vestal, Wysox, Windham, Nichols, Rome, Le
Raysville, Little Meadows, Friendsville, Warren Center, Apalachin,
Tioga Terrace, Lounsberry, Vestal Center, Orwell, West Warren,
Campville and Macedonia.
Wappasening Creek, Apalachin Creek, and Tracy Creek will be
especially vulnerable to potential flash flooding.
The Wappesening Creek gage near Windham shot up almost 4 feet in 2
hours, but appears to have crested around 9.3 feet and is beginning
to fall. Rises may still be underway towards the Wappesening
confluence with the Susquehanna River near Nichols.
