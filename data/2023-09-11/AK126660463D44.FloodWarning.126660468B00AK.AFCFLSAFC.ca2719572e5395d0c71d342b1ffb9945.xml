<description>...FLOOD WARNING FOR A GLACIER-DAMMED LAKE OUTBURST REMAINS IN
EFFECT UNTIL NOON AKDT SUNDAY ALONG KENAI RIVER...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by a glacier-dammed lake outburst continues.
* WHERE...Kenai River below Skilak Lake, including Kenai Keys.
* WHEN...Until noon AKDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of Kenai River and flood-prone locations is
imminent or occurring.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 939 AM AKDT, river gauge reports and satellite data
indicate rises in water levels from two glacier-dammed lake
outbursts across the warned area, including one from the
release of Snow Glacier-dammed lake outburst that occurred
near Snow River and compounded by the additional release
occurring from Skilak Glacier-dammed lake outburst. River
rises will cause flooding along the Kenai River.
- Water levels along the Kenai River will continue to increase
throughout this week. High water levels are expected further
downstream in the lower Kenai River, but flooding is not
expected for the lower Kenai River at this time.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
- For Kenai River below Skilak Lake:
At 8:30am the stage was 13.63 feet.
Flood Stage is 13.0 feet.
Forecast: A crest around 15.1 feet is expected around 10:00pm
Tuesday.
Impacts:
At 15.0 feet: Water inundates the Kenai Keys neighborhood.
- For Kenai River at Kenai Keys:
At 9:00am the stage was 11.58 feet.
Flood Stage is 11.0 feet.
Forecast: A crest around 12.9 feet is expected around 10:00pm
Tuesday.
Impacts:
At 10.7 feet: In October of 2020, water was in the lowest
lying garages of the Kenai Keys subdivision.
At 12.0 feet: Water starts to flow over some of the roads in
the Kenai Keys subdivision.
At 13.2 feet: In 2012, water was 2 feet deep over Kenai Keys
Road, near the entrance to the subdivison.
At 13.5 feet: Water starts to flow into garages and cabins in
the Kenai Keys subdivision; and likely flooding downstream.
- Inherent uncertainty in initial glacier lake volume will
result in varying crest height and timing.
