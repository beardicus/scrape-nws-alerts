<headline>Flood Warning issued September 29 at 1:14PM EDT until further notice by NWS Philadelphia - Mount Holly</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Portions of central and southern New Jersey, including the
following counties, in central New Jersey...Monmouth. In southern
New Jersey...Ocean.
* WHEN...Until 700 PM EDT Friday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring. Expect many
areas of slow moving or standing water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1257 PM EDT, Doppler radar, automated rain gauges, trained
spotters, and local law enforcement all indicated moderate to
heavy rain across portions of the warned area and associated
flooding. Since the rain started early this morning, between
1 and 4 inches have fallen. The heaviest rain has fallen
between Oceanport and Manasquan. As we go into this evening,
another 1 to 2 inches is possible. The rain may even extend
through the overnight and into tomorrow. Low spots in
roadways are seeing slow moving or standing water. As a
result, law enforcement have reported both stranded vehicles
and motorists needing assistance. With more rain expected
into the evening, the Flood Advisory has been upgraded to
this Flood Warning. The higher than normal tides the area has
been seeing the last week are also impeding drainage. Local
law enforcement are asking motorists to avoid flooded
roadways. Turn around and find alternate routes.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Toms River, Long Branch, Asbury Park, Sandy Hook, Lakewood,
Middletown, Jackson, Howell, Marlboro, Tinton Falls, Holmdel,
and Red Bank.
