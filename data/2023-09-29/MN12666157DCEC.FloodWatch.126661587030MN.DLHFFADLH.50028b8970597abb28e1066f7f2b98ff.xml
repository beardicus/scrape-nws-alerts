<headline>Flood Watch issued September 29 at 6:23AM CDT until September 29 at 10:00AM CDT by NWS Duluth</headline>
<description>.A couple rounds of showers and thunderstorms are expected. The
first will develop this morning with a lull developing this
afternoon before a second round moves in Friday night. Any rain that
occurs today will further moisten soils and route more water into
rivers and creeks. The rain tonight may be heavy as well and cause
flooding.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THIS EVENING THROUGH SATURDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...In Minnesota, Southern Lake, Carlton and southern St.
Louis Counties. This includes the Tribal Lands of the Fond du Lac
Band.
* WHEN...From this evening through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rainfall Friday night and early Saturday morning may be
locally heavy with rain amounts of 2 inches or more possible.
Portions of the North Shore and adjacent areas farther inland
received heavy rainfall last weekend which increased soil
moisture across the watch area. Additional heavy rainfall may
lead to localized flooding Friday night and early Saturday
morning.
- Flood safety information can be found at
www.weather.gov/safety/flood.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
