<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued September 29 at 2:42PM EDT until September 30 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Wakefield</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...|A high risk of rip currents.
* WHERE...In Maryland, Maryland Beaches County. In North
Carolina, Eastern Currituck County. In Virginia, Virginia
Beach, and Accomack and Northampton Counties.
* WHEN...Through Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions.</description>
<instruction>Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
