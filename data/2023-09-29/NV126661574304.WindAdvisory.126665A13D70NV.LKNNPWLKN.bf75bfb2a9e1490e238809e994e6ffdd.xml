* WHEN...8 AM TO 8 PM PDT SATURDAY

power outages are possible. Southerly winds perpendicular to
portions of areas like U.S. 50 near Ely may make driving
difficult at times, especially if operating a high profile
vehicle. Intermittent periods of blowing dust may also reduce
road visibility unexpectedly. Use caution when driving.

higher mountain passes and summits, and areas near Ely and east.</description>
<instruction>A wind advisory means that sustained winds of 30 mph with gusts
in excess of 45 mph are expected. Winds this strong can make
driving difficult, especially for high profile vehicles. Use
extra caution.</instruction>
