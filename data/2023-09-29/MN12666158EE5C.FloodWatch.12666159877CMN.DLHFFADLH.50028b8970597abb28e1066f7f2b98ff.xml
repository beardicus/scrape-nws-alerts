<headline>Flood Watch issued September 29 at 1:23PM CDT until September 29 at 5:15PM CDT by NWS Duluth</headline>
<description>.Heavy rain and thunderstorms are expected to redevelop this
evening and overnight. Accumulations around 0.5 to 2 inches with
locally higher amounts will be possible. This heavy rain will fall
over saturated soils and high river and stream levels from
rainfall in the past week. With both effects combined, flooding
issues may result. The Flood Watch has been expanded southward to
include Pine and Douglas counties, where some of these locally
higher rainfall totals may fall.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THIS EVENING THROUGH
SATURDAY MORNING...
The Flood Watch continues for
* A portion of northeast Minnesota, including the following
areas, Carlton and South St. Louis and Southern Lake.
* From 10 PM CDT this evening through Saturday morning
* WHEN...From this evening through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone
locations. Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rainfall tonight and early Saturday morning may be locally
heavy with rain amounts of 2 inches or more possible. Portions
of the North Shore and adjacent areas farther inland received
heavy rainfall last weekend which increased soil moisture
across the watch area. Additional heavy rainfall may lead to
localized flooding tonight and early Saturday morning.
- Flood safety information can be found at
www.weather.gov/safety/flood.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible
Flood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be
prepared to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
