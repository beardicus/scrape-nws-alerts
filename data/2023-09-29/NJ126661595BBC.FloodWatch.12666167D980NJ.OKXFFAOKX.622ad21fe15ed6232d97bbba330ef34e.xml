<headline>Flood Watch issued September 29 at 5:03PM EDT until September 30 at 12:00PM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE TONIGHT...
* WHAT...There continues to be potential for scattered to numerous
instances of flash flooding. Locally considerable and life
threatening flash flooding remains possible.
* WHERE...Portions of southern Connecticut, including the following
areas, Northern Fairfield, Northern New Haven, Southern Fairfield
and Southern New Haven. Portions of northeast New Jersey,
including the following areas, Eastern Bergen, Eastern Essex,
Eastern Passaic, Eastern Union, Hudson, Western Bergen, Western
Essex, Western Passaic and Western Union. Portions of southeast
New York, including the following areas, Bronx, Kings (Brooklyn),
New York (Manhattan), Northeast Suffolk, Northern Nassau, Northern
Queens, Northern Westchester, Northwest Suffolk, Orange, Putnam,
Richmond (Staten Island), Rockland, Southeast Suffolk, Southern
Nassau, Southern Queens, Southern Westchester and Southwest
Suffolk.
* WHEN...Through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...There continues to be potential for scattered to
numerous instances of flash flooding, especially in urban and poor
drainage areas. Locally considerable and life threatening flash
flooding remains possible where axis of heaviest rain develops and
sits for several hours. If this heavier rainfall axis develops
over the flashy river and stream basins of northeastern NJ, Lower
Hudson Valley, and southwestern CT, moderate flood stages could be
exceeded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Additional rainfall of 1 to 3 inches is forecast with locally
higher amounts possible. There are already areas which have
experienced flooding and the additional rain will exacerbate
the flooding in these areas. In addition, heavy rain
coinciding with high tide for coastal sections will further
exacerbate flooding there.
