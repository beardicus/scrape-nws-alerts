<headline>Coastal Flood Watch issued September 29 at 8:25PM EDT until October 02 at 2:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM 7 AM EDT SATURDAY
THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING NORTH OF CAPE HATTERAS...
...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH
MONDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents,
large breaking waves expected, and strong longshore currents in
the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Watch, two to four feet of
inundation above ground level possible in low- lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...Northern Outer Banks and Hatteras Island.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, from 7 AM EDT Saturday
through Saturday evening. For the Coastal Flood Watch, from
Sunday morning through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Up to 2 to 4 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in some areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in a significant threat to life and property. In some
areas, battering waves will cause additional damage to property.
Several roads including NC 12 will likely be impassable during
around high tide and vehicles will be submerged. Rip currents
can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper
water. Dangerous shore break can throw a swimmer or surfer head
first into the bottom causing neck and back injuries. Strong
longshore currents will create dangerous swimming conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most likely time for strong rip
currents to occur is a couple hours either side of low tide,
which will occur around 3 pm tomorrow afternoon.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
