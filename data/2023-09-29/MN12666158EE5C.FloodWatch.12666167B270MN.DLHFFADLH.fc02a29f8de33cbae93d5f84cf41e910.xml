<headline>Flood Watch issued September 29 at 1:23PM CDT  by NWS Duluth</headline>
<description>.Heavy rain and thunderstorms are expected to redevelop this
evening and overnight. Accumulations around 0.5 to 2 inches with
locally higher amounts will be possible. This heavy rain will fall
over saturated soils and high river and stream levels from
rainfall in the past week. With both effects combined, flooding
issues may result. The Flood Watch has been expanded southward to
include Pine and Douglas counties, where some of these locally
higher rainfall totals may fall.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM 10 PM CDT THIS EVENING THROUGH
SATURDAY MORNING...
The National Weather Service in Duluth has expanded the
* Flood Watch to include portions of east central Minnesota and
northwest Wisconsin, including the following areas, in east
central Minnesota, Pine. In northwest Wisconsin, Douglas.
* From 10 PM CDT this evening through Saturday morning
* WHEN...From this evening through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone
locations. Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rainfall tonight and early Saturday morning may be locally
heavy with rain amounts of 2 inches or more possible. Portions
of northern Pine and Douglas Counties received heavy rainfall
last weekend which increased soil moisture and river heights across
the watch area. Additional heavy rainfall may lead to
localized flooding tonight and early Saturday morning.
