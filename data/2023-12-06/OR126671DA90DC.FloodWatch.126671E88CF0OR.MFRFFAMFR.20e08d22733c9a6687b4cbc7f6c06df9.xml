<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Western Douglas County, Coos and Curry Counties, and
western Josephine County, including the communities of Myrtle
Point, Coquille and Scottsburg. The Southern Oregon Coast,
including the communities of Gold Beach, Port Orford, Bandon, and
Coos Bay. This also includes portions of Highway 101, Highway 38
and Highway 42.
* WHEN...Through this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. Rock falls and isolated
mudslides are possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Moderate to heavy rain will continue this morning as a plume
of moisture remains stalled across Coos, Curry and western
Douglas counties. Another 1 to 3 inches of rain is likely
across a large portion of the area through this afternoon
with up to 5 inches in the coastal ranges of Curry and
western Josephine counties. This will lead to an increased
risk of flooding.
