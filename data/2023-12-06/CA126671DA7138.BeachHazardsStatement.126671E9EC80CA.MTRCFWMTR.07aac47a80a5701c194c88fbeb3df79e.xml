<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued December 06 at 2:54AM PST until December 07 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE
TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Breaking waves of 9 to 13 feet expected.
* WHERE...Northern Monterey Bay County.
* WHEN...Until 4 AM PST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Large waves can sweep across the
beach without warning, pulling people into the sea from rocks,
jetties, and beaches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Large northwest waves will peak this
morning. Northwest facing beaches are most at risk for large,
turbulent shore break and strong currents.</description>
<instruction>Remain out of the water to avoid hazardous swimming conditions.
Larger breaking waves along the coast will lead to increased run-
up on beaches with waves topping and washing over large rocks and
jetties. Use caution near the surf zone as these larger waves
will be capable of sweeping people into the water. Avoid rocks
and jetties. Avoid steep beaches. Stay farther back from the
water and never turn your back on the ocean.</instruction>
