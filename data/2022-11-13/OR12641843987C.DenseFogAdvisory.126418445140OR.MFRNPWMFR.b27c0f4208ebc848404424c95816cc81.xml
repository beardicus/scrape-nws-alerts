<description>...DENSE FOG ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM PST THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Visibility of a quarter mile or less in dense fog.
* WHERE...Portions of the Rogue Valley including Medford, Ashland,
Phoenix, Talent, Gold Hill, and Rogue River. This also includes
portions of Interstate 5.
* WHEN...Until 8 AM PST this morning.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous driving conditions due to low visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...As of 3:30 AM, the Dense Fog is mainly at

* View the hazard area in detail at
https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/map/?wfo=mfr</description>
<instruction>* Slow down and allow for plenty of room between you and other
vehicles.
* Fog makes objects appear farther away than they are
* Use low beams. High beams reflect back thick fog, making
visibility worse for you and other drivers.
* Be prepared. Keep your headlights clean. That way, you`re
ready for low-visibility conditions
* Don`t use cruise control. Most crashes occur because the
driver is going too fast for weather conditions.</instruction>
