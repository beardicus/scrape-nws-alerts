<description>...AREAS OF LAKE EFFECT SNOW TONIGHT...
Areas of Lake Effect Snow have increased in intensity along
Southern Lake and Northern Bayfield Counties. Expect a reduction
in visibilities as low as a half a mile. Heavy snow will continue
for a few more hours then the precipitation should become light
snow. Southern Lake County can expect a quick half inch to inch in
accumulation and northern Bayfield County could experience a
quick 1 to 3 inches. This will likely coat roadways and cause
slick conditions. Please use extreme caution... especially on
bridges...overpasses and around curves. Allow plenty of stopping
distance and avoid braking suddenly.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations.
Be prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow
extra time when traveling.</description>
