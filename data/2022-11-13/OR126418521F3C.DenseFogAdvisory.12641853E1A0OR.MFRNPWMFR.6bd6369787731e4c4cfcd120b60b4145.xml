<headline>Dense Fog Advisory issued November 13 at 10:47PM PST until November 14 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...DENSE FOG ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST MONDAY...
...AIR STAGNATION OUTLOOK REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY EVENING
THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...For the Dense Fog Advisory, visibility less than a
quarter of a mile in dense freezing fog. For the Air Stagnation
Outlook, stagnant air is expected, which may lead to
deteriorating air quality expected.
* WHERE...The valleys of Central and Eastern Lake County.
* WHEN...For the Dense Fog Advisory, until 10 AM PST Monday. For
the Air Stagnation Outlook, from Tuesday evening through
Friday morning.
* IMPACTS...Dense freezing fog will result in very low
visibilities and slick road surfaces. Air stagnation is likely
to result in diminishing air quality with time, especially in
and near areas with significant sources of air pollution.
Diminished air quality is likely to cause health issues for
people with respiratory problems if precautions are not taken.
* View the hazard area in detail at
https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/map/?wfo=mfr</description>
<instruction>* Slow down and allow for plenty of room between you and other
vehicles.
* Fog makes objects appear farther away than they are
* Use low beams. High beams reflect back thick fog, making
visibility worse for you and other drivers.
* Be prepared. Keep your headlights clean. That way, you`re
ready for low-visibility conditions
* Don`t use cruise control. Most crashes occur because the
driver is going too fast for weather conditions.</instruction>
