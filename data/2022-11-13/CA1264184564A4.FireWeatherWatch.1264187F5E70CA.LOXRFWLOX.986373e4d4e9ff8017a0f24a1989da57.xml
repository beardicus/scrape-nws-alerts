<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued November 13 at 3:05PM PST until November 16 at 7:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IS IN EFFECT FOR WESTERN LOS ANGELES COUNTY
AND MUCH OF VENTURA COUNTY FROM 7 AM TO 7 PM WEDNESDAY...
.Strong high pressure building into the Great Basin may support
the first strong Santa Ana event of the season Tuesday night into
Wednesday. Strong cold air advection will generally limit relative
humidity values above critical values Tuesday night even as
potentially damaging winds develop (see NPWLOX for details on
HIGH WIND WATCH). However, further drying Wednesday morning into
the afternoon and continuing gusty and potentially damaging winds
will potentially support 6 hours or more of critical fire weather
conditions during the watch period.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY MORNING THROUGH
WEDNESDAY EVENING FOR GUSTY NORTHEAST WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE
HUMIDITY FOR VENTURA COUNTY AND WESTERN LOS ANGELES COUNTY...
The National Weather Service in Los Angeles/Oxnard has issued a
Fire Weather Watch FOR GUSTY NORTHEAST WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE
HUMIDITY, which is in effect from Wednesday morning through
Wednesday evening.
* Winds...Damaging northeast winds with gusts peaking at 55 to 75
mph for wind prone mountains. Strongest late Tuesday night
through Wednesday afternoon.
* Relative Humidity...Minimum relative humidity of 10 to 20
percent Wednesday morning and afternoon.
* Impacts...If fire ignition occurs there could be rapid spread of
wildfire that would lead to a threat to life and property.</description>
<instruction>A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are forecast to occur. Listen for later forecasts and possible
Red Flag Warnings.</instruction>
