<instruction>A Winter Weather Advisory for blowing snow means blowing snow
will cause primarily travel difficulties. Expect snow covered
roads and limited visibilities, and use caution while driving.
A Wind Chill Advisory means that cold air and the wind will
combine to create low wind chills. Frostbite and hypothermia can
occur if precautions are not taken. Make sure you wear a hat and
gloves.
