<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY FOR AN ICE JAM NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AKDT
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam release continues.
* WHERE...Yukon River from Galena to Kaltag
* WHEN...Until 600 PM AKDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding is occurring along the Yukon River from
Galena to Kaltag. Water is overbank into low lying areas along
much of the Yukon River. Water may impact fish camps and other
remote cabins along the river. In Galena, several roads are
inundated with water. Sheds and other structures along lakes in
the community are impacted by floodwaters.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 10 AM AKDT, A very large ice jam above Ruby that released
on Sunday continues to send a surge of water and ice
downriver. The large volume of water that was backed up
behind this ice jam will take many days to drain so water
levels on the Yukon will remain high for a number of days.
Water levels have fallen nearly 3 feet in Ruby since Monday
and are starting to crest in Galena Tuesday morning. As the
flood crest moves downriver water levels will increase
between Koyukuk and Kaltag through Wednesday, while
continuing to receded at Galena and Ruby.
- Flooding is not expected in Kaltag due to the higher
elevation above the river.
-
For Yukon River at Ruby:
At 8 am Tuesday the stage was 36.1 feet.
Flood Stage is 40.0 feet.
For Yukon River at Galena:
At 7 am Tuesday the stage was 125.1 feet.
Flood Stage is 124.0 feet.

- If you live near or along the Yukon between Ruby and Kaltag

boats out of low lying areas and store them on higher ground.</description>
