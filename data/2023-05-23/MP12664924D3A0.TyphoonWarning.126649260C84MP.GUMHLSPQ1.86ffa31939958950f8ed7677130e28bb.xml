.STORM INFORMATION...
At 7 PM ChST...the center of Super Typhoon Mawar (02W) was located
near Latitude 12.1N...Longitude 146.3E. This was About 140 miles
southeast of Guam. Storm motion was north-northwest. Storm intensity
was 155 mph.
.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
Mawar continues to intensify on approach to Guam. Passage very near
or directly over Guam as a Category 4 Super Typhoon on Wednesday is
looking increasingly likely. The triple threat of cat 4 typhoon force
winds, torrential rains and life-threatening storm surge are all
expected for Guam. Large storm surge and coastal impacts are likely
to occur, particularly for coastal areas just north of the eye of
Mawar on the east to southeast sides of Guam.
.PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
All preparations for the protection of life and property should now
be complete Stay calm and keep informed. Comply with any evacuation
orders that are issued for your area. If your home is vulnerable to
high winds, or you live in a surge zone or any location prone to
flooding, evacuate to a designated shelter or ride out the storm in
the sturdy fully reinforced concrete home of family or friends
outside of evacuation zones.
For interests at ports, docks and marinas, prescribed preparations
according to your emergency operations plan for tropical cyclones
should now be complete. If you live on a boat, if you haven`t already
done so, make final preparations for securing your craft before
leaving it.
During the storm...stay inside and away from windows. Do not venture
outside when high winds are occurring or during temporary lulls as
flying debris can easily, and suddenly, cause serious injury. If the
eye passes over you, extreme winds will suddenly cease. This is not
the end of the typhoon--REMAIN IN SHELTER as extreme winds will
rapidly resume.
Have a well-charged cell phone nearby, keeping network
communications as open as possible for emergencies.
Once conditions have improved, remain in shelter until the all-clear,
COR 4, is announced from government officials.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for the latest forecasts.
&amp;&amp;
.NEXT UPDATE...
The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather
Service in Tiyan around 3 AM...or sooner if conditions warrant.
...TYPHOON WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IS NOW IN EFFECT...
...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Stay calm and keep informed. Final preparations to protect life and
property should now be complete. If not already completed, rush to
completion the hardening of your home or business by closing
shutters.
Residents should remain in shelter within sturdy concrete homes with
concrete roofs. If you do not live in a concrete structure, evacuate
to a designated shelter or ride out Mawar in the sturdy home of
family or friends outside of evacuation zones. Do so this afternoon.
Comply with any evacuation orders that are issued.
If staying in a home, turn the refrigerator to maximum cold and keep
it closed. Turn off propane tanks and unplug small appliances. Fill
the bathtub with water in case the tap water becomes unavailable
after the storm. This is for cleaning/flushing purposes. Do not
drink it.
During the storm, stay inside and away from windows in a building
with concrete walls and a concrete roof. Stay away from the ocean
due to high surf, strong rip currents and the possibility of storm
surge. Large ships should be secured as they will be torn from
moorings. Do not venture outside when high winds are occurring or
during temporary lulls as flying debris can easily, and
suddenly, cause serious injury.
&amp;&amp;
...Probability of tropical storm/hurricane conditions...
Tropical storm conditions are will arrive later tonight. Typhoon
conditions are a distinct possibility around noontime Wednesday if
Mawar remains a bit farther north than the current forecast track.
...Winds...
Damaging winds (sustained winds of 39 mph or more) will arrive later
tonight into early Wednesday.
There is still a distinct possibility for typhoon force winds. The
most likely timeframe for typhoon force winds would be midday to
afternoon Wednesday. Wind direction is still likely to be northeast,
shifting east to southeast.
Corrugated metal and plywood may be stripped from poorly constructed
buildings and become airborne. Wooden power poles which are rotten or
not reinforced could be tilted or even broken. Poorly constructed
signs could become damaged. Banana, papaya and other similar crops
could topple.
...Storm surge and storm tide...
Storm surge of 2 to 5 feet above the normal high tide is expected as
Mawar passes closer to Guam on Wednesday. Higher surge values around
5 feet would be realized if Mawar passes closer to northern Guam.
Large boats could be torn from moorings. Moderate coastal erosion and
reef damage is likely, particularly along southeast to eastern reefs.
Moderate damage is possible.
Surf continue to build through the night along south and east facing
reefs with dangerous surf of 15 to 25 feet continuing into
Wednesday. Hazardous surf is likely to spread to west facing reefs
Thursday as Mawar moves west into the Philippine Sea.
...Inland flooding...
A Flood Watch is in effect for Rota. See latest forecasts for latest
information. Listen for possible flood warnings for your location
and be ready to act if flooding rains occur.
Heavy rainfall is likely to develop tonight through the next few
days. Torrential rain is quite possible as Mawar passes to the south
closer to Guam. Rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches are possible with
locally higher amounts. A slowing of forward speed and drift farther
north could lead to higher rainfall totals. Monitor conditions for
possible flood advisories or warnings.</description>
