<description>...CAT 4 TYPHOON MAWAR INTENSIFYING AS IT APPROACHES GUAM...
.NEW INFORMATION...
Mawar now a category 4 typhoon.
.AREAS AFFECTED...
This local statement provides important information and recommended
actions for people in Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan. Guam is likely
to see the brunt of the impacts from Mawar.
.Watches/Warnings...
A Typhoon Warning continues for Guam and Rota. Damaging winds of
39 mph are expected late this evening. Typhoon force winds of 74 mph
or greater expected by Wednesday morning.
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Saipan and Tinian.
Damaging winds of 39 mph or greater expected by late tonight.
A Typhoon Watch continues for the Saipan and Tinian. Typhoon
force winds of 74 mph or greater are possible sometime on Wednesday.
A Flood Watch is in effect for Guam and all the Northern Marianas.
Please listen closely for any Flood Warnings that might be in effect
for your area.
.STORM INFORMATION...
At 1 PM ChST...the eye of Typhoon Mawar (02W) was located near
Latitude 11.5N...longitude 146.7E. This was about 190 miles southeast
of Guam. Storm motion was wobbling towards the north to northwest at
roughly 8 mph. Mawar`s intensity was 130 mph sustained winds.
.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
Mawar continues to intensify on approach to Guam. Passage very near
or directly over Guam as a Category 4 typhoon on Wednesday is looking
increasingly likely. The triple threat of cat 4 typhoon force winds,
torrential rains and life-threatening storm surge are all expected
for Guam. Large storm surge and coastal impacts are likely to occur,
particularly for coastal areas just north of the eye of Mawar on the
east to southeast sides of Guam.
.PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
This afternoon is the time to rush to completion preparations for the
protection of life and property. Stay calm and keep informed.
Comply with any evacuation orders that are issued for your area.
If your home is vulnerable to high winds, or you live in a surge
zone or any location prone to flooding, evacuate to a designated
shelter or ride out the storm in the sturdy, fully reinforced
concrete home of family or friends outside of evacuation zones.
For interests at ports...docks...and marinas...urgently complete
prescribed preparations according to your emergency operations
plan for tropical cyclones. If you live on a boat...make final
preparations for securing your craft before leaving it.
During the storm...stay inside and away from windows. Do not venture
outside when high winds are occurring or during temporary lulls as
flying debris can easily...and suddenly...cause serious injury. If
the eye passes over you, extreme winds will suddenly cease. This is
not the end of the typhoon--REMAIN IN SHELTER as extreme winds will
rapidly resume.
Have a well-charged cell phone nearby...keeping network communications
as open as possible for emergencies.
Once conditions have improved, remain in shelter until the all-clear
is announced from government officials.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for the latest forecasts.
&amp;&amp;
.NEXT UPDATE...
The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather
Service in Tiyan around 9 PM...or sooner if conditions warrant.
...TYPHOON WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Stay calm and keep informed. Make the final preparations to protect
life and property. Rush to completion the hardening of your home or
business by closing shutters.
Residents should remain in shelter within sturdy concrete homes with
concrete roofs. If you do not live in a concrete structure, evacuate
to a designated shelter or ride out Mawar in the sturdy home of
family or friends outside of evacuation zones. Do so this afternoon.
Comply with any evacuation orders that are issued.
Items to bring to a shelter include a first aid kit, medicines and
prescriptions, baby food and diapers, games and books, toiletries,
a battery powered radio, a cell phone, flashlights with extra
batteries, a blanket or sleeping bag for each person, personal
identification, copies of key papers such as insurance policies,
available cash and credit cards. Remember, pets are not allowed in
most public shelters, so check ahead with your intended shelter.
If staying in a home, turn the refrigerator to maximum cold and keep
it closed. Turn off propane tanks and unplug small appliances. Fill
the bathtub with water in case the tap water becomes unavailable after
the storm. This is for cleaning/flushing purposes. Do not drink it.
During the storm...stay inside and away from windows in a building
with concrete walls and a concrete roof. Stay away from the ocean
due to high surf, strong rip currents and the possibility of storm
surge. Large ships should be secured as they will be torn from
moorings. Do not venture outside when high winds are occurring or
during temporary lulls as flying debris can easily...and
suddenly...cause serious injury.
&amp;&amp;
...Probability of tropical storm/typhoon conditions...
Tropical storm conditions are expected to arrive late tonight.
Typhoon conditions are a distinct possibility around noontime
Wednesday.
...Winds...
Damaging winds (sustained winds &gt;40 mph) are expected to arrive late
tonight into early Wednesday.
There is still a distinct possibility for typhoon force winds. The
most likely timeframe for typhoon force winds would be midday to
afternoon Wednesday. Wind direction is still likely to be northeast,
shifting east to southeast.
Corrugated metal and plywood may be stripped from poorly constructed
buildings and become airborne. Wooden power poles which are rotten or
not reinforced could be tilted or even broken. Poorly constructed
signs could become damaged. Banana, papaya and other similar crops
could topple.
...Storm surge and storm tide...
Storm surge of 2 to 5 feet above the normal high tide is expected as
Mawar passes closer to Guam on Wednesday. Higher surge values around
5 feet would be realized if Mawar passes closer to northern Guam.
Large boats could be torn from moorings. Moderate coastal erosion and
reef damage is likely, particularly along southeast to eastern reefs.
Moderate damage is possible.
Surf will build sharply this afternoon along south and east facing
reefs with dangerous surf of 15 to 25 feet this afternoon into
Wednesday. Hazardous surf is likely to spread to west facing reefs by
Friday as Mawar moves west into the Philippine Sea.
...Inland flooding...
A Flood Watch is in effect for Rota. See latest forecasts for latest
information. Listen for possible flood warnings for your location
and be ready to act if flooding rains occur.
Heavy rainfall is likely to develop tonight through the next few
days. Torrential rain is quite possible as Mawar passes to the south
closer to Guam. Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches are possible with
locally higher amounts. A slowing of forward speed and drift farther
north could lead to higher rainfall totals. Monitor conditions for
possible flood advisories or warnings.</description>
