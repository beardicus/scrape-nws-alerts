* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Another round of heavy rainfall remains possible across the
watch area this afternoon. While the threat has shifted south
and is more centered across Florida, heavy rainfall remains
possible this afternoon across southeast Alabama and
southwest Georgia. Another round of 1 to 2 inch rainfall
amounts are possible, but localized areas under training
storms could see 3 to 5 inches of rainfall today. If these
higher amounts fall on locations that received heavy rainfall
on Monday, flash flooding could occur more easily.
