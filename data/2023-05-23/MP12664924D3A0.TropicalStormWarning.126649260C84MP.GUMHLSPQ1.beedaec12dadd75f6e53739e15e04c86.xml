Please listen closely for any Flood Warnings that might be in effect
for your area.
Please check the latest public and marine forecasts for detailed
information about additional hazards.
.STORM INFORMATION...
At 7 PM ChST...the center of Super Typhoon Mawar (02W) was located
near Latitude 12.1N...Longitude 146.3E. This was About 140 miles
southeast of Guam. Storm motion was north-northwest. Storm intensity
was 155 mph.
.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
Mawar continues to intensify on approach to Guam. Passage very near
or directly over Guam as a Category 4 Super Typhoon on Wednesday is
looking increasingly likely. The triple threat of cat 4 typhoon force
winds, torrential rains and life-threatening storm surge are all
expected for Guam. Large storm surge and coastal impacts are likely
to occur, particularly for coastal areas just north of the eye of
Mawar on the east to southeast sides of Guam.
.PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
All preparations for the protection of life and property should now
be complete Stay calm and keep informed. Comply with any evacuation
orders that are issued for your area. If your home is vulnerable to
high winds, or you live in a surge zone or any location prone to
flooding, evacuate to a designated shelter or ride out the storm in
the sturdy fully reinforced concrete home of family or friends
outside of evacuation zones.
For interests at ports, docks and marinas, prescribed preparations
according to your emergency operations plan for tropical cyclones
should now be complete. If you live on a boat, if you haven`t already
done so, make final preparations for securing your craft before
leaving it.
During the storm...stay inside and away from windows. Do not venture
outside when high winds are occurring or during temporary lulls as
flying debris can easily, and suddenly, cause serious injury. If the
eye passes over you, extreme winds will suddenly cease. This is not
the end of the typhoon--REMAIN IN SHELTER as extreme winds will
rapidly resume.
Have a well-charged cell phone nearby, keeping network
communications as open as possible for emergencies.
Once conditions have improved, remain in shelter until the all-clear,
COR 4, is announced from government officials.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for the latest forecasts.
&amp;&amp;
.NEXT UPDATE...
The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather
Service in Tiyan around 3 AM...or sooner if conditions warrant.
...TROPICAL STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...TYPHOON WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IS NOW IN EFFECT...
...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Preparations for the protection of life and property should. Stay
calm and keep informed. Comply with any evacuation orders. If your
home is vulnerable to high winds, evacuate to a designated shelter or
ride out the storm in the sturdy home of family or friends outside
of evacuation zones.
Regarding your home or business, cover all windows and doors with
shutters or plywood. Patio furniture and other loose objects should
now be indoors. Brace all exterior doors.
&amp;&amp;
...Probability of tropical storm/hurricane conditions...
The most likely onset of tropical storm conditions is Wednesday
morning. Typhoon force winds are still possible the second half of
Wednesday if there is a slight northward jog of Mawar.
...Winds...
East to northeast winds will increase tonight, becoming damaging
Wednesday morning in the 30 to 40 mph with gusts to 55 mph or so.
Higher winds are likely for higher terrain such as Capitol Hill.
Winds are forecast to increase further Wednesday afternoon as they
shift to an easterly then southeasterly direction. Typhoon conditions
are still possible for Wednesday afternoon, but this hinges on a
northward drift with Mawar.
Residents should move loose items indoors, such as garbage cans and
outdoor furniture, as they will be blown around. Isolated power
outages are possible. Corrugated metal and plywood could be stripped
from poorly constructed homes. Wooden power poles could be tilted.
Poorly constructed signs could be damaged. Banana, papaya and fleshy
crops could see damage.
...Storm surge and storm tide...
Storm surge of 1 to 3 ft above the normal high tide is along south
and eastern shores. Coastal erosion is possible but not expected to
be significant. There could be minor to moderate pier damage for
coastal areas exposed to the south and east. Large boats could be
torn from moorings. Moderate damage is possible.
Surf will build sharply today along south and east facing reefs with
dangerous surf of 8 to 15 feet building to 15 to to 20 feet
early Wednesday. Hazardous surf is likely to spread to west facing
reefs Friday as Mawar moves west into the Philippine Sea.
...Inland flooding...
A Flood Watch is in effect for Saipan and Tinian. Listen for possible
flood warnings...and be ready to act if flooding rains occur.
Heavy rainfall is possible tonight through Wednesday night with
rainfall amounts of 2 to 5 inches. If Mawar shifts a bit farther
north, rainfall amounts could rise to between 5 and 8 inches.</description>
