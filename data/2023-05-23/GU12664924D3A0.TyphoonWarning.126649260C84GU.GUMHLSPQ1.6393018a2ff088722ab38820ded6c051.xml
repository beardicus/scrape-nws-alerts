<description>...MAWAR UPGRADED TO SUPER TYPHOON...
.NEW INFORMATION...
Mawar upgraded to Super Typhoon. A Coastal Flood Warning is now in
effect.
.AREAS AFFECTED...
This local statement provides important information and recommended
actions for people in Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan. Guam is likely
to see the brunt of the impacts from Mawar.
.Watches/Warnings...
A Typhoon Warning continues for the following locations, Guam and
Rota. Damaging winds of 39 mph are expected later this evening.
Typhoon force winds of 74 mph or greater expected by Wednesday
morning.
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Saipan and Tinian.
Damaging winds of 39 mph or greater expected by late tonight.
A Typhoon Watch continues for the Saipan and Tinian. Typhoon
force winds of 74 mph or greater are possible if Mawar turns more
toward the north.
A Flood Watch is in effect for all of Guam and the Northern Marianas.
Please listen closely for any Flood Warnings that might be in effect
for your area.
Please check the latest public and marine forecasts for detailed
information about additional hazards.
.STORM INFORMATION...
At 7 PM ChST...the center of Super Typhoon Mawar (02W) was located
near Latitude 12.1N...Longitude 146.3E. This was About 140 miles
southeast of Guam. Storm motion was north-northwest. Storm intensity
was 155 mph.
.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
Mawar continues to intensify on approach to Guam. Passage very near
or directly over Guam as a Category 4 Super Typhoon on Wednesday is
looking increasingly likely. The triple threat of cat 4 typhoon force
winds, torrential rains and life-threatening storm surge are all
expected for Guam. Large storm surge and coastal impacts are likely
to occur, particularly for coastal areas just north of the eye of
Mawar on the east to southeast sides of Guam.
.PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
All preparations for the protection of life and property should now
be complete Stay calm and keep informed. Comply with any evacuation
orders that are issued for your area. If your home is vulnerable to
high winds, or you live in a surge zone or any location prone to
flooding, evacuate to a designated shelter or ride out the storm in
the sturdy fully reinforced concrete home of family or friends
outside of evacuation zones.
For interests at ports, docks and marinas, prescribed preparations
according to your emergency operations plan for tropical cyclones
should now be complete. If you live on a boat, if you haven`t already
done so, make final preparations for securing your craft before
leaving it.
During the storm...stay inside and away from windows. Do not venture
outside when high winds are occurring or during temporary lulls as
flying debris can easily, and suddenly, cause serious injury. If the
eye passes over you, extreme winds will suddenly cease. This is not
the end of the typhoon--REMAIN IN SHELTER as extreme winds will
rapidly resume.
Have a well-charged cell phone nearby, keeping network
communications as open as possible for emergencies.
Once conditions have improved, remain in shelter until the all-clear,
COR 4, is announced from government officials.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for the latest forecasts.
&amp;&amp;
.NEXT UPDATE...
The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather
Service in Tiyan around 3 AM...or sooner if conditions warrant.
...TYPHOON WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IS NOW IN EFFECT...
...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Stay calm and keep informed. Final preparations to protect life and
property should already be complete. If not finished, rush to
completion the hardening of your home or business by closing shutters
and bracing any garage doors.
Residents should remain in shelter within sturdy concrete homes with
concrete roofs. If you do not live in a concrete structure, or you
live in a surge zone or any location prone to flooding, evacuate to a
designated shelter or ride out Mawar in the sturdy home of family or
friends outside of evacuation zones. Do so this afternoon. Comply
with any evacuation orders that are issued.
If staying in a home, turn the refrigerator to maximum cold and keep
it closed. Turn off propane tanks and unplug small appliances. Fill
the bathtub with water in case the tap water becomes unavailable
after the storm. This is for cleaning/flushing purposes. Do not
drink it.
During the storm, stay inside and away from windows in a building
with concrete walls and a concrete roof. Residents must avoid power
lines as they will be tilted or broken. Stay away from the ocean due
to storm surge. Large ships should be secured as they will be torn
from moorings. Do not venture outside when high winds are occurring
or during temporary lulls as flying debris can easily, and
suddenly, cause serious injury. If the eye passes overhead, DO NOT GO
OUTSIDE!!! Extreme winds will rapidly return.
Once conditions have improved on Thursday, remain in shelter until
the all-clear, Cor 4, is given by government officials.
&amp;&amp;
...Probability of tropical storm/hurricane conditions...
Tropical storm conditions will arrive later tonight. Typhoon
conditions are most likely to begin Wednesday morning into midday.
Intense eyewall winds are expected around noontime.
...Winds...
Damaging winds (sustained winds &gt;40 mph) are expected to arrive this
evening, possibly late evening.
The latest forecast is for typhoon force winds (winds 74 mph or
greater) to move in Wednesday morning increasing through the morning
to around a peak of 155 mph near the eye wall. Gusts could reach to
around 170 mph or up to 190 mph near the eye wall. Exposed, higher
terrain of the island is likely to experience higher winds. Wind
direction at any point on Guam is highly dependent on the exact track
of the eye. A direct passage over the island would lead to major
typhoon force winds from a mix of directions. A passage just south
of Guam would favor major typhoon force north to northeast winds
shifting east and then southeast to south. A passage just north of
Guam would favor major typhoon force winds from the northeast to
west, then southwest to west. Typhoon force winds will extend
outward from the center roughly 30 miles.
Mawar is likely to bring considerable damage to buildings and homes
of light material. Extensive damage to non-concrete roof. Non-
reinforced concrete walls could be blown down. Severe damage to
well-built wooden and metal structures possible. Some reinforced
hollow-spun concrete power poles and many reinforced wooden power
poles could be downed. Solar panels could be damaged. Large
projectiles and debris are possible. Most small and medium sized
steel frame signs could be bent over or damaged. Some fuel storage
tanks could rupture. Cars and high paneled vehicles could be
overturned. Major damage to shrubbery and trees is likely with
snapped or uprooted trees and blocked roads. Defoliation of
vegetation is likely, perhaps 50-70% defoliation.
Electricity and water may be unavailable for days and perhaps weeks
after the storm passes. Most trees will be snapped or uprooted.
Fallen trees may cut off residential areas for days to weeks.
...Storm surge and storm tide...
Storm surge of 6 to 10 feet above the normal high tide is expected
as Mawar moves overhead on Wednesday. Surge may reach to between 20
and 25 feet above normal high tide for the most vulnerable storm
surge prone areas near the eye wall, just north of Mawar`s eye.
Mawar`s angle of approach could lead to considerable coastal impacts
and surge for Malesso, Inalahan, Ipan and Pago Bay, especially if the
center of Mawar scrapes by just south of Guam. Coastal roads of Guam
around Inalahan and Malesso may be impassable due to lofted beach
debris and boulders if this southern track is realized. Surge of 1 to
3 feet is possible within Apra Harbor. Surge may reach 4 feet along
western shores when Mawar passes over Guam.
Severe coastal erosion is likely. Large boats could be torn from
moorings. Moderate to extensive damage is possible. A passage over
or just north of Guam would lead to greater impacts for western
coastlines.
Surf built sharply this afternoon and evening along south and east
facing reefs, with dangerous surf of 20 to 30 feet possible late
tonight into Wednesday. Rough surf may develop along west facing
reefs as early as Wednesday night, with hazardous surf by late
Thursday or Friday.
...Inland flooding...
A Flood Watch is in effect for the entire area. See latest forecast
for latest information. Listen for possible flood warnings for your
location and be ready to act if flooding rains occur.
Heavy rainfall is likely to develop tonight through the next few
days. Torrential rain is likely as Mawar passes near or overhead.
Rainfall amounts of 10 to 15 inches are possible with locally higher
amounts of 20 inches or more. Landslides are a distinct possibility
for central to southern Guam along with overflowing streams and
rivers. A slowing of forward speed could lead to higher rainfall
totals. Monitor conditions for possible flood advisories or warnings.</description>
