<description>...FLOOD WARNING FOR SNOWMELT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON AKDT
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by snowmelt continues.
* WHERE...The Yukon and Porcupine River at Fort Yukon
* WHEN...Until noon AKDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...The runway is now cutoff from the terminal due to water
over the ramp and planes are unable to taxi to the terminal. High
water is impacting the road by the Voc-Ed building and flooding
portions of 4th, 6th, and 7th Ave. Several residences in low-lying
areas have flooded. There is also water around the north end of
the runway. The road east of the Tribal Hall has been breached to
reduce water levels and allow water to flow back towards the Yukon
River.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 200 PM AKDT, water levels continue to slowly rise as
runoff from snowmelt is sending a large volume of water down
tributaries feeding the Porcupine River. Water levels will
continue to rise or remain steady for the next several days.

- If you live near or along the Yukon or Porcupine River at Fort
Yukon stay alert and be prepared to take action.</description>
