<description>...CAT 4 TYPHOON MAWAR INTENSIFYING AS IT APPROACHES GUAM...
.NEW INFORMATION...
Mawar now a category 4 typhoon.
.AREAS AFFECTED...
This local statement provides important information and recommended
actions for people in Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan. Guam is likely
to see the brunt of the impacts from Mawar.
.Watches/Warnings...
A Typhoon Warning continues for Guam and Rota. Damaging winds of
39 mph are expected late this evening. Typhoon force winds of 74 mph
or greater expected by Wednesday morning.
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Saipan and Tinian.
Damaging winds of 39 mph or greater expected by late tonight.
A Typhoon Watch continues for the Saipan and Tinian. Typhoon
force winds of 74 mph or greater are possible sometime on Wednesday.
A Flood Watch is in effect for Guam and all the Northern Marianas.
Please listen closely for any Flood Warnings that might be in effect
for your area.
.STORM INFORMATION...
At 1 PM ChST...the eye of Typhoon Mawar (02W) was located near
Latitude 11.5N...longitude 146.7E. This was about 190 miles southeast
of Guam. Storm motion was wobbling towards the north to northwest at
roughly 8 mph. Mawar`s intensity was 130 mph sustained winds.
.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
Mawar continues to intensify on approach to Guam. Passage very near
or directly over Guam as a Category 4 typhoon on Wednesday is looking
increasingly likely. The triple threat of cat 4 typhoon force winds,
torrential rains and life-threatening storm surge are all expected
for Guam. Large storm surge and coastal impacts are likely to occur,
particularly for coastal areas just north of the eye of Mawar on the
east to southeast sides of Guam.
.PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
This afternoon is the time to rush to completion preparations for the
protection of life and property. Stay calm and keep informed.
Comply with any evacuation orders that are issued for your area.
If your home is vulnerable to high winds, or you live in a surge
zone or any location prone to flooding, evacuate to a designated
shelter or ride out the storm in the sturdy, fully reinforced
concrete home of family or friends outside of evacuation zones.
For interests at ports...docks...and marinas...urgently complete
prescribed preparations according to your emergency operations
plan for tropical cyclones. If you live on a boat...make final
preparations for securing your craft before leaving it.
During the storm...stay inside and away from windows. Do not venture
outside when high winds are occurring or during temporary lulls as
flying debris can easily...and suddenly...cause serious injury. If
the eye passes over you, extreme winds will suddenly cease. This is
not the end of the typhoon--REMAIN IN SHELTER as extreme winds will
rapidly resume.
Have a well-charged cell phone nearby...keeping network communications
as open as possible for emergencies.
Once conditions have improved, remain in shelter until the all-clear
is announced from government officials.
Closely monitor NOAA weather radio or other local news outlets for
official storm information. Listen for the latest forecasts.
&amp;&amp;
.NEXT UPDATE...
The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather
Service in Tiyan around 9 PM...or sooner if conditions warrant.
...TROPICAL STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...TYPHOON WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...New Information...
Mawar now a category 4 typhoon. Confidence has increased in a
passage closer to Guam but a slight northward jog may still bring
typhoon conditions to Tinian and Saipan.
...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Now is the time to rush to completion preparations for the
protection of life and property. Stay calm and keep informed. Comply
with any evacuation orders. If your home is vulnerable to high
winds, evacuate to a designated shelter or ride out the storm in the
sturdy home of family or friends outside of evacuation zones.
Items to bring to a shelter include a first aid kit, medicines and
prescriptions, baby food and diapers, games and books, toiletries,
a battery powered radio, a cell phone, flashlights with extra
batteries, a blanket or sleeping bag for each person, personal
identification, copies of key papers such as insurance policies,
available cash and credit cards. Remember, pets are not allowed in
most public shelters, so check ahead with your intended shelter.
Regarding your home or business, cover all windows and doors with
shutters or plywood. Move patio furniture and other loose objects
indoors. Brace all exterior doors. Do this today.
&amp;&amp;
...Probability of tropical storm/typhoon conditions...
The most likely onset of tropical storm conditions is Wednesday
morning. Typhoon force winds are still possible the second half of
Wednesday if there is a slight northward jog of Mawar.
...Winds...
East to northeast winds will increase tonight, becoming damaging
Wednesday morning in the 30 to 40 mph with gusts to 55 mph or so.
Higher winds are likely for higher terrain such as Capitol Hill.
Winds are forecast to increase further Wednesday afternoon as they
shift to an easterly then southeasterly direction. Typhoon conditions
are still possible for Wednesday afternoon, but this hinges on a
northward drift with Mawar.
Residents should move loose items indoors, such as garbage cans and
outdoor furniture, as they will be blown around. Isolated power
outages are possible. Corrugated metal and plywood could be stripped
from poorly constructed homes. Wooden power poles could be tilted.
Poorly constructed signs could be damaged. Banana, papaya and fleshy
crops could see damage.
...Storm surge and storm tide...
Storm surge of 1 to 3 ft above the normal high tide is along south
and eastern shores. Coastal erosion is possible but not expected to
be significant. There could be minor to moderate pier damage for
coastal areas exposed to the south and east. Large boats could be
torn from moorings. Moderate damage is possible.
Surf will build sharply today along south and east facing reefs with
dangerous surf of 8 to 15 feet building to 15 to to 20 feet
early Wednesday. Hazardous surf is likely to spread to west facing
reefs Friday as Mawar moves west into the Philippine Sea.
...Inland flooding...
A Flood Watch is in effect for Saipan and Tinian. Listen for possible
flood warnings...and be ready to act if flooding rains occur.
Heavy rainfall is possible tonight through Wednesday night with
rainfall amounts of 2 to 5 inches. If Mawar shifts a bit farther
north, rainfall amounts could rise to between 5 and 8 inches.</description>
