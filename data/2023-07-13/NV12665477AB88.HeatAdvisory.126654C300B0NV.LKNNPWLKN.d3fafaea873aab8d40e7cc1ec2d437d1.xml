<headline>Heat Advisory issued July 13 at 2:30AM PDT until July 17 at 8:00PM PDT by NWS Elko</headline>
<description>...HEAT ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM SUNDAY TO 8 PM PDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Dangerously hot conditions with high temperatures above
100 degrees in valleys.
* WHERE...Southwest Elko County.
* WHEN...From Saturday morning through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...Extreme heat will significantly increase the
potential for heat related illnesses, particularly for those
working or participating in outdoor activities.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Overnight temperatures will remain quite
warm in the mid 60s to upper 70s or about 12 to 17 degrees
warmer than average. These overnight lows offer little to no
relief from the daytime heat.</description>
<instruction>Monitor the latest forecasts and warnings for updates on this
situation. Be prepared to drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-
conditioned room, stay out of the sun, and check up on relatives
and neighbors.
Young children and pets should never be left unattended in
vehicles under any circumstances. This is especially true during
warm or hot weather when car interiors can reach lethal
temperatures in a matter of minutes.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible...reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear light weight and loose fitting clothing when
possible and drink plenty of water.
to reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent rest breaks
in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone overcome by
heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location. Heat stroke
is an emergency - call 911.</instruction>
