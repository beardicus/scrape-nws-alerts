Intense thunderstorm lines can produce brief tornadoes and widespread
significant wind damage. Although a tornado is not immediately

a building. This storm may cause serious injury and significant
property damage.
Large hail and damaging winds and continuous cloud to ground
lightning is occurring with this storm. Move indoors immediately.
Lightning is one of nature`s leading killers. Remember, if you can
hear thunder, you are close enough to be struck by lightning.
Torrential rainfall is occurring with this storm, and may lead to
flash flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flooded roadways.</instruction>
