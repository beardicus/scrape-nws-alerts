<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued July 13 at 9:22PM EDT until July 14 at 3:15AM EDT by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Gray has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
Southwestern Sullivan County in central New Hampshire...
Western Cheshire County in southern New Hampshire...
* Until 315 AM EDT.
* At 922 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing
heavy rain across the warned area. The expected rainfall rate is 2
to 4 inches in 1 hour. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to
begin shortly.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban
areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as
other poor drainage and low-lying areas.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Keene, Swanzey, Charlestown, Winchester, Richmond, Nelson, Surry,
Gilsum and Westmoreland.
Due to recent flash flood damage the warned area is already quite
vulnerable to additional flooding. With expected rainfall rates
greater than 2 inches per hour renewed flash flooding is likely.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
