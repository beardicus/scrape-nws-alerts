<headline>Air Quality Alert issued July 13 at 11:10AM EDT  by NWS Albany</headline>
<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation at
Albany has issued a Air Quality Health Advisory for Ground Level
Ozone...until 11 PM EDT this evening.
Air quality levels in outdoor air are predicted to be greater than
an air quality index value of 100 for Ground Level Ozone. The air
quality index...or AQI...was created as an easy way to correlate
levels of different pollutants to one scale. The higher the AQI
value, the greater the health concern.
When pollution levels are elevated...the New York State Department
of Health recommends that individuals consider limiting strenuous
outdoor physical activity to reduce the risk of adverse health
effects. People who may be especially sensitive to the effects of
elevated levels of pollutants include the very young and those with
pre existing respiratory problems such as asthma or heart disease.
Those with symptoms should consider consulting their personal
physician.
For additional information, please visit the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation website at,
https://on.ny.gov/nyaqi, or call the Air Quality Hotline at 800-535-
1345.</description>
