<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of central and southern New Hampshire, including
the following counties, in central New Hampshire, Sullivan. In
southern New Hampshire, Cheshire.
* WHEN...Through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Low pressure will bring periods of heavy rain and some
thunderstorms to the forecast area today. Excessive runoff may
result in flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations. Smaller creeks and streams may rise out
of their banks. Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban
areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...

Highest amounts are expected in the mountains. However, south
of the mountains, slower moving showers and thunderstorms may
develop and also pose a risk for flash flooding, especially
in normally prone urban areas. Hikers and campers should keep
a close eye on the weather and be alert to any subsequent
statements or warnings.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action
should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.</instruction>
