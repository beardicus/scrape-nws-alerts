<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues to be possible.
* WHERE...The Tanana River at Manley Hot Springs
* WHEN...Through Sunday morning.
* IMPACTS...Ice jam flooding is possible and has a high uncertainty.
Impacts could range between localized high water or significant
flooding. Large chunks of ice could push overbank along the Tanana
River.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Ice shifted and moved at Manley Hot Springs on Thursday
afternoon and water levels continue to rise. River observer
reports and satellite imagery indicate somewhat hard and
intact ice is still in place on the Tanana River below Manley
Hot Springs and downriver to the Yukon River. There is the
possibility of ice jams forming as the breakup front moves
past a known jam point about 12 miles below Manley Hot
Springs.

stay alert and be prepared to take action. Where possible, move
items to higher ground and prepare for possible flooding.</description>
