<description>...Minor Ice Shoves Strong winds and Heavy Rain Possible This
Weekend and Next Week...
A strong front moving east out of the Bering Sea will stall over
the area this weekend and into early next week. This front is
expected to bring strong southerly winds and the potential for
minor ice shoves along the Northern Coast of Norton Sound over the
weekend. In addition, heavy rain is expected especially along the
south facing slopes of the Seward Peninsula through the weekend
and into early next week. The heavy rain combined with an above
normal snowpack over higher elevations, will cause a significant
increase in snowmelt. Runoff into rivers along the south facing
slopes of the Seward Peninsula over the weekend and early next
week will cause water levels to rise and the potential to start
the breakup process on many rivers. Local ice jam may form and
result in elevated water levels. The increased runoff may also
cause smaller streams and creeks to rise to bankfull levels or
overbank in low lying areas.
People along rivers and streams along the West Coast should
prepare for the possibility of high water levels this week and
next week due to potential ice breakup and snowmelt runoff. People
along the Northern Coast of the Seward Peninsula should be
prepared for minor ice shoves this weekend.</description>
