<description>...SNOW AHEAD FOR THE PANHANDLES...
An upper level winter system is expected to track from
southeastern Utah tomorrow afternoon to across the southern Texas
Panhandle Wednesday.
A few flurries may occur in the Oklahoma Panhandle late Tuesday
afternoon. Light snow will then shift south through remainder of
the Panhandles Tuesday evening into Wednesday afternoon, with the
height of the snow expected late Tuesday night into Wednesday
morning. Light snowfall accumulations of around one to three
inches are expected across the southwestern two thirds of the
Texas Panhandle and extreme western Oklahoma Panhandle, but there
could be a corridor of around three to four inches in the
southwest Texas Panhandle, with around a Romero to Boys Ranch
axis currently favored for this possibility.
The snowfall may reduce visibilities at times and may cause snow-
packed and icy roads. With precipitation chances in the 60 to 80
percent range early Wednesday morning, there`s a very good chance
that the Wednesday morning commute will be impacted by snow,
particularly in the southwestern and central Texas Panhandle.
Stay tuned to the developments of this winter system by visiting
