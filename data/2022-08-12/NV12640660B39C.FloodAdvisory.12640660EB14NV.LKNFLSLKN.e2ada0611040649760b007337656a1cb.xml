<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 12 at 8:03PM PDT  by NWS Elko</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM PDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of northeast Nevada, including the following
counties, Elko and White Pine.
* WHEN...Until 1100 PM PDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 803 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms. Minor flooding is ongoing or expected to begin
shortly in the advisory area. Heavy rain is around or over
the Becky Peak Burn scar.
- These storms are slow moving and may stay over the same areas
for an extended period of time, leading to localized
flooding.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
mainly rural areas of Southeastern Elko and Northeastern
White Pine Counties
- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.</instruction>
