<description>The National Weather Service in Las Vegas has extended the
* Flash Flood Warning for...
Southeastern San Bernardino County in southern California...
* Until 1215 AM PDT.
* At 1108 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing
heavy rain in the Ludlow area, along and south of the Interstate
40 corridor including Amboy Road south of Amboy. Between 1.5 and
2.5 inches of rain have fallen according to radar estimates.
Additional rainfall amounts of 0.1 to 0.25 inches are possible as
most rainfall is light to moderate in these areas. As rainfall
continues in these areas, any ongoing flooding is expected to
continue at least for another hour.

and excessive runoff.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Life-threatening flash flooding of low-water
crossings, creeks, normally dry washes and roads.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Ludlow and Amboy including Amboy Road.
Amboy Road south of Amboy to Twentynine Palms is likely seeing
significant flooding across it in multiple locations as very heavy
rainfall rates have been recorded on radar. At least one instance of
a stuck vehicle has been reported along Amboy Road. It is advised to
find an alternate route and avoid this roadway.
