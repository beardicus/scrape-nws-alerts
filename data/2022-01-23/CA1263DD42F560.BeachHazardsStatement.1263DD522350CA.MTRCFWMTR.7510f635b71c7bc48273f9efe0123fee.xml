<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued January 23 at 1:52PM PST until January 24 at 1:00PM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>...LONG PERIOD NORTHWEST SWELL WILL BRING RISK OF SNEAKER WAVES
TO BEACHES THIS AFTERNOON UNTIL MIDDAY MONDAY...
.A northwest swell train is forecast to approach the coast midday
today and bring an increased risk of sneaker waves to area
beaches. Initial forerunner waves of 1 to 2 feet at 21 to
22 seconds are possible through the morning, but the main risk
will arrive with the 3 to 6 foot waves at 17 to 20 seconds this
afternoon into Monday morning. A beach hazard statement for
sneaker waves is issued when the ocean state features a
deceptively calm ocean with long lulls between large waves
capable of knocking unsuspecting beachgoers off of coastal rocks,
jetties, and outcroppings into the cold, restless ocean.
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Northwest swell of 3 to 6 feet at 17 to 20 seconds will
bring an increased risk of sneaker waves to area beaches.
* WHERE...Coastal North Bay Including Point Reyes National
Seashore, Southern Monterey Bay and Big Sur Coast, San
Francisco Peninsula Coast, San Francisco and Northern Monterey
Bay.
* WHEN...From 1 PM PST this afternoon through Monday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Risk of sneaker waves and strong rip currents.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Long lulls are typical between hazardous
sneakers waves and the ocean may appear relatively calm for up
to 30 minutes between larger waves.</description>
<instruction>A Beach Hazard Statement for sneaker waves means that conditions
are present to support a heightened risk of unsuspecting beach
goers being swept into the sea by a wave. People walking along the
beach should never turn their back to the sea. Fisherman should
avoid fishing from rocks or jetties.</instruction>
