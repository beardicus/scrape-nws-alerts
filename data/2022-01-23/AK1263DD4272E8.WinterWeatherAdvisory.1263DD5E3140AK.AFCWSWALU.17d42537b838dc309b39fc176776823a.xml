<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 23 at 9:18AM AKST until January 24 at 3:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 3 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO
3 PM AKST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected, possibly mixed with sleet and freezing
rain. Total snow accumulations of 2 to 10 inches and ice
accumulations of a light glaze. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Kuskokwim Delta.
* WHEN...From 3 PM this afternoon to 3 PM AKST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow and areas of blowing snow are expected
to develop Sunday afternoon as a low pressure system moves in
from the south. Warmer air will move over the eastern half of
the Kuskokwim Delta by early morning Monday, with snow changing
to a wintry mix and eventually to all rain for areas east of
Bethel. The precipitation is expected to remain all snow for
areas for locations west of Bethel, as colder air will remain
along the Kuskokwim Delta coast. The highest snow totals are
expected near the coast, where 6 to 10 inches is possible. 2 to
4 inches of snow, along with a light glaze of ice, is possible
farther east, where the snow will transition to a wintry mix.
The precipitation will transition to all snow by Monday
afternoon before tapering off from west to east.</description>
