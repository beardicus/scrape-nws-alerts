Greater Portland Metro Area.
* WHEN...For the Air Stagnation Advisory, until 4 PM PST

* IMPACTS...Hazardous driving conditions due to low visibility in

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Poor air quality may cause issues for
people with respiratory problems. Local jurisdictions may have
wood burning restrictions in place. Check with your county or

<instruction>If driving, slow down, use your headlights, and leave plenty of
distance ahead of you.
People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with high levels of air pollution during
periods of stagnant air.
State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor
burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be
limited as much as possible. According to state air quality
agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants
close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with
your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
