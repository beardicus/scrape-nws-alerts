<description>...Slow Moving Band Of Moderate Snow And Reduced Visibility...
A slow moving band of moderate to briefly heavy snow and reduced
visibility will continue across portions of northeast New York and
the northwest and north central sections of Vermont through 400
pm.
Areas most likely to see this band of snow produce an inch or less
of snow in a short period of time and visibility reduced under a
mile include northeast Essex County and southeast Clinton County
in New York as well as Chittenden, Lamoille, Addison, and
Washington counties in Vermont. The band has produced visibility
as low as a quarter mile and up to a half inch of snow in a short
period of time.
Precautionary/Preparedness Actions...
Remember conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather
situations. Be prepared for snow covered roads and reduced
visibilities. Slow down and allow extra time when traveling.</description>
