<description>...Band Of Moderate Snow And Reduced Visibility Continues...
A slow moving band of moderate snow and reduced visibility will
continue across portions of Essex County New York and the
northwest and central portions of Vermont through 600 pm.
Areas most likely to see this band of snow produce an inch or
less of snow in a short period of time and visibility reduced
under a mile include eastern Essex County in New York as well as
Chittenden, Lamoille, Addison, Washington, and Orange counties in
Vermont. The band of snow has produced visibility as low as a
quarter mile and up to a half inch of snow in a short period of
time.
Precautionary/Preparedness Actions...
Remember conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather
situations. Be prepared for snow covered roads and reduced
visibilities. Slow down and allow extra time when traveling.</description>
