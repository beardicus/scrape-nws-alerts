<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued April 04 at 3:55AM CDT until April 06 at 1:00AM CDT by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...COMPLEX PROLONGED WINTER STORM TO BRING MULTIPLE PRECIPITATION
TYPES AND BLOWING SNOW ACROSS PORTIONS OF WESTERN AND CENTRAL
MINNESOTA THROUGH WEDNESDAY...
.A strengthening weather system will impact the area beginning
this morning in western Minnesota, spreading north and eastwards
throughout the day and into Wednesday. Snow will be the initial
precipitation type, with snow eventually becoming mixed with
sleet, freezing rain, and rain depending on the area. Winds will
increase significantly later today and even more so on Wednesday,
resulting in significant visibility reductions and areas of
blowing snow at times, mainly in western Minnesota. Ice
accumulations coupled with strengthening winds could also result
in falling tree branches or power lines.
A Winter Storm Warning remains in effect starting at 6AM for
Stevens, Douglas and Todd counties where the combination of
falling snow, ice, sleet, and winds will produce the greatest
overall impacts to travel and infrastructure. A Winter Weather
Advisory remains in effect east of the Warning for areas along
and west of a line from Redwood Falls to St Cloud to Mora, where
more mixed precipitation and lower overall accumulation will
still be impacted by the combination of wintry precipitation and
winds.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM THIS MORNING
TO 1 AM CDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow accumulations of
1 to 3 inches and ice accumulations of up to one tenth of an
inch. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Yellow Medicine, Renville and Redwood Counties.
* WHEN...From 9 AM this morning to 1 AM CDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute. Gusty
winds could bring down tree branches.</description>
