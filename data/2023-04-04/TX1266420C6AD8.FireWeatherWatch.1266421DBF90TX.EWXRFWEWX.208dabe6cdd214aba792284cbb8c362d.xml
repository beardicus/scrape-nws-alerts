<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued April 04 at 2:42AM CDT until April 05 at 4:00PM CDT by NWS Austin-San Antonio</headline>
<description>...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS EXPECTED OVER VAL VERDE
COUNTY ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON, AND MOST OF SOUTH-CENTRAL TEXAS
WEDNESDAY MORNING AND AFTERNOON...
Very dry air will filter into portions of the southern Edwards
Plateau this afternoon, with humidity values in the single digits
and lower teens currently forecast for Val Verde County. Combined
with afternoon winds of 20 to 30 mph possibly gusting to 40 mph,
dry to critically dry fuels all allow for the efficient spread of
fires. A Red Flag Warning has been issued, effective from 1-7 PM
CDT for Val Verde County.
A cold front will push in from the northwest late tonight into
Wednesday morning. Very dry air will overspread the region behind
the boundary, with widespread relative humidities in the teens and
single digits forecast along and west of the Interstate 35
Corridor. Combined with sustained north winds ranging from 15 to
25 MPH, and dry to critically dry fuels, this will promote
additional critical fire weather conditions across this portion of
South-Central Texas. A Fire Weather Watch has been issued for all
counties along and west of I-35, effective from 4 AM to 4 PM CDT
Wednesday. Avoid any activities that could inadvertently promote
the ignition and spread of wildfires on both Tuesday and
Wednesday.

7 PM CDT THIS EVENING FOR WIND AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR VAL
VERDE COUNTY...
