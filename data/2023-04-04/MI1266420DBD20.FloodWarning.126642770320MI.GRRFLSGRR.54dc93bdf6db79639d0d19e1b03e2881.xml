<headline>Flood Warning issued April 04 at 12:08PM EDT until April 11 at 2:00AM EDT by NWS Grand Rapids</headline>

Michigan...
Grand River near Comstock Park affecting Kent County.
Red Cedar River At East Lansing affecting Ingham County.

.Another 0.5 to 1.0 inches of rain fell overnight, which is mostly
prolonging the expected flood crests, but not making them
significantly worse. Unfortunately, several rounds of thunderstorms
expected tonight and tomorrow will add additional water into the
system, which could push these crests higher and potentially bring
additional locations above flood levels.

- Recent Activity...The maximum river stage in the 24 hours
