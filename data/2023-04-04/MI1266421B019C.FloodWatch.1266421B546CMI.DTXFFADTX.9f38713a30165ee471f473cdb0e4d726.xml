* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall remains possible.
* WHERE...A portion of southeast Michigan, including the following

* WHEN...Until 10 AM EDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Area creeks and
streams are running high and could flood with more heavy rain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...

soils from recent rainfalls over the last few days may lead
to flooding across parts of the area.
