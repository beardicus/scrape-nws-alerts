<headline>Flood Warning issued April 04 at 12:08PM EDT until April 07 at 2:00AM EDT by NWS Grand Rapids</headline>

Michigan...
Grand River near Comstock Park affecting Kent County.
Red Cedar River At East Lansing affecting Ingham County.

.Another 0.5 to 1.0 inches of rain fell overnight, which is mostly
prolonging the expected flood crests, but not making them
significantly worse. Unfortunately, several rounds of thunderstorms
expected tonight and tomorrow will add additional water into the
system, which could push these crests higher and potentially bring
additional locations above flood levels.

* WHERE...Red Cedar River At East Lansing.
* WHEN...Until early Friday morning.
* IMPACTS...At 7.0 feet, Expect minor flooding of low lying areas,
adjacent parks, and farmland.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 11:30 AM EDT Tuesday the stage was 6.9 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above flood stage
this evening to a crest of 7.1 feet just after midnight
tonight. It will then fall below flood stage early Thursday
afternoon.
- Flood stage is 7.0 feet.
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
7.2 feet on 08/13/2021.
