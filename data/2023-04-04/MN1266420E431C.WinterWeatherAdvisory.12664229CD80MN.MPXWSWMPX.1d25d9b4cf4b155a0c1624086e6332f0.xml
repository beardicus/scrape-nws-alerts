<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued April 04 at 2:51PM CDT until April 05 at 7:00PM CDT by NWS Minneapolis</headline>
<description>...CONTINUED LIGHT WINTRY PRECIPITATION WILL RESULT IN SLICK
TRAVEL CONDITIONS OVERNIGHT AND INTO WEDNESDAY...
.Our first major round of precipitation has ended, with the snow
that fell in western Minnesota followed by freezing drizzle
resulting in a lack of blowable snow. A wintry mix of snow, sleet,
and freezing rain will continue to be present across much of the
area tonight and into Wednesday, however we will likely be
impacted by a dry slot which will keep accumulations towards the
lower end of the expected ranges. Winds are still expected to
increase tomorrow and through Thursday, however the threat for
blowing snow has diminished and has led to a reduced overall
threat. Icy travel conditions are still likely in areas that see
freezing drizzle/rain overnight, including during the morning
commute tomorrow.
The three counties that were in a Winter Storm Warning have been
downgraded to a Winter Weather Advisory due to a lack of blowable
snow and a reduction in the threat for blowing snow overall. The
Advisory has also been trimmed by 6 hours as precipitation largely
ends by tomorrow evening. The main threat is now considered the
freezing precipitation overnight and the travel impacts through
tomorrow morning`s commute.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM CDT WEDNESDAY...
...WINTER STORM WARNING IS CANCELLED...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation. Additional snow accumulations of 1
to 3 inches and ice accumulations of a light glaze. Winds
gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Douglas, Todd and Stevens Counties.
* WHEN...Until 7 PM CDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Patchy blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute. Gusty
winds could bring down tree branches.</description>
