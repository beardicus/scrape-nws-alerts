<headline>High Surf Advisory issued April 03 at 2:24PM PDT until April 05 at 11:00AM PDT by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY FOR MONDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH TUESDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Large waves and hazardous surf conditions, with high
potential of sneaker waves. Breakers of 18 to 25 feet.
* WHERE...In Oregon, North Oregon Coast and Central Oregon
Coast. In Washington, South Washington Coast.
* WHEN...From noon Monday to 11 AM PDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Destructive waves may wash over beaches, jetties, and
other structures unexpectedly. People can be swept off rocks
and jetties and drown while observing high surf. Minor beach
erosion may damage coastal properties and buildings. Higher than
normal water run-up is expected on beaches and low-lying
shoreline. If you see someone or a pet swept into the sea, do
not swim in after them. Call 911, and keep an eye on them until
help arrives.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Those in and near the surf zone,
especially those digging for razor clams, should remain vigilant
and aware of the ocean and surf.</description>
<instruction>A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches,
producing rip currents, sneaker waves and beach erosion. Stay
well back from the water`s edge and be alert for exceptionally
high waves.
Keep away from large logs on the beach. Water running up on the
beach can easily lift or roll logs which can injure or kill
someone caught in their path.</instruction>
