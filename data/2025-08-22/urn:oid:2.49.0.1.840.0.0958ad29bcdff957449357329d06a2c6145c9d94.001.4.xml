        <headline>Coastal Flood Statement issued August 22 at 5:06PM EDT until August 23 at 1:00PM EDT by NWS Upton NY</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 4
to 7 feet in the surf zone. For the High Rip Current Risk,
dangerous rip currents. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to
one foot of inundation above ground level expected in
vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline. For the
Coastal Flood Statement, up to one half foot of inundation
above ground level expected in vulnerable areas near the
waterfront and shoreline.

* WHERE...Southwest Suffolk and Southern Nassau Counties.

* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Sunday evening.
For the High Surf Advisory, until 4 AM EDT Saturday. For the
Coastal Flood Advisory, until 2 AM EDT Saturday. For the
Coastal Flood Statement, from Saturday morning through
Saturday afternoon.

* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Minor flooding in the more vulnerable
locations near the waterfront and shoreline. Some roads and
low lying properties including parking lots, parks, lawns, and
homes and businesses with basements near the waterfront will
experience minor flooding.

* SWIMMING IMPACTS...Life-threatening swimming and surfing
conditions and localized beach erosion. Life-threatening rip
currents are likely for all people entering the surf zone.
Anyone visiting the beaches should stay out of the surf. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water.

* SHORELINE IMPACTS...Along the ocean front, widespread areas of
dune erosion with localized overwashes are expected during
high tide.

        <instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.

Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.

If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
