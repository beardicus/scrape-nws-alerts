        <headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued August 22 at 5:03PM EDT until August 23 at 1:00AM EDT by NWS Mount Holly NJ</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to one foot of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways. For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous
rip currents. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves
of up to 8 feet in the surf zone.

* WHERE...Eastern Monmouth.

* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 1 AM EDT
Saturday. For the High Rip Current Risk, through Sunday
evening. For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT this
evening.

* IMPACTS...At this level, flooding begins on the most vulnerable
roads in coastal and bayside communities, and along inland tidal
waterways. Some partial or full road closures are possible.
Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach
erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from
shore into deeper water.
</description>
        <instruction>A Coastal Flood Advisory means that minor tidal flooding is
expected. Minor tidal flooding often results in some road
closures. Usually, the most vulnerable roadways will flood.

Do not leave your vehicle at a location that is prone to tidal
flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flood waters. The
water may be deeper than you think it is. You will be putting
yourself in danger and your vehicle may be damaged, leading to
costly repairs.

Visit the Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service at
water.weather.gov/ahps for additional water level and flood
impact information for your local tide gauge.

Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.

Always obey posted Beach Flags. If you enter the surf zone,
always have a floatation device with you and swim near a
lifeguard if possible. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float and do not swim against the current. If able, swim parallel
to the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the shore and call or
wave for help.</instruction>
