        <headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued August 22 at 4:52AM EDT until August 22 at 11:00PM EDT by NWS Mount Holly NJ</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to one foot of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways. For the High Surf Advisory,
large breaking waves of up to 5 feet in the surf zone. For the
High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.

* WHERE...Eastern Monmouth.

* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 11 PM EDT this
evening. For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT this
evening. For the High Rip Current Risk, through Saturday
evening.

* IMPACTS...At this level, flooding begins on the most
vulnerable roads in coastal and bayside communities, and along
inland tidal waterways. Some partial or full road closures are
possible. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
</description>
        <instruction>A Coastal Flood Advisory means that minor tidal flooding is
expected. Minor tidal flooding often results in some road
closures. Usually, the most vulnerable roadways will flood.

Do not leave your vehicle at a location that is prone to tidal
flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flood waters. The
water may be deeper than you think it is. You will be putting
yourself in danger and your vehicle may be damaged, leading to
costly repairs.

Visit the Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service at
water.weather.gov/ahps for additional water level and flood
impact information for your local tide gauge.

Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.

Always obey posted Beach Flags. If you enter the surf zone,
always have a floatation device with you and swim near a
lifeguard if possible. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float and do not swim against the current. If able, swim parallel
to the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the shore and call or
wave for help.</instruction>
