KAUAI OAHU AND MOLOKAI AND FOR NORTH FACING SHORES OF MAUI THROUGH
TONIGHT...
...HIGH SURF WARNING FOR WEST FACING SHORES OF THE BIG ISLAND
THROUGH TONIGHT...
.A large long period northwest swell will peak early this morning,
bringing extra large to giant surf to north and west facing
shores and large surf for Leeward Big Island. The combination of
large wind waves due to strong westerly winds and long-period
swell energy will result in very rough and hazardous conditions
through tonight. The swell will decline and become north northwesterly
Friday through the weekend.
...HIGH SURF WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM HST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Dangerously large breaking waves of 12 to 16 ft.
* WHERE...West facing shores of the Big Island.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM HST Friday.
* IMPACTS...High. Expect very strong breaking waves and powerful
currents. Waves breaking in channel entrances may make
navigating the channels dangerous.</description>
<instruction>Stay away from the shoreline along the affected coasts. Be
prepared for road closures. Postpone entering or leaving channels
affected by the high surf until the surf subsides.</instruction>
