<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 09 at 3:15PM PST until March 12 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 AM PDT
SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow with periods of heavy rain expected. Total
snow accumulations of up to 12 inches, except 2 to 6 feet
above 6500 feet. Winds gusting as high as 60 mph with gusts up
to 120 mph along the Sierra crest.
* WHERE...Greater Lake Tahoe Area.
* WHEN...From 4 PM PST Thursday to 11 AM PDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Very
strong winds combined with heavy snow could cause tree damage
and lead to power outages. Snow loading on structures will
increase due to the additional rain and snow being absorbed
into the deep snowpack, along with higher risks for dangerous
roofalanches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow levels are expected to fluctuate
significantly during the storm, initially starting around 6500
feet, rising to around 8500 tonight, then dropping to 6000-6500
feet Friday night into Saturday. Periods of higher snow levels
Thursday night into Friday brings the risk of flooding in lower
elevations, see the Flood Advisory for more details.</description>
<instruction>Avoid travel if possible, you could be stuck in your vehicle for
many hours. If you must travel, prepare for long delays and carry
an emergency kit with extra food, water and clothing. If you stay
home, have a backup plan in case of power outages.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.
Follow guidance from local officials and building inspectors for
ways to monitor and mitigate the risk of increased snow loads on
roofs.</instruction>
