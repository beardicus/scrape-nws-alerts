<headline>Flood Watch issued March 09 at 2:03AM PST until March 10 at 10:00PM PST by NWS Elko</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Areas of overland flooding or ponding of water/mud on roads
caused by warming temperatures, gusty southwest winds, and
excessive rain on snow is likely. River levels are also expected
to rise and there is an elevated risk for minor river flooding.
* WHERE...A portion of northeast Nevada, including the following
areas, Northern Elko County, Ruby Mountains and East Humboldt
Range, South Central Elko County, Southeastern Elko County and
Southwest Elko County.
* WHEN...From late tonight through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. Storm drains and ditches may
become clogged with debris or ice and snow.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Warm Atmospheric River moisture is expected to reach into
Nevada on Friday through Saturday. This coupled with strong
gusty southwest winds will accelerate snowmelt of the above
normal snowpack in elevations below 8000 feet.
