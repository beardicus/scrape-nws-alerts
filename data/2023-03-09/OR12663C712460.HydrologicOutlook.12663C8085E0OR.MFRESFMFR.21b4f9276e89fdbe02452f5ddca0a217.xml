<description>...Flood Potential Outlook for rain and snow melt flooding on
streams in the following counties.
...Curry, Coos, and Josephine counties in Oregon...
The coming week will be very wet and will be dominated by two
atmospheric river systems that will bring moderate to heavy rain
through the area. The first system will bring an additional 1 to
3 inches of rain this evening through Friday afternoon. The
second system will bring 2 to 5 inches from Sunday into Tuesday.
The snow level will rise briefly during both atmospheric rivers
which means that there will be rain falling on the low to
mid-elevation snow. This could lead to rapid snow melt causing
small stream flooding, standing water in Coos and Curry counties,
and in the Illinois Valley in Josephine County.  This is also
expected to cause rises to near action stage on the Coquille River
at Myrtle Point.
While the threat of small stream flooding may be present as both
systems pass through, the first system has a lower chance as it
may serve more to warm up the snowpack whereas the second system
will be a bit warmer and could cause more widespread impacts
from small stream flooding.
A flood potential outlook is issued when there is the potential
for significant rises or flooding along rivers and streams.
The exact scenario for flooding remains uncertain. This product
will be updated as necessary. Watches and warnings may be issued
by the National Weather Service if this situation worsens.</description>
