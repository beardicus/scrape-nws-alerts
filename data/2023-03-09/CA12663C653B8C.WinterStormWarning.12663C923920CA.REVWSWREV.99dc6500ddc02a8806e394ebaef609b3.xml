<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 09 at 3:15PM PST until March 12 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 AM PDT
SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible above 6500 feet. Total snow
accumulations of 2 to 6 feet above 8500 feet, and 1 to 2 feet
between 7500 and 8500 feet including Mammoth Lakes and June
Lakes. Up to 6 inches down to 6500 feet if snow levels fall
further than anticipated. Winds could gust as high as 120 mph
along the Sierra Crest with up to 60 mph gusts along wind prone
areas of the US-395 corridor.
* WHERE...Mono County.
* WHEN...From 4 PM PST Thursday to 11 AM PDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Very
strong winds combined with heavy snow could cause tree damage
and lead to power outages. Snow loading on structures will
increase due to the additional rain and snow being absorbed
into the deep snowpack, along with higher risks for dangerous
roofalanches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow levels are expected to fluctuate
significantly during the storm, initially starting around 7000
feet, rising to around 8500-9000 feet tonight, then dropping to
around 6500 to 7000 feet Friday night into Saturday. Higher snow
levels Thursday night through Sunday brings the risk of flooding
in lower elevations. See the Flood Advisory for more details.
In addition, there is the potential for damaging winds along the
Highway 395 corridor late Thursday into Friday evening.</description>
<instruction>Avoid travel if possible, you could be stuck in your vehicle for
many hours. If you must travel, prepare for long delays and carry
an emergency kit with extra food, water and clothing. If you stay
home, have a backup plan in case of power outages.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.
Follow guidance from local officials and building inspectors for
ways to monitor and mitigate the risk of increased snow loads on
roofs.</instruction>
