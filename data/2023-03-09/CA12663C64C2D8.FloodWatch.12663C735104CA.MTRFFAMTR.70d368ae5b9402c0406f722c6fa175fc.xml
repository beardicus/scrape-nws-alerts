<headline>Flood Watch issued March 09 at 12:06PM PST until March 10 at 7:45AM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Entire San Francisco Bay Area and Central Coast including
Monterey and San Benito Counties.
* WHEN...Through Sunday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams will see rapid rises.  Flooding may occur in
poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water crossings may be flooded.
Storm drains and ditches may become clogged with debris.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rainfall totals will range from 1.5 to 3 inches for most
urban areas with 3 to 6 inches in the coastal ranges and
inland hills. Up to 6 to 8 inches over the Santa Cruz
Mountains and locally up to 10-12 inches over favored peaks
and higher terrain of the Santa Lucia Mountains where
prolonged moderate to heavy precipitation and higher rain
rates are currently forecast. Pre-existing saturated soils
will not be able to absorb must of this rainfall and
therefore will quickly turn into runoff. Urban and small
stream flooding is expected along with a 25% exceedance
probability that some main stem rivers may rise above flood
stage.
