<headline>Rip Current Statement issued November 16 at 4:52PM AST until November 20 at 6:00AM AST by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY EVENING
THROUGH LATE SUNDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Life-threatening rip currents due to a long period
northerly swell. Breaking waves up to 7 feet are likely tonight,
increasing to 6-10 feet from tomorrow night into Sunday.
* WHERE...Beaches of western Puerto Rico north of Rincon and of
St.Thomas, St. John, and Adjacent Islands.
* WHEN...From this evening through late Sunday night.
* IMPACTS...Rip currents that can sweep even the best swimmers
away from shore into deeper water where it becomes difficult
to return to safety.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.</instruction>
