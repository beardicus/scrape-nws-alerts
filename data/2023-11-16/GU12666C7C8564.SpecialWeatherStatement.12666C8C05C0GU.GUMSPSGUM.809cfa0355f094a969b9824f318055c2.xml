<description>...TROPICAL DISTURBANCE TO PASS NEAR GUAM THIS WEEKEND...
A tropical disturbance, Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) Invest
98W, is centered near 6.8N 154.8E. Latest model guidance shows this
circulation developing slowly over the next few days as it approaches
the Marianas. Models are in fairly good agreement that the system
will move through to the south of Guam, though this is subject to
change as the circulation develops. There is a possibility this
disturbance could become a tropical depression by the time it passes
near Guam late Saturday. This system is expected to bring increased
showers and thunderstorms to the Marianas, especially Guam and Rota,
over the weekend, with wet conditions likely Saturday into Sunday
morning.
As Invest 98W strengthens and approaches the Marianas, increasing
winds, hazardous seas, numerous showers and isolated thunderstorms
are expected. Locally heavy showers leading to urban/small stream
flooding and possible flash flooding are possible Saturday into
Sunday. Marine conditions are also expected to become hazardous, with
wind gusts as high as 35 knots and seas of 9 to 11 feet possible.
Although it is possible that Invest 98W will pass through as a
tropical depression, residents of the Marianas, especially Guam,
should prepare for the possibility of tropical storm conditions.
Residents of the Marianas should monitor these changing conditions
over the next few days and watch for any updates to the forecast.
