<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON EDT TODAY THROUGH LATE
TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...All of northern New York and Vermont.
* WHEN...From Noon EDT today through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. Storm drains and ditches may
become clogged with debris. Area creeks and streams are running
high and could flood with more heavy rain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Following morning showers and thunderstorms, additional
scattered and strong thunderstorms will be capable of
producing heavy rainfall in excess of 1.5 inches in an hour.
Saturated soil conditions will cause rainfall to runoff into
creeks and streams, which remain high.
