<description>...FLOOD WATCH NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Oregon and southeast Washington, including the
following areas, in Oregon, Foothills of the Northern Blue
Mountains of Oregon, Foothills of the Southern Blue Mountains of
Oregon, Grande Ronde Valley, John Day Basin, Northern Blue
Mountains of Oregon and Southern Blue Mountains of Oregon. In
southeast Washington, Foothills of the Blue Mountains of
Washington and Northwest Blue Mountains.
* WHEN...Through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Area creeks and
streams are running high and could flood with more heavy rain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Based on expected precipitation overnight and into Saturday
morning, the flood watch is now extended into Saturday
morning. Storms have produced areas of heavy precipitation
with some sub-severe storms putting down in excess of 0.5
inch of rain in less than half an hour. More general shower
activity is expected overnight with less significant
downpours, but already inundated areas may see further
continued precipitation, causing more flooding concerns.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
