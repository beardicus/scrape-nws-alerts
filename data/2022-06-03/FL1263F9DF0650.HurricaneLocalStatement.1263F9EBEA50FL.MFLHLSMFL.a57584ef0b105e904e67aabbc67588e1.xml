SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Potential Tropical Cyclone One across the southern Gulf of
Mexico this afternoon continues to move northeast towards the
Florida peninsula tonight.
* Regardless of formation, main impacts and hazards will remain the
same. Flooding rain, tornadoes, and squally weather will be the
main impacts across South Florida with the worst conditions
expected tonight and at least the first half of Saturday.
* The main threat to the local area will be the potential for flash
flooding from excessive rainfall. A Flood Watch is in effect for
South Florida through Sunday morning.
* Isolated to several tornadoes will be possible as the system
approaches the region tonight and moves across on Saturday.
* Minor coastal flooding from surge is also possible along the
Biscayne Bay shoreline, as well as coastal flood prone areas of
the Southwest Florida coast particularly around the times of high
tide tonight and Saturday
* Poor marine and beach conditions are also expected with a high
risk for rip currents across all South Florida beaches and
elevated surf along the Atlantic coast through the weekend.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across South Florida. Potential impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.
- Ditches and canals may rapidly overflow their banks in multiple
places. Flood control systems and barriers may become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.
Streets, parking lots and underpasses become submerged. Driving
conditions become dangerous. Many road and bridge closures with
some weakened or washed out.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a dangerous tornado event having possible significant
impacts across southern and east coast of South Florida. Potential
impacts include:
- The occurrence of scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- Several places may experience tornado damage with a few spots
of considerable damage, power loss, and communications failures.
- Locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses, mobile
homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees snapped or
uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed about.
Dangerous projectiles can add to the toll.
Protect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts
across the remainder of South Florida.
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
South Florida. Potential impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* SURGE:
Protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across coastal areas of southwest Florida and the Biscayne
Bay side of Miami-Dade County. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread
with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where
surge water covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
Elsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
