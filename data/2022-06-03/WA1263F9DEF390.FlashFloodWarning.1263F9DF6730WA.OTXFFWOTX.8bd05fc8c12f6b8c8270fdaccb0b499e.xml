* At 104 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing

Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through the Chuweah Creek. The debris flow can consist of
rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms in and around
the burn scar.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flooding of areas in and around the burn scar.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Nespelem Community and Nespelem. Cache Creek Road, Joe Moses Road,
Chuweah Road.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED</description>
<instruction>This is a life threatening situation. Heavy rainfall will cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks...streams...and
ditches in the Chuweah Creek Burn Scar. Severe debris flows can also
be anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may be washed away
in places. If you encounter flood waters...climb to safety.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.</instruction>
