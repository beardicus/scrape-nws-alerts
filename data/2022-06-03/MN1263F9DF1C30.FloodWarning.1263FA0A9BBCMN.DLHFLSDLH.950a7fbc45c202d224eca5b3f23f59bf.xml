inches below the 1916 peak. The level of Namakan Lake is
expected to fall by 2 to 3 inches between June 3 and June 10.

above the 2014 flooding peak and matches the record peak of

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Once levels have peaked, it will take a matter of weeks to a month
for levels to decline to near normal summer levels. Additional
rainfall will prolong the time it takes for levels to recede.</instruction>
