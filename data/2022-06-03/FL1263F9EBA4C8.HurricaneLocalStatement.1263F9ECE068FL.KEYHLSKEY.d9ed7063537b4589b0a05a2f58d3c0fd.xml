SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
A Tropical Storm Warning remains in effect for all Florida Keys and
surrounding waters.
At 1100 PM EDT, the center of the very disorganized potential tropical
cyclone was centered about 120 nm west of Key West. Virtually all of
the wind and weather is located well east of the center. The system
is expected to move through our deep Gulf waters tonight, then out
across southern and central Florida on Saturday. An inhospitable
environment suggests this system will struggle to organize before
making land fall on the Florida mainland gulf coast. Regardless of
further development, rain and squalls will continue to affect a large
swath of the Florida Keys tonight.
There is a potential risk for multiple hazards for the Florida Keys,
including flooding rainfall, tropical storm force winds, particularly
in squalls, isolated tornadoes, and treacherous marine conditions.
Small craft should remain in port.
Additional heavy rainfall of 4 to 8 inches, with isolated maximum
totals of 12 inches, may cause significant rainwater flooding. A Flood
Watch remains in effect through Saturday evening.
A few tornadoes will be possible this evening through Saturday.
There is potential for minor coastal flooding of 1 to 2 feet above
mean sea level along the Gulfside/Bayside Saturday, especially over the
bayside communities in the Upper Keys. Significant oceanside wave
overwash is expected this evening through Saturday, most evident around
the times of higher high tide.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across the Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities. Driving conditions become dangerous. Road closures
may be possible.
* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across the
Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many tree limbs broken off. A few small trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages possible.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
the Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
* COASTAL FLOODING:
Sustained strong to tropical storm force southerly to southwesterly
winds will result in minor coastal flooding of 1 to 2 feet along the
Bayside and Gulfside this evening through Saturday afternoon.
Significant oceanside wave overwash is expected this evening through
Saturday, most evident around the times of higher high tide.
- Localized flooding mainly along immediate shorelines and in low-
lying spots.
- Driving conditions dangerous over flooded roads.
- Moderate beach erosion.
- Minor damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. A few
small craft broken away from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
No mandatory evacuations are in effect expected for this storm.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Ensure you are in a safe location from strong winds or possible
flooding.
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
in a low-lying or poor drainage area, plan to move to safe shelter on
higher ground.
If a Tornado Warning is issued for your area, be ready to shelter
quickly, preferably away from windows and in an interior room not
prone to flooding. If driving, scan the roadside for quick shelter
options.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
