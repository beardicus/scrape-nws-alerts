SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Potential Tropical Cyclone One remains very disorganized as it
continues to move northeast toward the Florida Keys and South
Florida tonight. The system is forecast to move across the southern
Florida peninsula on Saturday.
Regardless of additional development, Potential Tropical Cyclone One
is expected to bring heavy rainfall and the potential for flooding
across parts of east-central Florida. Rainfall totals of 4 to 8
inches are forecast across Okeechobee, Martin, Saint Lucie, and
Indian River Counties, with locally higher amounts up to 10 inches
possible. There will be a sharp rainfall gradient across Osceola and
Brevard Counties. The southern portions of these counties, from
approximately Kenansville to Melbourne south, are forecast to
receive up to 3 inches of rain with locally higher amounts possible.
The northern portions of Osceola and Brevard Counties are forecast
to receive up to 2 inches of rain, with locally higher amounts up to
3 inches possible.
The frequency of showers and squalls will increase tonight from
south to north as the system approaches the area. Sustained winds
may approach tropical storm force, and will gust above tropical
storm force in squalls. Based on the latest forecast track,
the strongest winds and gusts are expected from early Saturday
morning through around sunset.
A few tornadoes cannot be ruled out, mainly from Cape Canaveral to
Okeechobee County southward, including the Treasure Coast. The tornado
threat will be greatest late tonight through Saturday afternoon. Storm
surge is not expected along the east central Florida coast.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across the Treasure Coast and Okeechobee County.
Potential impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may
become dangerous rivers. In mountain areas, destructive runoff
may run quickly down valleys while increasing susceptibility to
rockslides and mudslides. Flood control systems and barriers
may become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.
Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with
underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.
Many road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible limited
to significant impacts across part of Brevard and Osceola Counties.
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts from
Cape Canaveral to Kenansville southward, including the Treasure Coast.
Potential impacts in this area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across East Central Florida, little to no impact is
anticipated.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts from
Melbourne to Okeechobee County southward, including the Treasure
Coast. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
Elsewhere across East Central Florida, little to no impact is
anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
It is important to remain calm, informed and focused. Be patient and
helpful with those you encounter.
If you are a visitor, be sure to know the name of the city or town in
which you are staying and the name of the county or parish in which
it resides. Listen for these locations in local news updates. Pay
attention for instructions from local authorities.
If a Tornado Warning is issued for your area, be ready to shelter
quickly, preferably away from windows and in an interior room not
prone to flooding. If driving, scan the roadside for quick shelter
options.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
