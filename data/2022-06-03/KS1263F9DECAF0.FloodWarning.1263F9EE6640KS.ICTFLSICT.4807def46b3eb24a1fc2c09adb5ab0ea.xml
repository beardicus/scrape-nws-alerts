<instruction>Do not drive into flooded areas or go around barricades. Nearly two
feet of water will carry most vehicles away. Turn around, don`t
drown.
Caution is urged when walking near riverbanks.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. Most flood related deaths
occur in automobiles. Do not attempt to cross water covered bridges,
dips, or low water crossings. Never try to cross a flowing stream,
even a small one, on foot. To escape rising water find another route
over higher ground.
