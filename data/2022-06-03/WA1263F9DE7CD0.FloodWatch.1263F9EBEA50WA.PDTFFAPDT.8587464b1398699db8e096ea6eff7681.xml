<headline>Flood Watch issued June 03 at 10:00AM PDT  by NWS Pendleton</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Oregon and southeast Washington, including the
following areas, in Oregon, Foothills of the Northern Blue
Mountains of Oregon, Foothills of the Southern Blue Mountains of
Oregon, Grande Ronde Valley, John Day Basin, Northern Blue
Mountains of Oregon and Southern Blue Mountains of Oregon. In
southeast Washington, Foothills of the Blue Mountains of
Washington and Northwest Blue Mountains.
* WHEN...Through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Area creeks and
streams are running high and could flood with more heavy rain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Scattered showers and thunderstorms this morning and
afternoon will continue to move over areas with nearly
saturated soils. Localized heavier rainfall outputs from
stronger storms may also increase flood risk. In addition,
burn scars such as the Green Ridge fire burn scar may result
in an increased risk of flooding and debris flow if they are
affected by heavy downpours.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
