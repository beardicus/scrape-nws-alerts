nearly stationary thunderstorms over Rayado and the far
northeast portion of the Cook`s Peak burn scar. This will
cause arroyo and small stream flooding. Between 0.25 and 1
inch of rain has fallen.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 0.25 to 0.5 inches are
expected over the area. This additional rain will result in
minor flooding.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Rayado.

area near Rayado.</instruction>
