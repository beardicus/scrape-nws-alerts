Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Thunderstorms with high rainfall rates are expected this

rates over saturated soils will lead to localized street
flooding, runoff into already elevated streams, creeks and
rivers, and renewed inundation of low-lying areas.
