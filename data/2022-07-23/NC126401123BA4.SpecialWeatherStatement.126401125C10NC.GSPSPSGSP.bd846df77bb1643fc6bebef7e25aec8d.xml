<description>...A THUNDERSTORM WITH TORRENTIAL RAINFALL WILL IMPACT SOUTHWESTERN
MADISON...NORTHEASTERN HAYWOOD AND WEST CENTRAL BUNCOMBE COUNTIES
UNTIL 900 PM EDT...
At 816 PM EDT, Doppler radar was tracking a thunderstorm with
torrential rainfall 13 miles north of Waynesville, or 8 miles east
of Smoky Mountains-Cataloochee. This storm was nearly stationary.
Locations to be impacted include...
Smoky Mountains-Cataloochee, Lake Junaluska, Cove Creek, Luck and
Fines Creek.
Very heavy rainfall rates up to 2 inches per hour will be possible
in these areas and isolated flooding could result in low-lying and
poor drainage areas.</description>
<instruction>Torrential rainfall may flood areas with poor drainage, such as
ditches and underpasses. Avoid these areas and do not cross flooded
roads. Water levels of small streams may also rise rapidly. Seek
higher ground if threatened by flood waters.
Frequent lightning is occurring with this storm. If outdoors, try to
get indoors or into a hard topped vehicle. Otherwise, stay away from
open areas and isolated high objects such as trees. When indoors,
stay away from windows and doors and avoid using wired electronic
devices. Do not take a shower or bath. Try to unplug unnecessary
appliances before the storm approaches.</instruction>
