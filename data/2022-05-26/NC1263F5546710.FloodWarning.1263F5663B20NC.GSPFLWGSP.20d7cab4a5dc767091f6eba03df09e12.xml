<description>...The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg SC has
issued a Flood Warning for the following rivers in North Carolina...

.Significant flows are being released from the reservoirs in the
east and west forks of the Tuckasegee River in southern Jackson

at Lake Glenville and further rises along the Tuckasegee River are
expected over the next several hours.  Additional heavy rainfall is
possible overnight tonight and may exacerbate ongoing rises.
Therefore, the Tuckasegee River at Bryson City is expected to
continue rising over the next several hours, and will at least
exceed the Minor Flood Stage of 10 feet.  However, more significant
rises, possibly reaching 12-13 feet, are possible into the early
overnight hours.  Residents and campers along the Tuckasegee River
from Whittier to Bryson City are urged to find higher ground before

levels and forecast for the latest information.  Please heed all
guidance from Swain County Emergency Management.
