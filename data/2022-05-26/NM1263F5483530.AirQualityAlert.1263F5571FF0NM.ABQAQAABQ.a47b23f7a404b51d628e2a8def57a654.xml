<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT...
The following message is transmitted at the request of the New Mexico
Departments of Health and Environment, United States Forest Service
and the Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality Response Program.
* WHAT...Smoke from the Black and Bear Trap fires will not be
transported as far south or southeast this afternoon; however
significant impacts to include UNHEALTHY air quality at times are
expected in close proximity to the fires as well as along portions
of the neighboring Mimbres and Rio Grande Valleys, especially
during the evening. Elsewhere, air quality may, at times, become
UNHEALTHY for SENSITIVE GROUPS (USG) in the vicinity of Pecos, San
Jose, and Ribera to the south of the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon fire
tonight. Drainage winds may carry locally dense smoke into upper
portions of the Galisteo Basin southeast of Santa Fe with MODERATE
impacts for Eldorado and Lamy. Going into Friday and Saturday, haze
will likely be more noticeable and persistent away from the larger
fires to include the Middle Rio Grande Valley.
* WHERE...The most significant impacts from smoke are expected to
persist across much of Catron, western Socorro, northern Grant,
northern Luna and western Sierra counties. More details on impacted
locations and latest air quality information can be found at
https://fire.airnow.gov..
* WHEN...Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1 pm MDT Friday,
May 27.
* IMPACTS...Those with conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and heart
disease will be especially vulnerable to impacts from poor air
quality, as will adults over age 65, young children, and pregnant
women if smoke concentrations become unhealthy.
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method available
at https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/IndoorQuality.html and
https://cv.nmhealth.org
New Mexicans will also need to take steps to keep their homes cool to
avoid heat-related illnesses. NMDOH offers tips here:
