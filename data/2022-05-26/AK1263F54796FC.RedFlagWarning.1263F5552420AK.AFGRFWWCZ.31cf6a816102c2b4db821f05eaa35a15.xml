<headline>Red Flag Warning issued May 26 at 9:19AM AKDT until May 26 at 10:00PM AKDT by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>......RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONE 216 FROM NOON
TO 10 PM TODAY...
.DISCUSSION...High pressure aloft building over the West Coast
and Interior of Alaska will cause a warming trend through the
weekend over Interior Alaska, with highs in the 60s and lower 70s
rising into the 70s over the weekend.  The current dry conditions
will remain through Fri, with a slight increase in moisture over
the weekend as evaporating moisture builds up under the high aloft.
A thermal low pressure trough stretching from Northway to
Ft Yukon to Ambler will intensify today, then weaken in place
Fri and Sat. This will cause west winds of 15 mph with gusts to
25 mph in the afternoon and evening today over zone 216,
with winds decreasing Fri. Given the dry fuels and warm,
dry conditions, these winds will cause Red Flag Conditions today.
