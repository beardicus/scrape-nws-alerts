<headline>Flood Advisory issued May 26 at 9:56PM EDT until May 27 at 3:45AM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 345 AM EDT FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of western North Carolina, including the
following county, Haywood.
* WHEN...Until 345 AM EDT Friday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
Dangerous flows over low-water crossings.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 943 PM EDT, Earlier heavy rainfall has temporarily ended
across southern Haywood County and the original flash flood
threat has ended.  However, the east and west forks of the
Pigeon River remain elevated and after the initial crest
earlier, have receded only to began to rise again due to
additional runoff.  The tributaries are not expected to reach
critical levels during this current rise and will crest lower
than they did earlier.  Therefore, the Flash Flood Warning is
being cancelled and replaced with a Flood Advisory in order
to maintain awareness of high flows and continued potential
for nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to the East
Fork and West Fork Pigeon River.
- Be aware that additional heavy rainfall is expected overnight
tonight.  This rainfall may be significant and produce new
rounds of flash flooding.  Due to elevated stream flows,
there is the potential for more significant flash flooding
tonight.  Therefore, residents and campers in the area from
Canton to Cruso, Sunburst, Retreat, and Lake Logan may need
to consider staying on higher ground away from streams
overnight tonight until the threat has passed later Friday
morning.  Flash flooding may develop quickly and give you
little time to evacuate.  If you are at a campground adjacent
to a stream and heavy rain begins tonight, seek higher ground
immediately and do not wait for a Flash Flood Warning to be
issued.
- Some locations that may continue to experience flooding
include...
Graveyard Fields, Sunburst, and Cruso.

<instruction>Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
