<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued May 26 at 3:41PM CDT until May 28 at 9:00PM CDT by NWS El Paso</headline>
<description>...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED ON SATURDAY...
.An approaching upper level system will create stronger west to
southwest winds Saturday afternoon. Winds look to become gusty in
the higher terrain locations as stronger winds aloft move over the
area, especially over the Gila Region and Sacramento Mountains.
Afternoon humidity values will remain in the single digits through
the weekend as well, with overnight humidity recoveries
struggling to make it over 30%. A very dry spring has led to
extremely dry fuels over much of southern New Mexico and far west
Texas. These critical fire weather conditions are expected to
persist through the holiday weekend; with winds strengthening in
the afternoon hours, afternoon humidity values remaining extremely
dry, and overnight humidity recoveries hardly reaching 30%.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY MORNING
THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING FOR LOW HUMIDITIES AND STRONG WINDS FOR
FIRE WEATHER ZONES 055, 056, 110, 111, 112, AND 113...
* AFFECTED AREA...Southwest and south central New Mexico, and far
west Texas.
* WIND...Southwest winds of 15 to 25 mph with gusts up to 35 mph.
Potentially stronger gusts in higher terrain areas.
* HUMIDITY...5 to 10%.
* IMPACTS...Any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly.
Outdoor burning is not recommended. Please check with the local
agencies for updated burn ban information.</description>
