<headline>Flood Warning issued May 26 at 10:19PM EDT until May 28 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM EDT FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of western North Carolina, including the
following counties, Jackson and Transylvania.
* WHEN...Until 400 AM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Streams continue to rise due to excess runoff from
earlier rainfall. Low-water crossings are inundated with water and
may not be passable. Minor flooding along the French Broad River
from Rosman to Brevard to Etowah to Blantyre will continue for at
least the next several hours, impacting common, flood-prone
roadways, boat access areas, farmland, and other areas adjacent to
streams.  Additional, nuisance flooding will continue to develop
along the Davidson River and the Little River as well through the
overnight hours.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1004 PM EDT, Earlier heavy rainfall has temporarily ended
across Transylvania and extreme southeastern Jackson counties
and the original flash flood threat has ended.  However,
streams across the area remain high and several remain out of
their banks, continuing to flood low-lying areas.  Area
streams that originally crested and fell below bankfull are
rising again on additional runoff.  The French Broad River at
Rosman has returned to Minor Flood Stage, and may rise higher
than earlier crests if additional rainfall develops.  The
Davidson River and Little River continue to rise between
Action Stage and Minor Flood Stage.  The Little River will
likely exceed Minor Flood Stage later tonight.  Therefore,
the Flash Flood Warning was cancelled and replaced with a
Flood Warning.
Be aware that additional heavy rainfall is expected overnight
tonight.  This rainfall may be significant and produce new
rounds of flash flooding.  Due to elevated stream flows,
there is the potential for more significant flash flooding
tonight.  New Flash Flood Warnings may be issued.  Therefore,
residents and campers in the area from Lake Toxaway to Balsam
Grove to Rosman, Pisgah Forest, Brevard, and Etowah need to
be prepared to seek higher ground immediately.  Flash
flooding may develop quickly and give you little time to
evacuate.  Do not wait for a Flash Flood Warning to take
action once heavy rain begins.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches are possible in
the warned area overnight tonight.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Brevard, Rosman, Gorges State Park, Dupont State Forest,
Balsam Grove, Connestee, Wolf Mountain, Sapphire, Penrose,
Cedar Mountain, Little River In Transylvania County and North
Transylvania.</description>
<instruction>In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
