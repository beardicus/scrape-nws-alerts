<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 AM EDT FRIDAY FOR
JACKSON COUNTY...
At 1140 PM EDT, Heavy rainfall had ended earlier across Jackson
County, but a new round of moderate rain is entering the county and
may persist for the next 1-2 hours before another lull occurs.
Storm-total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches was observed across the
county, with the heaviest rain across the southern third of the
county over the headwaters of the Tuckasegee River.
Unusually high flows continue to impact the reservoirs of the east
and west forks of the Tuckasegee River and these high flows are
continuing to cause significant rises along the Tuckasegee River.
This is resulting in widespread Minor to isolated Moderate flooding
within the valley and this flooding is expected to continue for
several more hours before the floodwave moves downstream into Swain
County and conditions gradually improve by Friday morning.
Several vulnerable mobile homes along Fred Smith Road near the
community of Tuckasegee reported floodwaters 3-4 feet deep earlier
and evacuations have been needed this evening.  Additional impacts
are likely to develop downstream including additional significant
flooding.  Residents and other persons near the Tuckasegee River
need to be prepared to heed any evacuation orders or other guidance
from Jackson County Emergency Management and seek higher ground if
the river continues to rise.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms producing
flash flooding.
SOURCE...Emergency management reported.
IMPACT...Life threatening flash flooding of creeks and streams,
urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses continues
tonight.  Areas along the east and west forks of the
Tuckasegee River and areas of the Tuckasegee River
downstream from the confluence near NC 107 and NC 281 to
Cullowhee to Webster to Dillsboro to Whittier will
continue to see rises and Minor to Moderate flooding.
Moderate flooding is defined as significant flooding of
flood-prone, low-lying areas adjacent to streams
including farmland, campgrounds, greenways, parks, and
boat-access areas.  Additionally, some structural
flooding is expected, including homes that are
immediately adjacent to streams.
Some locations that will continue to experience flash flooding
include...
Sylva, Cherokee, Cullowhee, Webster, Dillsboro, Cashiers, Lake
Glenville, Tuckasegee, Savannah, and Whittier.
Additional rainfall of 1-2 inches is possible tonight before the
heavy rain threat finally ends later tonight.  This will prolong
ongoing flooding and may cause new areas of flooding to develop.
Locally heavier rainfall is possible.  It will be critically
important to stay weather aware and be prepared to seek higher
ground if new flash flooding develops.
FLASH FLOOD...OBSERVED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>Please heed all messages and evacuation orders from Jackson County
Emergency Management officials.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles. Obey all barricades and find alternative
routes to stay alive.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.</instruction>
