basement or small central room in a sturdy structure.
If on or near W Kerr Scott Reservoir, get away from the water and
move indoors or inside a vehicle. Remember, lightning can strike out
to 15 miles from the parent thunderstorm. If you can hear thunder,
you are close enough to be struck by lightning. Move to safe shelter
now! Do not be caught on the water in a thunderstorm.
When it is safe to do so, please send your reports of hail of any
size, as well as reports of any wind damage, including downed trees
