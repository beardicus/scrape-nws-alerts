<description>......RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONE 216 FROM
NOON TO 10 PM TODAY...
.DISCUSSION...
High pressure aloft building over the West Coast and Interior of
Alaska through Sat will persist into next week. This will cause
a warming trend through the weekend over Interior Alaska, with
warm conditions continuing next week. Highs in the 60s and lower
70s will continue over the Interior today and Fri, rising into
the 70s over the weekend and remaining warm into next week. The
current dry conditions with Min RH of 15-30% will remain through
Fri, with a slight increase in moisture over the weekend as
evaporating moisture builds up under the subsidence inversion
associated with the high aloft.
A thermal low pressure trough stretching from Glennallen to
Northway to Ft Yukon to Buckland will intensify today, then weaken
in place tonight and remain weak through Sat. This is causing
west winds 15 mph gusting to 30 mph along the Yukon River this
afternoon and evening, with winds decreasing late tonight as the
trough weakens. Given the dry fuels and warm, dry conditions,
these winds will cause Red Flag conditions in zone 216 through
10 PM today. The winds will decrease late tonight as the temps cool
and the thermal trough weakens, and remain less than 15 mph
through the weekend.
