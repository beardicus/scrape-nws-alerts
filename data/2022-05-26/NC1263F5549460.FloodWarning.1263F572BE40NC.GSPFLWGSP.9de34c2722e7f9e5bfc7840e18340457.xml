following county, Henderson.
* WHEN...Until 430 AM EDT Friday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1024 PM EDT, Earlier heavy rainfall of 1-3 inches has
ended across Henderson County.  Most small streams have
receded below critical levels.  However, Mud Creek near
Hendersonville remains above Minor Flood Stage, impacting
farmland, nurseries, greenways, and other low-lying areas
adjacent to Mud Creek near Kanuga Rd and Erkwood Dr to
southern Hendersonville and the Oklawaha Greenway.  Mud Creek
has crested and will slowly recede over the next several
hours if no additional rainfall occurs.  High flows are also
occurring along the Green River and flooding within the Green
River Gorge is likely as well over the next several hours.
Be aware that additional heavy rainfall is expected overnight
tonight.  This rainfall may be significant and produce new
rounds of flash flooding.  Due to elevated stream flows,
there is the potential for more significant flash flooding
tonight.  New Flash Flood Warnings may be issued.  Therefore,
be prepared to seek higher ground immediately.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are possible in
the warned area.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Hendersonville, Flat Rock, Mountain Home, Laurel Park,
Saluda, Dupont State Forest, Jones Gap State Park, Valley
Hill, East Flat Rock, Crab Creek, Tuxedo and Dana.</description>
