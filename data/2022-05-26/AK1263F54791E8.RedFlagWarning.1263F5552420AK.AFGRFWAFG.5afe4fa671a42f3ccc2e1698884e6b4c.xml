<description>......RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONES 220, 221,
222 AND 223 FROM DELTA JUNCTION AND FT YUKON WEST FROM NOON
TO 10 PM TODAY...
.DISCUSSION...High pressure aloft building over the West Coast
and Interior of Alaska will cause a warming trend through the
weekend over Interior Alaska, with highs in the 60s and lower 70s
rising into the 70s over the weekend.  The current dry conditions
will remain through Fri, with a slight increase in moisture over
the weekend as evaporating moisture builds up under the high aloft.
A thermal low pressure trough stretching from Northway to
Ft Yukon to Ambler will intensify today, then weaken in place
Fri and Sat. This will cause west winds of 15 mph with gusts to
25 mph in the afternoon and evening today, with winds decreasing Fri.
Given the dry fuels and warm, dry conditions, these winds will
cause Red Flag Conditions from Delta Junction west today.
