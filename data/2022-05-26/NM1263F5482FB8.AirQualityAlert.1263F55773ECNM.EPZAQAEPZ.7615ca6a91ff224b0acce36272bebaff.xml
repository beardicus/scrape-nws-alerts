<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 PM MDT FRIDAY...
The New Mexico Departments of Health and Environment has issued an
Air Quality Alert, until 2 PM MDT Friday.
An Air Quality Alert for Smoke has been issued.
* WHAT... Smoke from the Black and Bear Trap fires will not be transported
as far south or southeast this afternoon; however significant
impacts to include UNHEALTHY air quality at times are expected in
close proximity to the fires as well as along portions of the
neighboring Mimbres and Rio Grande Valleys especially during the
evening. Elsewhere, air quality may, at times, become UNHEALTHY for
SENSITIVE GROUPS (USG) in the vicinity of Pecos, San Jose and
Ribera to the south of the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon fire tonight.
Drainage winds may carry locally dense smoke into upper portions of
the Galisteo Basin southeast of Santa Fe with MODERATE impacts for
Eldorado and Lamy. Going into Friday and Saturday, haze will
likely be more noticeable and persistent away from the larger fires
to include the Middle Rio Grande Valley.
* WHERE... The most significant impacts from smoke are expected to
persist across much of Catron, western Socorro County, northern
Grant, northern Luna and western Sierra counties. More details on
impacted locations and latest air quality information can be found
at https://fire.airnow.gov
* WHEN...  Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1pm MDT Friday, May 27
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method available
at https://nmtracking.doh.nm.gov/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
