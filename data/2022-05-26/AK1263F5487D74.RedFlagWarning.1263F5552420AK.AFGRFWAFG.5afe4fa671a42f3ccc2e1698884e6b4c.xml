<description>......RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONES 220, 221,
222 AND 223 FROM DELTA JUNCTION AND FT YUKON WEST FROM NOON TO
10 PM TODAY...
.DISCUSSION...
High pressure aloft building over the West Coast
and Interior of Alaska will cause a warming trend through the
weekend over Interior Alaska, with highs in the 60s and lower 70s
rising into the 70s over the weekend.  The current dry conditions
will remain through Fri, with a slight increase in moisture over
the weekend as evaporating moisture builds up under the high
aloft.
A thermal low pressure trough stretching from Glennallen to
Northway to Ft Yukon to Buckland will intensify today, then weaken
in place tonight and remain weak through Sat. This is causing
west winds of 15 mph with gusts to 30 mph this afternoon and
evening over the Interior south of the Yukon River, with winds
decreasing late tonight as the trough weakens. Given the dry fuels
and warm, dry conditions, these winds will cause Red Flag
conditions from Ft Yukon and Delta Junction west through 10 PM
today. The winds will decrease late tonight as the temps cool and
the thermal trough weakens, and remain less than 15 mph through
the weekend.
