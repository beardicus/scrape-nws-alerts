<headline>Lake Wind Advisory issued November 01 at 7:59PM EDT until November 02 at 8:00AM EDT by NWS Charleston</headline>
<description>...LAKE WIND ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM EDT THURSDAY FOR
LAKE MOULTRIE...
...FREEZE WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 2 AM TO 10 AM EDT
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...For the Lake Wind Advisory, northeast winds 15 to 20
knots and gusts up to 25 knots. For the Freeze Warning, sub-
freezing temperatures as low as 29 to 32 expected.
* WHERE...Inland Berkeley County.
* WHEN...For the Lake Wind Advisory, until 8 AM EDT Thursday.
For the Freeze Warning, from 2 AM to 10 AM EDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Strong winds and rough waves on Lake Moultrie will
create hazardous conditions for small craft. Frost and freeze
conditions will kill crops, other sensitive vegetation and
possibly damage unprotected outdoor plumbing.</description>
<instruction>Boaters on Lake Moultrie should use extra caution since strong
winds and rough waves can overturn small craft.
Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.</instruction>
