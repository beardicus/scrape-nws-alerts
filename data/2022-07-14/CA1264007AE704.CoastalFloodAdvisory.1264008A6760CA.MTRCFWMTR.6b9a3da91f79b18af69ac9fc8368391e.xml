<description>...KING TIDES WILL CAUSE MINOR COASTAL FLOODING AT LOW LYING
SPOTS DURING HIGH TIDE LATE EACH NIGHT THIS WEEK...
.The highest astronomical tides of the year, commonly referred to
as the King Tides, will again impact the coast and bayshore each
night this week through late Thursday night and have historically
resulted in the localized flooding of specific low lying areas
each year. In addition, the lowest low tides of the event will be
observed during the early morning hours which may lead to trouble
for mariners navigating shallow waterways.
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 11 PM THIS
EVENING TO 3 AM PDT FRIDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY WILL EXPIRE AT 2 AM PDT EARLY THIS
MORNING...
* WHAT...Minor coastal flooding expected.
* WHERE...North Bay Interior Valleys, San Francisco Bay
Shoreline and San Francisco.
* WHEN...From 11 PM this evening to 3 AM PDT Friday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Tidal levels will also rise along the
Pacific coast but impacts will be more localized to areas
along the SF Bay shoreline. Tide poolers and beachgoers should
be familiar with the times and heights of local tidal levels
to avoid hazards that may arise from rapidly shifting water
levels..</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
