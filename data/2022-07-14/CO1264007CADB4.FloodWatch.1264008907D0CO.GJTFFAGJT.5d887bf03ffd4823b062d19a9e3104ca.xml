<headline>Flood Watch issued July 14 at 2:05PM MDT  by NWS GrandJunction</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY MORNING THROUGH FRIDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible,
especially across the Grizzly Creek, Lake Christine and Pine Gulch
Fire burn areas. Smaller burn scars within the watch area are also
at risk.
* WHERE...Portions of northwest Colorado and west central Colorado,
including the following areas. In northwest Colorado, the Elkhead
and Park Mountains, Flat Tops and Roan and Tavaputs Plateaus. In
west central Colorado, the Central Colorado River Basin and the
Gore and Elk Mountains/Central Mountain Valleys.
* WHEN...From Friday morning through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations. In
addition, heavy rainfall over the Grizzly Creek, Lake Christine
and Pine Gulch Fire burn areas, amongst others, is possible during
the period of the watch. Residents and travellers near any of
these burn areas should prepare for potential flooding impacts. Be
sure to stay up to date with information from local authorities.
Heavy rainfall could trigger flash flooding of low-lying areas,
urbanized street flooding, and debris flows in and near recent
wildfire burn scars.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- An unusually potent surge of monsoon moisture is poised to
sweep over the region on Friday. This combined with an upper
level disturbance moving over northwest Colorado during the
afternoon raises the threat of excessive rainfall which may
lead to flash flooding and debris flows, particularly across
recent burn areas.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
