<description>...KENNICOTT GLACIER DAMMED HIDDEN LAKE RELEASING...
Hidden Lake, which is dammed by the Kennicott Glacier, has begun to
release and may cause a significant rise on the Kennicott River at
McCarthy. The Kennicott River water level prior to the release
was 1342.5 ft, gage datum, on the river gage.
Expect water levels on the Kennicott River to rise an additional
2 to 5 feet over the next 24 to 48 hours.
This is a yearly event that occurs in mid to late summer. Due to the
lower than historical median water levels on the Kennicott River from
cooler temperatures this past week, the glacial dammed lake
release is expected to produce a smaller hydrographic response
than in previous years.
Persons living or traveling in the vicinity of the Kennicott
River are urged to prepare for rapidly rising water and possible
minor flooding and bank erosion during the next several days.
Persons traveling for recreation should avoid parking or camping
in low lying areas near the Kennicott River.
The Chitina and Copper Rivers will experience moderate rises in water
levels as the glacier dammed outburst wave progresses downstream.
EXPECTED IMPACTS: Minor river bank erosion. Possible minor
flooding in low lying areas.</description>
