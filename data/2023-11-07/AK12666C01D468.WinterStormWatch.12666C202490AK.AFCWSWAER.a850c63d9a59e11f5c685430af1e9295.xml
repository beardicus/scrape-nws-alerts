<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued November 07 at 5:34PM AKST until November 09 at 4:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM AKST WEDNESDAY
THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Snow, blowing snow, heavy snow, and mixed precipitation
possible. Total snow accumulations of 4 to 10 inches possible.
* WHERE...Anchorage.
* WHEN...From late tonight through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be hazardous. Areas of blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A major winter storm could bring a variety
of weather to Anchorage tonight through Thursday. Light snow
will arrive overnight tonight into early Wednesday morning.
North winds gusting 15 to 25 mph will cause areas of blowing
snow and low visibilities, primarily along Knik Arm and the
Glenn Highway corridor down to north to west Anchorage.
There is then a large amount of uncertainty in the track of a
storm system across the Gulf. One potential scenario would
bring periods of light snow, possibly mixed with rain
Wednesday afternoon through Thursday afternoon. This would
produce generally light amounts of snow. A second scenario
would bring heavy snow to Anchorage beginning by midday
Wednesday and continuing through Wednesday night or Thursday.
With this solution snowfall totals would be significant, with
a foot or more of snow possible, especially along the
Anchorage and Eagle River Hillsides and the Hiland Road area.
Stay tuned as we monitor this potentially impactful winter
storm.</description>
