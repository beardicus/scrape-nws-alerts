<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM THIS

* WHAT...Snow and blowing snow expected. Total snow
accumulations of up to one inch. North winds gusting 25 to 35
mph.
* WHERE...Western Kenai Peninsula, along the Inlet from Anchor
Point north to Nikiski, including Kenai and Soldotna.
* WHEN...From 9 PM this evening to 5 AM AKST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Falling and

evening, strongest along and near Cook Inlet. Snow will
develop near Anchor Point late this evening and spread north
to Nikiski overnight. The snow and blowing snow will be fairly
short-lived in any given location, on the order of a few
hours. Temperatures will warm overnight, possibly causing a
changeover to rain before precipitation ends early Wednesday
morning.</description>
