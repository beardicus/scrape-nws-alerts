<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued November 07 at 5:35AM AKST until November 09 at 4:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH
THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Snow, blowing snow, heavy snow, and mixed precipitation
possible.
* WHERE...Matanuska Valley.
* WHEN...From late tonight through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be hazardous. Areas of blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A major winter storm could bring a variety
of weather to the Matanuska Valley tonight through Thursday.
There is a chance for a brief period of light snow late tonight
through early Tuesday morning. Northeast winds gusting 25 to 40
mph through the Palmer and Wasilla areas will result in blowing
snow and low visibilities if it does snow.
There is then a large amount of uncertainty in the track of a
storm system across the Gulf. One potential scenario will
bring periods of light snow, possibly mixed with rain
Wednesday afternoon through Thursday afternoon. This would
produce generally light amounts of snow. A second scenario
would bring heavy snow to the Valley beginning by midday
Wednesday and continuing through Wednesday night or Thursday.
With this solution snowfall totals would be significant, with a
foot or more of snow possible, especially north of Palmer on up
to Chickaloon.
Stay tuned as we monitor this potentially impactful winter
storm.</description>
