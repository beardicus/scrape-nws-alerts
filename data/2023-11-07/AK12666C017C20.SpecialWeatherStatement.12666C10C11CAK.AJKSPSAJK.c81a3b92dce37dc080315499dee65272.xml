<description>...STORM FORCE LOWS FOR WEDNESDAY AND FRIDAY...
A strong low over the Gulf of Alaska will bring a storm force
front to the panhandle tomorrow. This system will bring increased
winds along the outer coast. Wind gusts could range from 45 to 55
mph. Forecast guidance today continues to show a strong front
impacting the area Wednesday morning to Thursday morning. As
such, confidence in this system continues to increase. Most places
look to see their strongest winds during afternoon and into the
overnight hours Wednesday into Thursday. Winds behind the front
are expected to decrease after the front moves through but post
frontal winds are expected to be 20 to 30 mph before further
decreasing on Thursday.
River rises are expected with this first system moving through as
temperatures are expected to warm. Snow levels are also expected
to rise with the warming temperatures so some snow melting will be
likely during this event. River flooding is not expected at this
time as rivers are running lower due to the colder temperatures
allowing precipitation to fall as snow at elevation.
After the storm exits the area on Thursday, we will see a brief
break for Southeast Alaska before another system moves into the
during the overnight hours Thursday night into the morning on
Friday. Forecast guidance for this second system continues to show
strong winds along the front moving across the panhandle through
the day on Friday starting during the morning hours. Right now,
winds are expected to be 30 to 40 mph with gusts up to 55 mph.
This is an evolving and changing situation. Stay tuned to the
National Weather Service for updates at weather.gov/Juneau.</description>
