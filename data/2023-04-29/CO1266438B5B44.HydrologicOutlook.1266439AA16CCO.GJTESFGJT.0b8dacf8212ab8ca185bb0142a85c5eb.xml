<description>...HEAVY RUNOFF FROM SNOWMELT WILL LEAD TO HIGH FLOWS AND INCREASING
RIVER LEVELS ACROSS MANY TRIBUTARIES AND THE MAIN STEM OF THE YAMPA
RIVER BY EARLY NEXT WEEK...
Areas along tributaries of the Yampa River and on the main stem of
the Yampa River in Northwest Colorado will likely be impacted by
increasing river flows and river levels by early next week.
Melting of this year`s snowpack will accelerate as temperatures
continue to rise through the weekend and into early next week.
Runoff into many of the tributaries of the Yampa River...especially
in the upper basin...will produce rapidly increased flows by early
next week. This water will continue downstream on the main stem of
the Yampa River to the confluence with the Green River by the middle
of next week. Impacts from these increased flows on those living
adjacent to these water ways can be expected beginning with low land
flooding. Banks near these swollen rivers could become unstable and
should be avoided. Recreational interests should be prepared for the
impacts of high flows as camping areas and access to the river may
become inaccessible or inundated. Please heed local advisories and
closures.
Stay tuned for additional statements and/or Watches and Warnings as
river levels continue to rise.</description>
