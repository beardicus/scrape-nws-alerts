<description>...Warming Temperatures this Weekend Increase Snow Melt and the
Potential for Flooding...
Temperatures steadily continue to climb through Wednesday, which
will melt low elevation and foothill snow across far west Wyoming.
High temperatures in the valleys will range from 55 to 65 each
afternoon with a few readings nearing 70 by Monday and into the
middle 70s by Tuesday.
These warm temperatures could result in significant melting of low
elevation snow given the deep snowpack that still exists in the
valleys. As of Saturday, April 29, many locations still had a snow
depth of 12 to 24 inches. Bedford and Smoot reported the greatest
snow depth of 26 and 38 inches, respectively. Rapid melting of this
snowpack could quickly raise the water levels in smaller tributary
creeks and streams in the Bear, Salt, and Snake River basins of
Lincoln and Teton counties. Low-elevation snow pack in northwestern
Sublette County, such as around Daniel, could also melt
significantly with these warm temperatures, and feed local streams
and creeks in that basin as well.
Now would be the time to clear snow, ice, and debris from culverts
and other flow paths to allow runoff to flow away from buildings and
other vulnerable infrastructure. This could include moving deep snow
away from the foundations of buildings, relocating equipment to
higher ground, and moving livestock out of poorly drained or
low-lying areas.
Stay tuned for the latest river forecasts. Remember, if you
encounter a flooded roadway, turn around don`t drown. You never
know what road conditions are hidden under the water.</description>
