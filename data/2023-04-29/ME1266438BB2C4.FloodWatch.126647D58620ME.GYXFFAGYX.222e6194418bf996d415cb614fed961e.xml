EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Maine, including the following areas,
Androscoggin, Central Interior Cumberland, Coastal Cumberland,
Coastal York, Interior Cumberland Highlands, Interior York,
Kennebec, Southern Franklin, Southern Oxford and Southern

creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Current streamflows are near normal, but excessive rain
combined with saturated ground will lead to higher than
normal runoff. This may cause river levels to exceed minor
flood stage at several locations across the watch area, with
additional river locations exceeding action stage.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
