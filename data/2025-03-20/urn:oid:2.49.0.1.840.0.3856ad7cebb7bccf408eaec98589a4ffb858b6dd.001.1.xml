        <headline>Flood Warning issued March 20 at 10:21PM EDT until March 22 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Indianapolis IN</headline>
        <description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in Indiana...

East Fork White River near Rivervale.

.Recent rainfall of around 1 inch has lead to minor flooding along
the East Fork White River at Rivervale.  Both upstream river gages
and the river level at Rivervale are lower than previously expected,
with Rivervale currently cresting as of Thursday evening at 20.5
feet, thus the forecast has been lowered and flooding is expected to
end Saturday morning.

* WHAT...Minor flooding is occurring and minor flooding is forecast.

* WHERE...East Fork White River near Rivervale.

* WHEN...Until Saturday evening.

* IMPACTS...At 20.5 feet, Lawrenceport Road just east of
Lawrenceport and on the south side of river begins to flood around
this level. During typical floods in this area this portion of the
road can be flooded by 5 to more than 10 feet of water. During the
January 2005 flood this area would have been near the "bottom" of
the river, underwater by nearly 17 feet. In the Great March 1913
flood, more than 25 feet of water would have covered this location.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 9:30 PM EDT Thursday the stage was 20.5 feet.
- Recent Activity...The maximum river stage in the 24 hours
ending at 9:30 PM EDT Thursday was 20.5 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to fall below flood stage
Saturday morning and continue falling and remain below flood
stage.
- Flood stage is 20.0 feet.
