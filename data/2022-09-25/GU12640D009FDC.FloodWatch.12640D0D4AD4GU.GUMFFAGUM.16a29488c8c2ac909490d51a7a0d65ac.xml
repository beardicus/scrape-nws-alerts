<description>...FLASH FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Guam. Rota, Saipan and Tinian.
* WHEN...Through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water crossings may be
flooded. Storm drains and ditches may become clogged with debris.
Flash flooding may occur.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Heavy showers and thunderstorms are associated with a
tropical disturbance embedded within the eastern sector of
the monsoon trough over Tinian and Saipan. Model guidance
continues to trend higher in rainfall totals tonight, with
amounts between 2 and 4 inches with locally heavier amounts
in excess of 4 to 6 inches still possible through tonight.
Even as the tropical disturbance continues to pull away from
the Marianas, an additional 1 to 2 inches of rainfall is
still possible through Monday night.
