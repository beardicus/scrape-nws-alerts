<headline>Flood Advisory issued November 09 at 5:18AM AST  by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 AM AST THIS MORNING...
...REPLACES FLASH FLOOD WARNING...
* WHAT...Urban and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of Puerto Rico, including the following
counties, Carolina and San Juan.
* WHEN...Until 700 AM AST.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
Rises in small streams and normally dry arroyos. Dangerous flows
over low-water crossings. Water over roadways. Overflowing poor
drainage areas. Some low-water crossings may become impassable.
River or stream flows are elevated. Ponding of water in urban or
other areas is occurring or is imminent.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 517 AM AST, Doppler radar indicated that heavy rains have
ended, but light to moderate rains continue to affect the
area. This is causing urban and small stream flooding.
Between 1 and 3 inches of rain have fallen. Emergency
managers have reported various roads affected by flood
waters. For this reason, and considering ongoing excessive
runoff, a Flood Advisory has replaced the Flash Flood
Warning.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
