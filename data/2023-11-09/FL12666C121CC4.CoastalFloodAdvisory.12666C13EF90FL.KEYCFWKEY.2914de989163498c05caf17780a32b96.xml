<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued November 09 at 4:05AM EST until November 09 at 4:00PM EST by NWS Key West</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT...
* WHAT...Moderate saltwater flooding.
* WHERE...Upper Keys.
* WHEN...Through late this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Saltwater flooding of low elevation streets and lots
is expected. Some storm drains will overflow, and some
seawalls and docks will be overtopped. Boaters can expect less
clearance under fixed bridges. Motorists should remember that
persistent puddles around the times of high tide are almost
certain to contain a mix of saltwater.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The relief during the neap tides over the
next couple of days may not be enough to alleviate coastal
flooding impacts across the Upper Keys, as higher amplitude
tides will begin in a few days.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
