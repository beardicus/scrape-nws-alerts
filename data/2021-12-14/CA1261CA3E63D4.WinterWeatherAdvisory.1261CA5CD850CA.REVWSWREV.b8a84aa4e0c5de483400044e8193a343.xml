west of Highway 395 including Mammoth Lakes, and up to 1 inch in
the Chalfant Valley. Winds gusting 30 to 40 mph, with Sierra

* WHEN...From 7 PM Wednesday to 1 PM PST Thursday. Heaviest

Sierra. The hazardous conditions will impact the Thursday
morning commute. Delays likely, road closures possible. Very
strong winds could cause tree damage and even power outages.
Periods of low visibility in blowing snow possible.</description>
<instruction>Even light snowfall causes major travel delays, especially during
periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to
reach your destination. Leave extra space between vehicles since
it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
