impassable. Ponding of water in urban or other areas is occurring
or is imminent.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 726 AM PST, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated heavy rain. This is causing urban and small stream
flooding. Overflowing poor drainage areas have already caused
minor flooding in the advisory area. Between 0.5 and 3.5
inches of rain have fallen.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Malibu, Topanga, Burbank, Pasadena, Azuza, Santa Clarita, and
Beverly Hills.

<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas. The rain will likely trigger
shallow mud and debris flows, minor rock falls, and flooding capable
of localized damage, especially in steep terrain in and near burn
scars.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.
Campers and hikers should avoid streams or creeks.</instruction>
