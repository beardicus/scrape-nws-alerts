<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas. The rain will likely trigger
shallow mud and debris flows, minor rock falls, and flooding capable
of localized damage, especially in steep terrain in and near burn
scars.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
