<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM WEDNESDAY TO 10 AM
PST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Periods of light to moderate snow expected. Total snow
accumulations of 0 to 2 inches for valleys including Reno,
Carson City, and Minden. Accumulations of 2 to 5 inches for
foothill areas including Virginia City, Reno North Valleys, and
west of Carson City. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Greater Reno-Carson City-Minden Area.
* WHEN...From 4 PM Wednesday to 10 AM PST Thursday. Heaviest snow
rates between 9 PM Wednesday and 4 AM Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be difficult due to snow and wind. The
hazardous conditions could impact the Thursday morning commute.
Strong winds could also result in branches falling and localized
power outages.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow may mix with or change to rain in
valleys, which may significantly limit how much snowfall
accumulates.</description>
<instruction>Even light snowfall causes major travel delays, especially during
periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to
reach your destination. Leave extra space between vehicles since
it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
