<description>...Dangerous to Extremely Dangerous fire weather conditions on
Wednesday...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY MORNING THROUGH
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON FOR WIND AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR FIRE
WEATHER ZONES 015 AND 016...
The National Weather Service in Goodland has issued a Fire
Weather Watch for wind and low relative humidity, which is in
effect from Wednesday morning through Wednesday afternoon.
* Affected Area...In Kansas...Fire Weather Zone 015 Sheridan and
Fire Weather Zone 016 Graham.
* Winds...Southwest 35 to 45 mph with gusts up to 70 mph in the
mid morning to very early afternoon hours, shifting to the west
and northwest with gusts up to 60 mph from mid afternoon through
sunset as a cold front moves through.
* Relative Humidity...As low as 14 percent.
* Impacts...Any fires that start will have extreme fire behavior
and spread rapidly. Outdoor burning is not advised. Any fires
that do develop will quickly become out of control. First
responders will need to be mindful of the timing of the expected
abrupt wind shift when fighting any fires. Blowing dust is also
expected and visibilities could be very low. First responders
may be impacted.</description>

are forecast to occur. Listen for later forecasts and possible
red flag warnings.</instruction>
