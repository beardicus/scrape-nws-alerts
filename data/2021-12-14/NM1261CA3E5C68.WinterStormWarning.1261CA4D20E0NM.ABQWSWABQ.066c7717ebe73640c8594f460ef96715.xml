<description>...HIGH WINDS AND BLOWING SNOW WILL CREATE WHITEOUT CONDITIONS EARLY
WEDNESDAY MORNING...
.A strong cold front producing moderate to heavy snow will combine
with very strong winds to produce whiteout conditions and near zero
visibility early Wednesday morning near sunrise. Eight to twelve
inches of snow accumulation is forecast for the high terrain above
9,000 feet, creating hazardous travel along U.S. Highway 64.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 8 PM THIS EVENING TO
11 AM MST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 4 and
8 inches, except up to 12 inches above 9,000 feet. Winds gusting
as high as 70 mph.
* WHERE...Tusas Mountains Including Chama.
* WHEN...From 8 PM this evening to 11 AM MST Wednesday. The worst
winter storm conditions will exist between 4 to 8 am Wednesday
morning.
* IMPACTS...Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will
likely become slick and hazardous. Visibilities may drop below 1/4
mile due to falling and blowing snow. Whiteout conditions are
expected and will make travel treacherous and potentially
life-threatening. Travel could be very difficult. Tire traction
will be reduced. Extend the distance between your vehicle and the
vehicle in front of you. Very strong winds could cause extensive
damage to trees and power lines.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency. For the latest road
conditions, dial 511 or 1.800.432.4269, or visit http://nmroads.com.
Persons should delay all travel if possible. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution and be prepared for sudden
changes in visibility. Leave plenty of room between you and the
motorist ahead of you, and allow extra time to reach your
destination. Avoid sudden braking or acceleration, and be especially
cautious on hills or when making turns. Make sure your car is
winterized and in good working order.</instruction>
