<headline>High Wind Warning issued December 14 at 1:57AM MST until December 15 at 8:00PM MST by NWS Goodland</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM MST /9 AM CST/ TO 8 PM
MST /9 PM CST/ WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Southwest winds of 35 to 50 mph with gusts up to 70 mph
in the morning through very early afternoon, shifting to the
west and northwest with gusts up to 60 mph from early afternoon
through sunset.
* WHERE...Portions of northwest and west central Kansas, east
central and northeast Colorado and southwest Nebraska.
* WHEN...From 8 AM MST /9 AM CST/ to 8 PM MST /9 PM CST/
Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Wind of this magnitude may down trees, power lines,
and damage property. High winds may also create dangerous travel
conditions, especially on high speed limit, high traffic routes
such as Interstate 70. Reduced visibilities associated with
blowing dust may exacerbate already difficult travel conditions
and cause very poor air quality.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...This system will not develop until early
Wednesday morning and, when it does develop, it will do so very
near or directly over the Tri-State area. As a result, a fair
amount of uncertainty persists with regard to both the magnitude
and location of the strongest winds. Hurricane force wind gusts
(at least 75 mph) are possible.</description>
<instruction>People should avoid being outside in forested areas and around
trees and branches. If possible, remain in the lower levels of
your home during the windstorm, and avoid windows. Use caution if
you must drive.</instruction>
