<description>...Winter weather makes a return tonight through Wednesday...
Winter-like conditions will be returning to northern and central
Nevada beginning tonight. The snow showers will be around through
mid-week along with much colder temperatures.
A cold front will push across the area tonight. Any valley rain
showers that develop will quickly turn over to snow as
temperatures drop behind the cold front. Initial amounts for
tonight into Monday evening are a little higher than previous
forecast, especially along the US Highway 50 corridor. Amounts
there will be in the 1 to 4 inch range, though outside of this
area, many valley locations will see up to an inch.
Snow showers will continue each afternoon with light amounts
expected. For the entire period Tuesday through Wednesday, valley
locations could see up to an inch to possibly three inches in
localized areas, while the mountains are expected to see three to
six inches through the entire mid-week period.
Winds will also become breezy to windy from the west and southwest
this evening with gusty northerly winds behind the cold front
tomorrow across central Nevada. Some spots of blowing and
drifting snow are possible, especially on higher passes and
summits.
Temperatures will be below normal for tomorrow and those are
expected to continue through the mid-week with highs below
freezing in many locations Wednesday and lows in some valleys
Thursday morning well into the single digits.
Motorists should remain alert to rapidly changing weather, and
take necessary precautions if travel is necessary.
