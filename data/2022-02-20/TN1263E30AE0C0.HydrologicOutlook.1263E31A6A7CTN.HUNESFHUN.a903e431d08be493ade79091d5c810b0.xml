<description>...Flash Flooding and River Flooding Possible Tuesday through
Friday across the Tennessee Valley...
Several rounds of heavy rainfall are expected this week as a
series of disturbances impact the region. Thunderstorms are also
expected during this time period which will locally increase
rainfall amounts.
Flash flooding will be possible during heavy downpours and in
locations where training of heavy showers and thunderstorms occurs.
Additionally, several days of rainfall will also lead to rises on
area rivers, creeks, and streams. River flooding will be possible,
especially on the tributaries of the mainstem Tennessee River.
Rainfall totals Monday night through Wednesday could reach 1 to 3
inches, with another 1 to 2 inches possible Thursday into Friday.
It is important to note that these values may change depending on
exactly where a front stalls and its possible these numbers could
change in later forecasts.
A Flood Watch may be required for portions of northern Alabama
and southern middle Tennessee for later this week. Residents
should continue to monitor this unfolding weather situation and
stay tuned to further forecast updates from the National Weather
Service.
