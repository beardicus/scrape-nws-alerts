<description>...FLOOD WARNING FOR AN ICE JAM NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 615 PM EST
MONDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam is occurring and is expected
to continue.
* WHERE...A portion of southwest Michigan, including the following
county, Ottawa.
* WHEN...Until 615 PM EST Monday.
* IMPACTS...A significant ice jam has formed on the Grand River near
Robinson Township. Flooding is occuring at low-lying and
flood-prone areas including Limberlost Lane and Van Lopik Avenue.
The ice remains jammed up in this area, and additional shifting of
the ice and thickening of the ice jam is possible this evening and
overnight. This may lead to additional rising water and
significant flooding.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 433 PM EST, local Emergency Officials confirm flooding is
happening and the ice continues to move and shift.
- Ice jams are notoriously unpredictable, and can lead to water
level rising much faster than normal for the Grand River.
Anyone living in this area should prepare for rising water
and flooding, and have a plan to move to safety on very short
notice. The ice jam should slowly move downstream over the
next few days, expanding the flooding risk to downstream of
the highway 231 bridge.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.</instruction>
