<description>...Winter weather makes a return tonight through Wednesday...
The warm and dry weather will end tonight and Monday as winter-
like conditions return to northern and central Nevada. The snow
showers will be around through mid-week.
A band of valley rain and mountain snow showers will push into
northern Elko and Humboldt counties this afternoon and evening,
spreading south and east overnight into Monday morning. As the
colder air filters in behind the cold front, valley rain should
switch over to snow tonight into Monday. Snow showers will
continue each afternoon with light amounts expected. For the
entire period Monday through Wednesday, valley locations could see
up to an inch to possibly three inches in localized areas, while
the mountains are expected to see three to six inches through the
entire mid-week period.
Winds will also become breezy to windy from the west and southwest
today with gusty northerly winds behind the cold front Monday
across central Nevada. Some spots of blowing and drifting snow
are possible, especially on higher passes and summits.
Temperatures on Monday are expected to be 15 to 20 degrees colder
than today, with highs only in the 30s to lower 40s. Colder
temperatures are expected midweek with highs below freezing in
many locations Wednesday and lows in some valleys Thursday
morning well into the single digits.
Motorists should remain alert to rapidly changing weather,
and take necessary precautions if travel is necessary.
