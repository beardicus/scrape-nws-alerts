<instruction>A dense fog advisory means visibilities will frequently be
reduced to less than one quarter mile. If driving, slow down, use
your headlights, and leave plenty of distance ahead of you.
A high wind watch means there is potential for a hazardous high
wind event. Monitor the latest forecasts and warnings for updates
on this situation. Fasten loose objects or shelter objects in a
safe location prior to the onset of winds.</instruction>
