<headline>Red Flag Warning issued February 20 at 1:20PM MST until February 20 at 7:00PM MST by NWS Albuquerque</headline>
<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT TODAY UNTIL 7 PM FOR THE EAST
CENTRAL PLAINS DUE TO STRONG WINDS, LOW HUMIDITY VALUES, AND
UNSTABLE CONDITIONS...
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT MONDAY FROM 10 AM THROUGH 7 PM FOR
LOCALES ALONG AND EAST OF THE CENTRAL MOUNTAINS BELOW SIGNIFICANT
SNOWPACK DUE TO STRONG WINDS, LOW HUMIDITY VALUES, AND UNSTABLE
CONDITIONS...
.Increasing winds in combination with very dry conditions and
fuels, above normal readings, and an unstable atmosphere will
create several hours of critical fire weather conditions across
the east central plains of New Mexico. Expect winds to increase
even further for Monday, allowing for a broad region of critical
fire weather conditions along and east of the central mountains
below significant snowpack. Brief critical conditions could also
develop across southern Socorro County, but fuels may not be as
susceptible for rapid fire growth in this region.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM MST THIS
EVENING...
