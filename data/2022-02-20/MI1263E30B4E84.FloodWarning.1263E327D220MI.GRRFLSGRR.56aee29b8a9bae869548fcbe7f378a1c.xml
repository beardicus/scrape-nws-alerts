<description>...FLOOD WARNING FOR AN ICE JAM REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1130 AM EST
MONDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues.
* WHERE...A portion of south central Michigan, including the
following counties, Clinton, Eaton and Ionia.
* WHEN...Until 1130 AM EST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of low-lying areas along the river continues.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 559 PM EST, based on earlier reports by local Emergency
Management, it is likely that an ice jam on the Grand River
downstream of the Jones road bridge continues. This ice jam
is resulting in flooding at the Jones road bridge and along
other low-lying areas.
- Ice jams are notoriously unpredictable, and can result in
water level changes much faster than typically experienced on
the Grand River. If you live along the river in this area,
pay extra attention to river conditions and have a plan to
respond if water levels start changing quickly.

<instruction>Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
