<description>...HEAVY SNOW ON MONDAY ACROSS CENTRAL MINNESOTA INTO NORTHERN
WISCONSIN FOLLOWED BY WIDESPREAD SNOW THROUGH TUESDAY ACROSS THE
REGION...
.A long duration snowfall event will cause travel impacts across
the region beginning late tonight and lasting through Tuesday. The
heaviest snow will fall along an east, west line across central
Minnesota into northern, namely along and north of a line from
Madison to St Cloud to Hayward. Snowfall amounts in this region
are likely to be in the 10 to 14 inch range, with locally higher
amounts possible. The snow will begin late tonight, and most of
this snow will fall on Monday.
The band of snow will gradually weaken and spread across the rest
of the region late Monday and Monday night, before exiting the
area Tuesday evening. It is in this timeframe when most of the
other locations will see snow. Most locations will see 3 to 6
inches of snow from Monday night through Tuesday.
As mentioned earlier, travel impacts are expected tomorrow through
Tuesday as the snow begins in your location. This will be a
lighter and more fluffy snow. Northeast winds of 20 to 25 mph
will lead to areas of blowing and drifting snow. Please plan on
extra travel time to reach your destination. The latest road
conditions for the state you are calling from can be obtained by
calling 5 1 1. Road conditions can also be found at 511mn.org for
Minnesota or 511wi.gov for Wisconsin.
