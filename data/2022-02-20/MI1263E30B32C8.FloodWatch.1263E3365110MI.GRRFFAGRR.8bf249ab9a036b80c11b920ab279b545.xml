<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR POTENTIAL ICE JAM FLOODING NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH
TUESDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Additional flooding caused by an ice jam on the Grand River
remains possible.
* WHERE...A portion of southwest Michigan, including the following
county, Ottawa.
* WHEN...Through Tuesday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Localized flooding of low lying areas and property along
the Grand River will be possible. Rapid water level fluctuations
may occur due to heavy ice cover on the river and possible ice jam
formation.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- As of Sunday afternoon, a significant ice jam has formed on
the river near the highway 231 bridge, and is causing
flooding in parts of Robinson Township. As this ice jam
slowly moves downriver over the next few days, additional
flooding is possible, including at some areas along the river
that typically don`t have flooding problems.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
