<headline>Heat Advisory issued June 24 at 1:49PM PDT until June 27 at 10:00PM PDT by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...HEAT ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON SATURDAY TO 10 PM
PDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Temperatures 90 to 100 expected.
* WHERE...In Oregon, Lower Columbia, Greater Portland Metro
Area, Upper Hood River Valley, Western Columbia River Gorge
and Central Columbia River Gorge. In Washington, Greater
Vancouver Area, Western Columbia River Gorge and Central
Columbia River Gorge.
* WHEN...From noon Saturday to 10 PM PDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...Hot temperatures may cause heat illnesses to occur.
Rivers are running cold and fast, and will continue to do so
this weekend. Nearly every year, people die in rivers in
southwest Washington and northwest Oregon due to cold water
shock during the season`s first heat wave. Hot temperatures
can make the cool water seem tempting, but river temperatures
in the 50s can easily result in cold water shock that can kill
in minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Sunday will be the hottest day with highs
in the mid to upper 90s, locally near 100. Maximum
temperatures Saturday and Monday are expected to be 90 to 95.
Nighttime temperatures are likely to fall into upper 50s to
mid 60s.</description>
<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
