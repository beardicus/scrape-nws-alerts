<description>...HEAT WAVE NEXT WEEK...
Temperatures soar this weekend and remain high well into mid next
week in Hyder. The warmest days are expected to be Monday into
Wednesday when temperatures could reach into the lower 90s.
Conditions could feel muggy at times as well with a potential for
thunder sometime next week. With around 18 hours of daylight per
day, homes will be difficult to cool in the evenings.
To minimize impacts of the heat wave, locate fans for cooling;
wear light-colored and loose fitting clothes; drink plenty of
fluids, apply sun protection, and take breaks if you must be
outdoors for extended periods; do not leave young children and
pets unattended in closed vehicles; and plan to check on the
elderly, those who are home-bound, and other loved ones and
neighbors who could be more vulnerable.
These warm temperatures will cause glacially fed rivers to
gradually rise each day. Snow and glacier melt water into the
basins will cause cool water temperatures.
