<description>...HEAT WAVE NEXT WEEK...
Temperatures soar late this weekend and remain high into mid next
week across the northern and central Inner Channels. A few
temperature records could fall. The warmest days are expected to
be Monday into Wednesday when temperatures swell well into the
80s. Conditions could feel muggy at times as well. With around 18
hours of daylight per day, homes will be difficult to cool in the
evenings. For details on specific locations important to you, see
the point and click forecast located at weather.gov/juneau.
To minimize impacts of the heat wave, locate fans for cooling;
wear light-colored and loose fitting clothes; drink plenty of
fluids, apply sun protection, and take breaks if you must be
outdoors for extended periods; do not leave young children and
pets unattended in closed vehicles; and plan to check on the
elderly, those who are home-bound, and other loved ones and
neighbors who could be more vulnerable.
These warm temperatures will cause glacially fed rivers to
gradually rise each day. Snow and glacier melt water into the
basins will cause cool water temperatures.
