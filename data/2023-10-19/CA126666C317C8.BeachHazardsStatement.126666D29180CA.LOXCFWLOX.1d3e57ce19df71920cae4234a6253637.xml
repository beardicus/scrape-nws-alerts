<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued October 19 at 7:58PM PDT until October 20 at 9:00PM PDT by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH FRIDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Dangerous rip currents are expected through Friday due
to elevated surf of 3 to 6 feet with local sets to 7 feet. Surf
will slowly subside Friday afternoon and evening. There is a
high risk of dangerous rip currents through Fri evening.
* WHERE...Catalina and Santa Barbara Islands, Malibu Coast and
Los Angeles County Beaches.
* WHEN...Through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...There is an increased risk of ocean drowning. Rip
currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Waves can
wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats
nearshore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Surf will be highest on west and
northwest facing beaches. Nuisance spillover is possible in
parking lots and walkways early Friday afternoon.</description>
<instruction>Remain out of the water due to hazardous swimming conditions, or
stay near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly
in such conditions, so stay off the rocks.</instruction>
