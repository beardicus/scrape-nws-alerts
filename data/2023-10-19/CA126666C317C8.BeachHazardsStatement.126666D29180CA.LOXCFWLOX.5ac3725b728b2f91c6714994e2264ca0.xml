<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued October 19 at 7:58PM PDT until October 20 at 9:00PM PDT by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH FRIDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Dangerous rip currents are expected later today through
Friday due to elevated surf of 3 to 6 feet with local sets to
7 feet on west facing beaches. Surf will slowly subside Friday
afternoon and evening. There is a high risk of dangerous rip
currents through Fri evening.
* WHERE...Santa Barbara County Southwestern Coast and Santa
Barbara County Southeastern Coast.
* WHEN...Through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...There is an increased risk of ocean drowning. Rip
currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Waves can
wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats
nearshore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Surf will be highest on west facing
beaches. Nuisance spillover is possible in parking lots and
walkways around the high tide early Friday afternoon.</description>
<instruction>Remain out of the water due to hazardous swimming conditions, or
stay near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly
in such conditions, so stay off the rocks.</instruction>
