<headline>High Surf Advisory issued October 19 at 4:19AM PDT until October 20 at 9:00PM PDT by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM PDT FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Large breaking waves will build to 6 to 9 feet with local
sets to 10 feet today, continue through Friday, then slowly
subside Friday afternoon and evening. There is a high risk of
dangerous rip currents through Fri evening.
* WHERE...Ventura County Beaches.
* WHEN...Until 9 PM PDT Friday.
* IMPACTS...There is an increased risk for ocean drowning. Rip
currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Large
breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and
rocks, and capsize small boats near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Surf will be highest on west and northwest
facing beaches. Nuisance to minor coastal flooding is possible
around the high tide near noon today, with slightly less of a
chance early Friday afternoon.</description>
<instruction>Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly
locations in such conditions, so stay off the rocks.</instruction>
