<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING FOR THE HERMITS PEAK AND CALF CANYON BURN
SCAR REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM MDT EARLY THIS MORNING FOR

At 212 AM MDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms have ended over
the Hermits Peak and Calf Canyon Burn Scar. Between 0.25 and 1 inch
of rain has fallen.  The heaviest rainfall has occurred from just

burn scar. Runoff will continue, therefore, flash flooding is
ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will impact the Tecolote Creek
and Gallinas River drainage areas. The debris flow can consist of
rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms producing
flash flooding in and around the Hermits Peak and Calf
Canyon Burn Scar.

in the Hermits Peak and Calf Canyon Burn Scar. Severe debris flows
can also be anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may be
washed away in places. If you encounter flood waters, climb to
safety.</instruction>
