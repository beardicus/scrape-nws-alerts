<description>...ACCUMULATING LAKE-EFFECT SNOWFALL CONTINUES THROUGH THE
DAYLIGHT HOURS TODAY...
While snowfall rates have become lighter today than what they were
previously, a fluffy 1 to 3 inches of lake-effect snowfall is
still expected across Alger, northern Schoolcraft, and Luce
counties today, with a few isolated spots possibly receiving up to
4 inches. Snowfall could still accumulate fairly quickly at times
today, possibly as much as half an inch per hour in the heaviest
snow bands. Visibilities could also be reduced down to a half mile
or less in these bands. Therefore, if you are traveling today,
exercise extra caution by looking out for slick road conditions
and turning on your low-beam headlights when you run into reduced
visibilities.</description>
