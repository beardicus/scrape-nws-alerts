<description>...PASSING FRONT TO BRING SNOW TO NORTHERN LYNN CANAL...
.Northerly winds ahead of a gale force front will bring in below
freezing to near freezing temperatures to the northern panhandle
tonight and Wednesday. Wednesday afternoon, a front will bring
moisture to the panhandle that will last into Thursday. As this
moisture collides with the cold air in the north, snow is likely.
For the highway and higher elevations near Haines, heavy snow up
to 6 inches is expected over a 12 to 15 hour time frame.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 3 PM WEDNESDAY TO 6 AM
AKST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 3 to 6
inches. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...Haines Highway and Klukwan.
* WHEN...From 3 PM Wednesday to 6 AM AKST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Light snow will begin along the highway and
near the border Wednesday afternoon before moving east towards
Haines. The heavier snow is expected to be along the highway
with up to 6 inches possible. Heaviest snowfall rates will be
late Wednesday evening into early Thursday morning with rates
around .5&quot; to 1&quot; per hour. For Haines, and areas closer to sea
level, is expected to get lighter amounts of snow, at around 3
inches of snow, with some rain/snow mixing possible.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
People are urged to prepare their property before the onset of
winter weather.
