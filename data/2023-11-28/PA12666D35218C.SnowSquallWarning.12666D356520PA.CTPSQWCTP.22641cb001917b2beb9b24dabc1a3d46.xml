<headline>Snow Squall Warning issued November 28 at 11:27AM EST until November 28 at 1:00PM EST by NWS State College</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in State College PA has issued a
* Snow Squall Warning for...
Northern Clearfield County in central Pennsylvania...
Southeastern Elk County in north central Pennsylvania...
* Until 100 PM EST.
* At 1125 AM EST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from near Brookville to Brockport to 15 miles north of
Clearfield, moving southeast at 15 mph.
HAZARD...Flash freeze on roads. Intense bursts of heavy snow.
Gusty winds leading to blowing snow and rapidly falling
visibility. Wind gusts up to 20 mph.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Dangerous and life-threatening travel conditions are
expected to develop rapidly in the warning area.
For those driving on Interstate 80, this includes areas between the
Dubois and Snow Shoe exits, specifically from mile markers 97 to 138.
This snow squall will be near...
Penfield and Parker Dam State Park around 1130 AM EST.
DuBois and S.B. Elliot State Park around 1140 AM EST.
Lecontes Mills and Sandy around 1150 AM EST.
Karthaus and Rockton around 1210 PM EST.
Plymptonville around 1220 PM EST.
Other locations impacted by this snow squall include Grassflat,
Wallaceton, Weedville, Morrisdale, and Kylertown.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads,
bridges, and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and
be prepared for a sudden loss of traction.
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.
There is no safe place on a highway when a snow squall hits.
Visibility and traction are immediately lost in whiteout conditions,
making it difficult or impossible to slow down and avoid stopped
vehicles. Delay travel or safely exit the highway before the snow
squall arrives.
