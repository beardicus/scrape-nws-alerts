<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 100 PM EST FOR
NORTHERN CLEARFIELD COUNTY...
At 1216 PM EST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line
extending from Brookville to S.B. Elliot State Park to Karthaus,
moving southeast at 15 mph.
HAZARD...Flash freeze on roads. Intense bursts of heavy snow. Gusty
winds leading to blowing snow and visibility rapidly
falling to less than one-quarter mile. Wind gusts up to 20
mph.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Dangerous and life-threatening travel conditions are
expected to develop rapidly in the warning area.
For those driving on Interstate 80, this includes areas between the
Dubois and Snow Shoe exits, specifically from mile markers 97 to 138.
This snow squall will be near...
Clearfield, DuBois, and Lecontes Mills around 1220 PM EST.
Hyde and Woodland around 1230 PM EST.
Other locations impacted by this snow squall include Grassflat,
Wallaceton, Morrisdale, Kylertown, and Treasure Lake.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Wet roadways will quickly freeze. Black ice will cause roads,
bridges, and overpasses to become slick and dangerous. Slow down and
be prepared for a sudden loss of traction.
Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes
your location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra
time. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead
to accidents.
