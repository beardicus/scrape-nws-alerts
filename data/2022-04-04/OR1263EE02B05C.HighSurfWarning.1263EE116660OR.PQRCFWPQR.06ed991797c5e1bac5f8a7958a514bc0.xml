<headline>High Surf Warning issued April 04 at 2:59PM PDT until April 05 at 11:00AM PDT by NWS Portland</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 AM PDT TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Large waves and dangerous surf conditions, with high
potential of sneaker waves. Breakers up to 34 feet.
* WHERE...In Oregon, North Oregon Coast. In Washington, South
Washington Coast.
* WHEN...Until 11 AM PDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Destructive waves may wash over beaches, jetties,
and other structures unexpectedly. People can be swept off
rocks and jetties and drown while observing high surf. Severe
beach erosion may destroy coastal properties and buildings.
Higher than normal water run-up is expected on beaches and low-
lying shoreline.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Highest surf will occur after dark making
it especially difficult to see the rapidly changing conditions
and shifting debris on the beaches. The incoming swells are
coming from near due west.</description>
<instruction>A High Surf Warning means that high surf will affect beaches,
producing rip currents, sneaker waves and beach erosion. Stay
well back from the water`s edge and be alert for exceptionally
high waves.
Keep away from large logs on the beach. Water running up on the
beach can lift or roll logs which can injure or kill someone
caught in their path.</instruction>
