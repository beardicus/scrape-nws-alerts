<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued April 04 at 5:00AM PDT until April 04 at 12:00PM PDT by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON PDT
TODAY...
* WHAT...Wet snow accumulations of 6 to 12 inches. West-
southwest wind gusts 30 to 50 mph in exposed areas such as
across ridges, peaks, and passes.
* WHERE...High Cascades above 5000 feet including Highway 62
near Crater Lake, Highways 138 and 230 near Diamond Lake, and
Highway 58 near Willamette Pass.
* WHEN...Through noon PDT today.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Snow and blowing
snow will reduce visibility, at times, especially in exposed
areas. Gusty winds combined with wet snow could bring down
tree branches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A period of heavy snow with snowfall rates
of an inch per hour or greater is expected this morning (80 to
100 percent chance) this morning. Snow will likely continue into
this afternoon, but road temperatures will warm and impacts to
roadways should lessen.

* Carry tire chains and be prepared for snow covered roads and
limited visibilities.
