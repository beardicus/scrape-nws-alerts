<description>.DISCUSSION...
Wind will increase out of the south through this evening, in advance
of strong low pressure. The combination of very dry air with
relative humidity values falling to around 20 percent, dry fuels,
and breezy winds will result in critical fire weather conditions
across portions of south central South Dakota.
The area of low pressure will shift near the Missouri River shortly
after midnight tonight into Tuesday morning. The result will be
quickly shifting winds from the south to the west and northwest.
Winds will remain breezy, increasing during the day Tuesday out of
the northwest with gusts of 40 to 50 mph. Slightly lighter winds
with gusts closer to 35 mph will remain over west central Minnesota.
While winds will relax east of the James River, they will stay breezy
at night elsewhere. Stronger winds are expected again across the
entire area Wednesday afternoon and Thursday afternoon, with cooler
air and a good chance of moisture.
...EXTREME FIRE DANGER...
Extreme weather conditions and very low moisture content of grasses,
and other dry organic material on the ground, indicate that critical
burning conditions exist.  All fires have the potential to become
large and spread quickly becoming erratic with extreme behavioral
characteristics.
The outlook for Tuesday afternoon...The grassland fire danger index
will reach the extreme category.</description>
