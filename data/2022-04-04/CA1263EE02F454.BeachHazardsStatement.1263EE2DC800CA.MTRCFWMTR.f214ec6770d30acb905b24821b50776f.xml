<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued April 04 at 4:33PM PDT until April 06 at 9:00PM PDT by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>.A moderate period northwest swell arrives overnight with a period
between 14 to 16 seconds with swell heights over 11 feet from
coastal Sonoma County to coastal Monterey County. The swell
arrives over the northern waters early Tuesday morning, moving
southward impacting area beaches through Wednesday evening,
resulting in a high risk of sneaker waves and strong rip currents.
Swell periods will diminish slightly to 13 to 15 seconds on
Wednesday, but the risk for sneaker waves and rip currents will
persist. Additionally during this time period, the high energy of
this swell may result in larger breaking waves in the surf zone
from 18 to 22 feet. Swell heights and periods are expected to
diminish below risk threshold Wednesday overnight into Thursday.
On days with high sneaker wave risk, the ocean can appear deceptively
calm with long lulls between larger wave sets. This may lead to
individuals venturing onto exposed coastal features where infrequent
but powerful waves can overwhelm them, knocking them into the cold,
restless ocean where the possibility of hypothermia or drowning is
severe. Each year, individuals lose their life during similar
sneaker wave events along the California coast. If visiting the
coast this weekend, respect the power of the ocean, remain vigilant
of your surroundings, and avoiding venturing onto exposed coastal
features where sudden, powerful waves can put your life at risk.
And as always, never turn your back to the ocean!
