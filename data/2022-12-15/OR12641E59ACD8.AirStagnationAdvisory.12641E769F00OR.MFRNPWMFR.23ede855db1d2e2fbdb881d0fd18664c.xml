* WHAT...For the Air Stagnation Advisory, stagnant air is
expected, which may lead to deteriorating air quality.
* WHERE... For the Air Stagnation Advisory, inland areas of Coos
County including the Coquille Valley.
* WHEN...Until 4 AM PST Saturday.

https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/map/?wfo=mfr</description>
<instruction>People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with diminished air quality. N95 masks are
effective at filtering out the majority of harmful air
particulates.
State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor
burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be
limited as much as possible. According to state air quality
agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants
close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with
your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
