<headline>Freeze Warning issued December 15 at 2:27AM PST until December 15 at 9:00AM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...FREEZE WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM PST THIS MORNING...
...AIR STAGNATION ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM PST
SATURDAY...
...FREEZE WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH
FRIDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...For the Freeze Warning, sub-freezing temperatures are
expected and locally as low as 27. For the Air Stagnation
Advisory, stagnant air is expected, which may lead to
deteriorating air quality. For the Freeze Watch, sub-freezing
temperatures as low as 31 possible.
* WHERE...For the Freeze Warning, the Coos County coast between
Reedsport and Cape Blanco. This includes Lakeside, Coos Bay,
Bandon, Sixes and surrounding areas. For the Air Stagnation
Advisory, inland areas of Coos County including the Coquille
Valley.
* WHEN...For the Freeze Warning, until 9 AM PST this morning.
For the Air Stagnation Advisory, until 4 AM PST Saturday. For
the Freeze Watch, from late tonight through Friday morning.
* IMPACTS...Frost and freeze conditions will kill crops, other
sensitive vegetation and possibly damage unprotected outdoor
plumbing. Air stagnation is likely to result in diminishing
air quality with time, especially in and near areas with
significant sources of air pollution. Diminished air quality
is likely to cause health issues for people with respiratory
problems if precautions are not taken.

<instruction>Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.
People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with diminished air quality. N95 masks are
effective at filtering out the majority of harmful air
particulates.
State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor
burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be
limited as much as possible. According to state air quality
agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants
close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with
your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
