<headline>Air Stagnation Advisory issued December 15 at 8:53AM PST until December 17 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...AIR STAGNATION ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM PST
SATURDAY...
...FREEZE WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH
FRIDAY MORNING...
...FREEZE WARNING WILL EXPIRE AT 9 AM PST THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...For the Air Stagnation Advisory, stagnant air is
expected, which may lead to deteriorating air quality. For the
Freeze Watch, sub-freezing temperatures as low as 31 possible.
* WHERE...For the Freeze Watch, the Coos County coast between Coos
Bay and Cape Blanco. This includes Coos Bay, Bandon, and
surrounding areas. For the Air Stagnation Advisory, inland
areas of Coos County including the Coquille Valley.
* WHEN...For the Air Stagnation Advisory, until 4 AM PST
Saturday. For the Freeze Watch, from late tonight through
Friday morning.
* IMPACTS...Frost and freeze conditions could kill crops, other
sensitive vegetation and possibly damage unprotected outdoor
plumbing. Air stagnation is likely to result in diminishing
air quality with time, especially in and near areas with
significant sources of air pollution. Diminished air quality
is likely to cause health issues for people with respiratory
problems if precautions are not taken.

<instruction>Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent
freezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should
be wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have
in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-
ground pipes to protect them from freezing.
People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with diminished air quality. N95 masks are
effective at filtering out the majority of harmful air
particulates.
State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor
burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be
limited as much as possible. According to state air quality
agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants
close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with
your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
