<headline>Air Stagnation Advisory issued December 15 at 2:27AM PST until December 17 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...FREEZE WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM PST THIS MORNING...
...AIR STAGNATION ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM PST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...For the Freeze Warning, sub-freezing temperatures are
expected and locally as low as 28. For the Air Stagnation
Advisory, stagnant air is expected, which may lead to
deteriorating air quality.
* WHERE...For the Curry County Coast, including near Brookings.
* WHEN...For the Freeze Warning, until 9 AM PST this morning.
For the Air Stagnation Advisory, until 4 AM PST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Freeze conditions will kill crops and other sensitive
vegetation. Air stagnation is likely to result in diminishing
air quality with time, especially in and near areas with
significant sources of air pollution. Diminished air quality is
likely to cause health issues for people with respiratory
problems if precautions are not taken.

<instruction>Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold.
People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with diminished air quality. N95 masks are
effective at filtering out the majority of harmful air
particulates.
State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor
burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be
limited as much as possible. According to state air quality
agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants
close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with
your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
