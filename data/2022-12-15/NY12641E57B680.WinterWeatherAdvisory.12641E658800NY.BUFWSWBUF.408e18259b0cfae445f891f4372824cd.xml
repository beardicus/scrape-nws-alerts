<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 15 at 4:44AM EST until December 15 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Buffalo</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM EST THIS
EVENING...
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY EVENING
THROUGH TUESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Winter Weather Advisory, mixed precipitation.
Additional snow accumulations of an inch or less and ice
accumulations of around two tenths of an inch. Winds gusting as
high as 55 mph near the Lake Erie shore. For the Winter Storm
Watch, heavy lake effect snow possible. Total snow accumulations
of 9 inches or more possible in the most persistent lake snows.
* WHERE...Chautauqua and Southern Erie counties.
* WHEN...For the Winter Weather Advisory, until 7 PM EST this
evening. For the Winter Storm Watch, from Friday evening
through Tuesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions today, especially in
the sheltered valleys. Travel could then be very difficult in
lake snows across the region later this weekend. Strong gusty
winds could bring down tree branches, potentially causing some
power outages. Travel could be difficult today for high profile
vehicles, mainly on the New York state Thruway.</description>
<instruction>Periods of snow, sleet or freezing rain will result in slippery
roads and limited visibilities. Slow down and use caution while
driving.
Submit snow and ice reports through our website or social media.
Narrow bands of heavy snow could impact portions of the region
this weekend and early next week. Localized travel problems will
be possible.</instruction>
