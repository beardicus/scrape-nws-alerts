<description>...AIR STAGNATION ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 PM PST
FRIDAY...
* WHAT...For the Air Stagnation Advisory, poor air quality. For
the Freezing Fog Advisory, the fog has dissipated and
therefore the freezing fog advisory is canceled.
* WHERE...Yakima Valley.
* WHEN...Until 3 PM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Poor air quality may cause issues for people with

<instruction>People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with high levels of air pollution during
periods of stagnant air.
State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor
burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be
limited as much as possible. According to state air quality
agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants
close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with
your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
