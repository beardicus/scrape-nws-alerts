<headline>Flood Advisory issued February 03 at 6:39PM EST until February 05 at 7:00AM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has issued
a Flood Advisory for the following rivers in North Carolina...
French Broad River At Blantyre affecting Transylvania and
Henderson Counties.
.Approximately 2-4 inches of rain has fallen across the upper French
Broad watershed over the past 24 hours, causing within-bank rises
along the French Broad River and associated tributaries.  While this
rainfall is not enough to cause out-of-bank conditions, additional
rainfall is moving in from the west and is expected to persist
through Friday morning.  Some of this rain will be heavy and an
additional 2-3&quot; of rainfall is likely.  This additional rain will
increase already elevated streamflows and will likely cause some
nuisance flood conditions within the watershed, including along the
French Broad River below Rosman to Brevard, Etowah, Blantyre, and
Horse Shoe.  If rainfall exceeds 3&quot; overnight, Minor Flooding may
occur and begin to impact some roadways.  This may require an
upgrade to a Flood Warning.  Please stay weather aware tonight and
monitor the latest forecasts and stream levels for up-to-date
information.
...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM THIS EVENING TO SATURDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...French Broad River At Blantyre.
* WHEN...From this evening to Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...At 16.0 feet, Minor Flood Stage. Farmland flooding

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 5:30 PM EST Thursday the stage was 10.3 feet and rising
steadily.
