<headline>Flood Advisory issued February 03 at 9:27PM EST until February 06 at 1:52PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM EST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of northeast Georgia, including the following
counties, Habersham and Rabun.
* WHEN...Until 900 AM EST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance to Minor flooding of common, flood-prone areas
is likely.  Expect impacts to low-water crossings, boat-access
areas, low-elevation roadways adjacent to streams, poorly draining
urban areas and intersections, campgrounds, greenways, and parks.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 906 PM EST, Over the past 24 hours, Rabun and Habersham
counties have received anywhere from 2 to 5 inches of
rainfall due to numerous rounds of light to moderate showers.
Fortunately, the area was unusually dry in advance of the
rainfall and area streams and drainages have been able to
accommodate the runoff.  However, additional rounds of
moderate to, at times, heavy rainfall, with rain rates of 1-2
inches per hour, are beginning to move over the area, with
additional heavy showers moving towards the area from
southwest to northeast.  Additional rainfall of 1-3&quot; is
possible through the early overnight hours and this will
cause several streams to approach and exceed bankfull,
causing nuisance to Minor flooding of flood-prone, low-lying
areas.
- The Tallulah River above Lake Burton will likely exceed
bankfull, causing nuisance flooding of adjacent low-lying
areas including around Fred Thompson Road.  Expect the
Tallulah River to exceed 5 feet by 1am and crest between 5
and 6 feet overnight.
The Soque River near Clarkesville is near bankfull and is
beginning to flood adjacent low-lying areas, including around
Pitts Park and Beaver Dam Rd.  Expect the river to crest near
11.1 feet by 10pm but then resume additional rises and make
another crest between 12 and 13 feet later tonight.
Tiger Creek at W Wolf Creek Rd in Lakemont is currently at 2
feet but is rising again in response to the new rounds of
rainfall.  Expect some nuisance flooding along Tiger Creek
overnight as the stream crests between 3 and 5 feet.
Additional rises are possible so please stay away from all
streams and stay weather-aware.
- Some locations that will experience nuisance to Minor
flooding include...
Toccoa, Clayton, Clarkesville, Cornelia, Baldwin, Demorest,
Mount Airy, Alto, Mountain City, Tiger, Dillard, Sky Valley,
Tallulah Falls, Lake Rabun, Lakemont, Lake Burton, Black Rock
Mountain State Park, Raoul and Seed Lake.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
