<description>...Black Ice will be Possible Across Much of the Region Tonight...
Areas of light rain, light freezing rain, sleet, and light snow
will gradually diminish from west to east this evening, as much
drier air begins to spill east ahead of a strong upper level
disturbance that will shift northeast away from the region. While
temperatures have fallen below freezing across much of East Texas,
Southeast Oklahoma, and Southwest Arkansas, subfreezing temperatures
will eventually spread into North Louisiana and portions of Deep
East Texas this evening, as the precipitation diminishes. Many
roadways, bridges, and overpasses will remain wet as temperatures
fall below freezing across North Louisiana and Deep East Texas,
with black ice developing over these areas tonight, and persisting
across the remainder of the region as well. The black ice is
expected to linger through much of the morning Friday, until
temperatures are able to climb back above freezing areawide by
late morning into the afternoon.
Motorists that must drive tonight through Friday morning are
urged to slow down and allow for extra travel time during their
commute. Be especially cautious when driving over bridges and
overpasses, as well as some secondary, less traveled roadways, as
these areas will be the most susceptible for black ice formation.</description>
