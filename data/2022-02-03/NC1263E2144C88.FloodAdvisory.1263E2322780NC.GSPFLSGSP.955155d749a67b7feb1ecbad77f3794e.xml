<headline>Flood Advisory issued February 03 at 11:34PM EST until February 05 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...The Flood Advisory is extended for the following rivers in North
Carolina...
French Broad River At Blantyre affecting Transylvania and
Henderson Counties.
.Approximately 3-5 inches of rain have fallen across the upper
French Broad watershed over the past 24 hours, causing significant
rises along the French Broad River and associated tributaries.  The
heaviest rainfall has departed the area but additional rounds of
light to moderate rainfall are expected through Friday morning.
Therefore, it will take many hours for excessive runoff to subside
and for tributaries to crest and begin their recession.  These high
flows are causing the upper French Broad River to exceed bankfull,
resulting in scattered nuisance flooding from Rosman to Brevard,
Etowah, Blantyre, and Horse Shoe.  It is increasingly likely that
the French Broad River near Blantyre will exceed the Minor Flood
Stage of 16.0 feet during the day on Friday, causing widespread
flooding of adjacent low-lying farmland and isolated flooding of
adjacent roadways.  If confidence increases overnight that the river
will exceed 16.5 feet, this Flood Advisory will be upgraded to a
Flood Warning.  Please stay weather aware tonight and monitor the
latest forecasts and stream levels for up-to-date information.
...FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL SATURDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Nuisance flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
Minor flooding is possible later tonight through Friday.
* WHERE...French Broad River At Blantyre.
* WHEN...Until Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...At 16.0 feet, Minor Flood Stage. Farmland flooding
continues on both sides of the French Broad River. Floodwaters
begin to impact boat access areas at Grove Bridge Rd. and Crab
Creek Rd.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 10:30 PM EST Thursday the stage was 13.5 feet and rising
steadily.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above Minor Flood
Stage late tomorrow morning to a crest between 16.5 and 17.0
feet tomorrow evening. It will then fall below Minor Flood
Stage late Saturday morning.
- Action/Advisory Stage is 15.0 feet.
- Minor Flood Stage is 16.0 feet.
