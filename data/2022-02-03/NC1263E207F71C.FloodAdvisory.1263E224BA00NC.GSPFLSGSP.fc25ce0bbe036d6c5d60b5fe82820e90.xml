<headline>Flood Advisory issued February 03 at 6:51PM EST until February 05 at 7:00AM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has issued
a Flood Advisory for the following rivers in North Carolina...
Tuckasegee River At Bryson City affecting Swain County.
.Approximately 2-4 inches of rain has fallen across the Oconaluftee
and Tuckasegee watersheds over the past 24 hours which is causing
significant rises along area streams.  Additional rainfall of 1-2
inches is expected overnight, which will likely cause some streams,
including the Tuckasegee River near Bryson City, to exceed bankfull
and cause nuisance flooding of adjacent, low-lying areas tonight
into early Friday morning.  Rainfall exceeding 2 inches overnight
may cause more significant rises and Minor Flooding may be possible,
requiring an upgrade to a Flood Warning.  Please stay weather aware
tonight and monitor the latest forecasts and stream levels for
up-to-date information.

* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
