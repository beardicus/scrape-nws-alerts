<description>...BERG GLACIER DAMMED LAKE IS RELEASING AND COULD CAUSE HIGH
WATER IN CONTROLLER BAY AND NEARBY COASTAL WATERS...
Satellite observations indicate that the Berg glacier dammed lake,
located 65 miles east of Cordova has released at some point between
August 8th and 15th. This lake releases downstream into the
Gandil River, Bering River and Bering Lake. Though a volume
estimate is impossible, in past events the Bering River has
crested seven to eleven feet above baseflow. High water from this
glacier dammed lake release usually lasts for seven days with
large areas flooded between Bering and Starodubtsov Lakes.
Mariners in the Controller Bay area should anticipate debris in
the water as a result of the flooding.</description>
