<description>...ISOLATED TO SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS EXPECTED THIS WEEK...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
THURSDAY EVENING FOR FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS...
The National Weather Service in Medford has issued a Fire Weather
Watch, which is in effect from Thursday afternoon through
Thursday evening.
* IMPACTS...Any fires that develop have a high probability of
spreading rapidly. Abundant lightning can also ignite new
fires and strain fire fighting resources.
* AFFECTED AREAS...In Oregon...eastern portions of Fire weather
zone 617...eastern and southeastern portions of Fire weather
zone 622 and Fire weather zone 625. This includes portions of
the Umpqua National Forest, foothill areas in eastern Jackson
County and near Ashland, and BLM land in eastern Lake County.
* THUNDERSTORMS...Isolated showers and thunderstorms are expected
today through Thursday morning. Then, the potential increases
for thunderstorms with a mix of isolated to scattered
thunderstorms expected Thursday afternoon and evening. Storms
will be a hybrid of wet/dry today, then trend wetter on
Thursday, but lightning strikes outside of the wet cores are
still likely.
* OUTFLOW WINDS...Gusts 30 to 40 mph.
* DETAILED URL...View the hazard area in detail at

<instruction>If you have not packed your evacuation kit yet, now is the time
to do so. This includes items like important documents and
essentials you cannot live without. Fill your vehicle`s fuel
tank. Visit ready.gov/kit for more information.
Plan now to avoid using equipment that could cause sparks during
the period when critical weather conditions are possible. Visit
weather.gov/medford/wildfire for links to fire restrictions in
your area.
A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are possible during the valid watch time. These conditions could
promote the rapid spread of wildfires which could become life-
threatening. Check weather.gov/medford for forecast updates and a
possible upgrade of the this watch to a Red Flag Warning.</instruction>
