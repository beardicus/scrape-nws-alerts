<description>...MODERATE TO HEAVY RAIN OVER NORTHERN MONROE COUNTY...
At 214 AM EDT, an area of moderate to heavy rain was located falling
from Charlotte to Greece and North Gates. The area of rain is nearly
stationary. Total rainfall of 2 to 3 inches has occurred in this
area since Tuesday evening. Though not widespread, an additional 0.5
to 0.75 inch of rain will occur locally early this morning in some
of these same areas.
Locations impacted include...
Rochester, Greece, Irondequoit, Hilton, Brighton, Gates-North Gates,
Spencerport, Charlotte, Strong Memorial Hospital, Rochester General
Hospital, Rochester International Airport, and Braddock Bay.
This additional rain will cause ponding of water on roadways,
especially in urban areas or low-lying areas with poor drainage.
Motorists should slow down and be prepared for poor visibility due
to the heavy rain.
Remember, never drive across a flooded roadway since the water may
be deeper than it looks. Turn around, don`t drown.</description>
