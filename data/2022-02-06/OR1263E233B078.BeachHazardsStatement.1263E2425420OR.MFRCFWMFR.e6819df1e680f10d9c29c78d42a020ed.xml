<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM PST THIS
AFTERNOON THROUGH 10 PM PST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...An elevated threat for hazardous sneaker waves expected.
* WHERE...Beaches along the southern Oregon Coast, including the
beaches of Douglas, Coos and Curry Counties.
* WHEN...From 1 PM PST this afternoon through 10 PM PST this
evening.
* IMPACTS...Even during calm conditions, sneaker waves can sweep
up the beach without warning and knock unsuspecting people
over and pull them out to sea. Shock and hypothermia can occur
quickly in the cold Pacific waters. In addition, logs and
other debris can be lifted and carried by the waves, crushing
or entrapping unsuspecting victims underneath.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The sneaker wave threat is highest during
high tide this afternoon, which occurs between 3 and 4 pm PST.
Waves will gradually lower as the tide goes out this evening.
