<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 AM EDT TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of western North Carolina, including the
following county, Rutherford.
* WHEN...Until 200 AM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance to Minor flooding of low-lying areas adjacent
to streams and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland,
greenways, parks, boat-access areas, golf courses, low-water
crossings, and low-lying roadways.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1054 PM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated heavy rain due to thunderstorms in a very localized
area between Bostic and Sunshine.   Nuisance to Minor
flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly in the
Advisory area. Between 1 and 2 inches of rain has fallen in
about 60-90 minutes, but totals up to 5 inches were reported
via rain gauge in a very isolated location along Puzzle Creek
near Walker Mill Rd and Terry Rd.
- Heavy rainfall has ended across the Advisory area.  However,
additional rainfall is expected overnight.  This additional
rain may exacerbate ongoing flooding or cause new flooding to
develop.  A Flash Flood Warning may be required due to wet
antecedent conditions.  Please stay weather aware and be
prepared to seek higher ground should heavy rain develop.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Forest City, Spindale, Bostic, Alexander Mills and Sunshine.</description>
