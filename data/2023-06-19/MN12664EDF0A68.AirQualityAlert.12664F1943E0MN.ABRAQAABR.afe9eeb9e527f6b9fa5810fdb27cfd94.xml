<headline>Air Quality Alert issued June 19 at 3:42PM CDT  by NWS Aberdeen</headline>
<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT FROM 12 PM CDT TUESDAY THROUGH 9 PM
CDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has issued an Air
Quality Alert for ozone pollution. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is
expected to reach the Orange or Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups
category.
* WHERE...Western Minnesota.
* WHEN...From 12 PM CDT Tuesday through 9 PM CDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease
(including asthma), heart disease, children and older adults, and
people who are active outdoors, may experience health effects.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Ground-level ozone is expected to be high
during the afternoon hours on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday across
central and southern Minnesota. Sunny skies, warm temperatures, and
low humidity will create an environment favorable for two types of
pollutants (Volatile Organic Compounds and Nitrogen Oxides) to react
in the air to produce ground-level ozone. These pollutants will be
transported by southerly winds from the Chicago area, northeast Iowa,
and southeast Minnesota. Ozone will be highest during the afternoon
and early evening hours when sunshine is most abundant, and
temperatures are highest. Ozone will be low in the morning, late
evening, and overnight.
Ozone levels are expected to reach the orange air quality index (AQI)
category, a level considered unhealthy for sensitive groups, across
western Minnesota. The alert area includes Ortonville. In the orange
area, sensitive groups should limit prolonged outdoor exertion.

<instruction>Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including
asthma), heart disease, children and older adults, and people who are
active outdoors, should limit prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion.

as outdoor burning, and use of residential wood burning devices.
Reduce vehicle trips and vehicle idling as much as possible.</instruction>
