* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A low pressure area dropping down over the Southeast tonight
is expected to stall to our west and southwest on Tuesday,
then linger there through the better part of the week. This
low pressure system will send periods of showers and storms
across the forecast area through at least Thursday, resulting
in widespread rainfall that may eventually cause flooding,
particularly along and near the Blue Ridge Escarpment in
North Carolina.

<instruction>A Flood Watch for flash flooding means there is a potential for
rapid onset flooding based on current forecasts. Flash flooding is a
very dangerous situation and may impact areas that do not typically
flood. Please monitor the latest forecasts and be prepared to take
action quickly should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.
Rainfall of more than five inches in similar storms has been
associated with an increased risk of landslides and rockslides. If
you live on a mountainside or in a cove at the base of a mountain,
especially near a stream, be ready to leave in advance of the storm
or as quickly as possible should rising water, moving earth, or
rocks threaten. Consider postponing travel along mountain roads
during periods of heavy rainfall.</instruction>
