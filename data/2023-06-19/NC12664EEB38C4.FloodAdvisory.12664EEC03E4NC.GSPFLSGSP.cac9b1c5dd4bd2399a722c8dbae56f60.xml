<headline>Flood Advisory issued June 19 at 8:25PM EDT until June 20 at 1:45AM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 215 AM EDT TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Nuisance to Minor flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
expected.
* WHERE...A portion of piedmont North Carolina, including the
following counties, Cabarrus and Mecklenburg.
* WHEN...Until 215 AM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance to Minor flooding of low-lying areas adjacent
to streams and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland,
greenways, parks, boat-access areas, golf courses, low-water
crossings, underpasses, and low-lying roadways and parking lots.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 819 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicated torrential rain due to
thunderstorms. These thunderstorms are producing significant
amounts of rainfall in very short periods of time.  One to
two inches of rainfall will occur over the next 60-90 minutes
with isolated areas of three inches possible.  This rainfall
will quickly overwhelm small drainages and cause nuisance
flooding of adjacent low-lying areas quickly.  Minor flooding
is ongoing or expected to begin shortly in the Advisory area.
- Due to training nature of these thunderstorms, significant
rainfall is possible and flash flooding may occur.  This
Flood Advisory may be upgraded to a Flash Flood Warning.
Please stay weather aware and away from all streams and
adjacent low-lying areas.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Uptown Charlotte, Huntersville, Kannapolis, Downtown Concord,
Central Charlotte, South Charlotte, Northeast Charlotte, East
Charlotte, Southwest Charlotte, Northwest Charlotte, West
Concord, Matthews, Mint Hill, Davidson, Pineville,
Harrisburg, University City, Reedy Creek Park, Hidden Valley
and The Plaza.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.</instruction>
