<senderName>NWS Hastings (North Central Kansas and South Central Nebraska)</senderName>
<headline>Flood Watch issued June 19 at 9:50AM CDT until further notice by NWS Hastings</headline>
<description>...The Flood Watch continues for the following rivers in Nebraska...
Platte River UNDER Darr affecting Dawson County.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
&amp;&amp;
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY AFTERNOON UNTIL
FURTHER NOTICE...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is possible.
* WHERE...Platte River near Darr, with this watch valid for the
stretch of the river from the Dawson-Lincoln County line,
downstream to near Lexington.
* WHEN...From Tuesday afternoon until further notice.
* IMPACTS...At 10.0 feet, flooding of the low lying land right along
the river can be expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 9:00 AM CDT Monday the stage was 9.5 feet and was rising
very slowly.
- Forecast...Due to significant recent precipitation upstream
along the South Platte River, particularly in Colorado,
elevated water levels are gradually working east, along the
Platte River in Nebraska.  If the current forecast remains on
track, the gauge near Darr could reach minor flood stage of
10.0 feet Tuesday afternoon and perhaps continuing to rise to
a crest around 10.7 feet on Thursday before slowly falling.
Uncertainty remains with this river forecast.
- Flood stage is 10.0 feet.
