<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued November 08 at 3:01PM AKST until November 09 at 9:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM AKST
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Snow. Additional snow accumulations of up to 6 inches.
* WHERE...Western Kenai Peninsula, mainly from Clam Gulch north.
* WHEN...Until 9 AM AKST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be hazardous.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Light snow this morning is expected to
become heavier by late afternoon. Several inches of snow
accumulation is expected through late Wednesday evening before
a changeover to rain sometime after midnight. The rain could
be heavy Thursday morning causing very slick roads with rain
on ice as well as ponding of water. There is a chance the
precipitation type remains mostly snow which would result in
higher snowfall amounts, but it looks more likely rain will be
the predominant precipitation type Thursday morning.</description>
