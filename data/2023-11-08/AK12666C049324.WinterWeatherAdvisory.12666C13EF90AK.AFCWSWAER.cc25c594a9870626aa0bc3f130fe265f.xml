<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON AKST
THURSDAY...

accumulations of 3 to 6 inches with locally higher amounts along
the Anchorage Hillside. Heavy rain on snow and ice tonight and
Thursday morning.
* WHERE...Anchorage.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Light snow this morning is expected to
become heavier by mid to late afternoon. Several inches of snow
accumulation is expected through late Wednesday evening before a
changeover to rain. The rain could be heavy overnight causing
very slick roads with rain on ice as well as ponding of water.
There is a chance the precipitation type remains mostly snow
which would result in higher snowfall amounts, but it looks
more likely rain will be the predominant precipitation type
tonight into Thursday.</description>
