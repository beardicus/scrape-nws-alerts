<headline>Red Flag Warning issued November 08 at 9:28AM PST until November 09 at 6:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM TO 6 PM THURSDAY FOR MOST
MOUNTAIN AND VALLEY AREAS OF LOS ANGELES AND VENTURA COUNTIES AS
WELL AS THE MALIBU COAST DUE TO GUSTY SANTA ANA WINDS AND LOW
HUMIDITY...
.Gusty Santa Ana winds and low humidities will impact portions of
Los Angeles and Ventura counties through Thursday. The current
north to northeast winds will shift to more northeasterly and peak
later tonight into Thursday morning, then gradually decrease
Thursday afternoon through Friday. Humidity levels will gradually
lower as well. As a result, the chance of reaching six or more
hours of low humidity and gusty wind combinations is 20 percent
for today but 70 percent for tonight through Thursday. The
previous Fire Weather Watch has therefore been upgraded to a Red
Flag Warning for the same time period and areas.

prone valleys and hills.
