<description>...Increasing Probability Of A Series Of Impactful Storms Sunday
Through Thursday...
There is increasing probability for a series of Bering Sea storms
to impact the West Coast and Western Interior from Sunday through
Thursday.
The first system will bring a strong front to the West Coast on
Sunday with heavy snow, south, southeast, and southwest winds
gusting as high as 50 mph, and snow possibly changing to rain late
Sunday. At this time elevated water levels are possible, though
likely to be higher with the second system.
A second, stronger system looks to impact the region Tuesday
through Thursday. This system will bring the possibility of
coastal flooding with the highest water levels likely south of
the Bering Strait, as well as heavy snow potentially changing to
rain, and south and southwest winds gusting as high as 60 mph.
Water levels are still highly uncertain and will be tracked
closely going into this weekend.
There is still significant uncertainty with both storm systems,
and residents should stay alert for additional updates to the
forecast and prepare for stormy weather late this weekend into
next week.</description>
