<description>...STRONG LAKE EFFECT SNOW BAND CONTINUES TO AFFECT ONEIDA
COUNTY...
HAZARDS...A lake effect snow band accompanied by winds of 25 MPH
which can rapidly reduce visibility to less than a quarter of a mile.
This lake effect snow band is producing extremely heavy snow at the
rate of 1 to 2 inches per hour.
LOCATION AND MOVEMENT...At 908 AM EST, A lake effect snow band
covered most of northern Oneida County. Its expected northward drift
has been slow to materialize, and this may result in higher snow
totals in some places, such as Camden, Lee, and Delta Lake. Further
south, although advisories are still in effect, accumulating snow is
expected to stay north of the New York Thruway, including Syracuse
and Utica, through the afternoon. The band will drop south into the
Thruway corridor this evening.
LOCATIONS IMPACTED INCLUDE...
Syracuse, Clay, Rome, Cicero, Lysander, Van Buren, Oneida,
Baldwinsville, North Syracuse and Lee.
This includes the following highway exits...
Interstate 90 between 32 and 39.
New York Interstate 81 near 22, 23A and B, and between 25 and 30.
SAFETY INFO...
The snow will accumulate so rapidly that it will be extremely
difficult for the road crews to keep the roads clear.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time to reach your destination.
