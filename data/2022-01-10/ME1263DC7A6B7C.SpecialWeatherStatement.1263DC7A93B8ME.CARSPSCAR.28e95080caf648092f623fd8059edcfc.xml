<headline>Special Weather Statement issued January 10 at 2:27AM EST  by NWS Caribou</headline>
<description>...An area of heavy snow showers will affect northeast and east
central Aroostook County...
At 226 AM EST...An area of heavy snow showers was along a line
extending from 17 miles northeast of Limestone to near Portage Lake
to 18 miles southwest of Allagash Township...and moving southeast at
30 MPH.
Locations impacted include...
Presque Isle, Caribou, Fort Fairfield, Limestone, Portage, Mapleton,
Washburn, Mars Hill, Ashland, Easton, Woodland, Bridgewater, Portage
Lake, Masardis, Russel Crossing, Big Machias Lake, Loring, Scopan,
Nashville Plantation and Blaine.
This includes the following highways...
US Highway 1 between Blaine and Caribou.
State Highway 11 between Masardis and Portage.
* Winds in excess of 35 mph are possible with this area of heavy
snow showers.
* Visibilities will drop quickly to less than a half mile in this
area of heavy snow showers.
Travel is not advised during these heavy snow showers. Rapid
visibility reduction and potentially icy roads are likely to lead to
accidents. Consider delaying travel until the snow showers pass your
location. If traveling pull off to a safe location.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time when traveling.</description>
