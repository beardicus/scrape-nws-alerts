<description>...An area of heavy snow showers will affect east central Aroostook
County...
At 330 AM EST...An area of heavy snow showers was along a line
extending from 11 miles northeast of Bridgewater to near Mars Hill to
near Ashland...and moving southeast at 40 MPH.
Locations impacted include...
Houlton, Mars Hill, Bridgewater, Masardis, Scopan, Dudley Township,
Littleton, Monticello, Blaine, Ludlow, Number Nine Mountain and Saint
Croix.
This includes the following highways...
US Highway 1 between Littleton and Blaine.

* Winds in excess of 25 mph are possible with this area of heavy
snow showers.
* Visibilities will drop quickly to less than a half mile in this
area of heavy snow showers.
Travel is not advised during these heavy snow showers. Rapid
visibility reduction and potentially icy roads are likely to lead to
accidents. Consider delaying travel until the snow showers pass your
location. If traveling pull off to a safe location.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time when traveling.</description>
