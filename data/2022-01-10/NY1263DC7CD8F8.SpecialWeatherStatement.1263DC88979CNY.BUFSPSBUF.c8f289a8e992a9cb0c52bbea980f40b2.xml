<description>...AN INTENSE BAND OF LAKE EFFECT SNOW WILL AFFECT PARTS OF OSWEGO
AND LEWIS COUNTIES...
HAZARDS...An intense band of lake effect snow will continue to drift
slowly south through Oswego and far southern Lewis counties through
early evening. Extremely heavy snowfall rates of 3 to 4 inches per
hour are likely in this band. This will make travel very difficult,
or even nearly impossible along Interstate 81 from Parish to Sandy
Creek.
LOCATION AND MOVEMENT...The band of snow over northern Oswego and
far southern Lewis counties will continue to drift south. Travel
will deteriorate farther south in Oswego County as the band moves
south.
LOCATIONS IMPACTED INCLUDE...
Oswego, Pulaski, Redfield, Highmarket, Nine Mile Point, Hastings,
Scriba, Richland, Palermo, New Haven, Mexico, Williamstown,
Lyonsdale, Orwell, Sandy Creek and Port Leyden.
This includes Interstate 81 between exits 33 and 37.
SAFETY INFO...Use extra caution if you must travel into or through
this band of intense lake effect snow. If you must travel, be
prepared for severe winter driving conditions with deep snow cover
on roads and near zero visibility.
