<description>...HIGH SURF WARNING FOR NORTH AND WEST FACING SHORES OF NIIHAU,
KAUAI, OAHU, AND MOLOKAI; NORTH FACING SHORES OF MAUI; AND WEST
FACING SHORES OF THE BIG ISLAND...
.A large northwest swell has peaked and will briefly drop below
warning levels. However, a new larger swell will arrive by
tonight and quickly push surf heights above the warning level yet
again for the north and west facing shores of Niihau, Kauai,
Oahu, and Molokai; the north facing shores of Maui; and west
facing shores of the Big Island.
...HIGH SURF WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM HST TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Surf of 8 to 12 feet.
* WHERE...West facing shores of the Big Island.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM HST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...High. Expect ocean water occasionally sweeping
across portions of beaches, very strong breaking waves, and
strong longshore and rip currents. Breaking waves may
occasionally impact harbors making navigating the harbor
channel dangerous.</description>
<instruction>Large, breaking surf, significant shorebreak, and dangerous
currents make entering the water very hazardous.
Anyone entering the water could face significant injury or death.
Boaters should be aware of an increased number of surfers and
body boarders utilizing the harbor channel to access surfing
areas.</instruction>
