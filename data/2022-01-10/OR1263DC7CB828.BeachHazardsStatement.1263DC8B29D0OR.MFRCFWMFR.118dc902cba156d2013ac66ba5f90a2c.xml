<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM to 9 AM PST
TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Higher threat for sneaker waves expected.
* WHERE...Beaches along the southern Oregon Coast, including the
beaches of Douglas, Coos and Curry Counties.
* WHEN...From 1 AM to 9 AM PST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Even during calm conditions, sneaker waves can sweep
up the beach without warning and knock unsuspecting people
over and pull them out to sea. Shock and hypothermia can occur
quickly in the cold Pacific waters. In addition, logs and
other debris can be lifted and carried by the waves, crushing
or entrapping unsuspecting victims underneath.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Sneaker waves have the ability to run
farther up the beach than usual. The sneaker wave threat is
highest during high tide Tuesday morning, around 6 am PST. Waves
will gradually lower as the tide goes out by Tuesday afternoon.
