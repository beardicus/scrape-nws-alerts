possible.

the cities of Ketchikan And Metlakatla.
* WHEN...Through this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Flooding may occur in poor drainage areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Heavy rain is falling across the area with over 2.5 inches
since it changed from snow to rain Saturday night. This rain
has already caused the snow depth to decrease from 25 inches
down to 16 inches as of 3pm Sunday near Ketchikan. Additional
rainfall of 1 to 2 inches through Monday afternoon on a deep
primed snowpack will continue the rapid snowmelt, increased
runoff, and possible ponding of water and localized flooding.
Flows in rivers may also increase quickly and reach critical
levels.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
