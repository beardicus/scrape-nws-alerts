<description>...HEAVY LAKE EFFECT SNOW CONTINUES TO AFFECT ONEIDA COUNTY NORTH OF
THE THE THRUWAY...
At 1205 PM EST, a wide band of heavy snow was located over northern
Oneida County, north of the NY Thruway. While light snow
occasionally reaches as far south as Rome and Utica, the heaviest
snowfall is over the northwest corner of the county, including the
communities of Camden, Glenmore, and Florence. Snowfall rates may
exceed 2 inches per hour at times in these areas, with near zero
visibility. The snowfall is likely to continue to affect the same
area over the next couple of hours, with a slow, temporary drift to
the north expected after 2 PM.
SAFETY INFO... Use extreme caution if you must travel into or
through this band of heavy snow. Rapid changes in visibility and
potentially slick roads may lead to accidents.
The snow will accumulate so rapidly that it will be extremely
difficult for the road crews to keep the roads clear.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time to reach your destination.
