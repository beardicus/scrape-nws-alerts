<headline>High Surf Warning issued January 10 at 11:30AM HST until January 11 at 6:00PM HST by NWS Honolulu</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF WARNING FOR NORTH AND WEST FACING SHORES OF NIIHAU,
KAUAI, OAHU, AND MOLOKAI; NORTH FACING SHORES OF MAUI; AND WEST
FACING SHORES OF THE BIG ISLAND...
.A large northwest swell has peaked and will briefly drop below
warning levels. However, a new larger swell will arrive by
tonight and quickly push surf heights above the warning level yet
again for the north and west facing shores of Niihau, Kauai, Oahu,
and Molokai; the north facing shores of Maui; and west facing
shores of the Big Island.
...HIGH SURF WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM HST TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Surf heights along north facing shores of Maui will range
from 20 to 25 feet today. Surf along north facing shores will
rise again from tonight through Tuesday peaking in the 30 to 40
foot range.
* WHERE...North facing shores of Maui.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM HST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...High. Expect ocean water occasionally sweeping across
portions of beaches, very strong breaking waves, and strong
longshore and rip currents. Breaking waves may occasionally
impact harbors making navigating the harbor channel dangerous.</description>
<instruction>Large, breaking surf, significant shorebreak, and dangerous
currents make entering the water very hazardous.
Anyone entering the water could face significant injury or death.
Boaters should be aware of an increased number of surfers and
body boarders utilizing the harbor channel to access surfing
areas.</instruction>
