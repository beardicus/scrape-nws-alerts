<description>...RAIN AND HIGH FREEZING LEVELS ON TOP OF A HIGH SNOWPACK COULD
PROMPT NUISANCE FLOODING INTO MONDAY...
Light to moderate rain continues across the southern panhandle. With
a deep snow pack in many locations across the southern Panhandle,
nuisance flooding could develop in parts of the southern
Panhandle from the rain combined with rapid snow melt. A flood
watch has been posted for the Ketchikan area as confidence is
higher for significant ponding and yard flooding, given the heavy
rain forecasted over the deep snow pack. Other areas could develop
issues as well. Otherwise, surface conditions will become very
slippery. Unplowed areas will become difficult to pass. In
addition, heavy snow loads on roof- tops, boats, and idle aircraft
will be challenged by the heavy rains for Monday. While nuisance
flooding could occur, no flooding of rivers and streams is
expected.</description>
