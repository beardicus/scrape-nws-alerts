<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 345 AM PST EARLY THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by heavy rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of southwest California, including southern and
Central Los Angeles County and southeastern Ventura County.
* WHEN...Until 345 AM PST.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of low-lying and poor drainage areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1241 AM PST, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated that an area of moderate to heavy rain and isolated
thunderstorms have moved into southern Los Angeles County.
This area will continue to shift a bit more to the north and
west, pushing into central Los Angeles County and
southeastern Ventura County. Rainfall rates of 0.20 to 0.40
inches per hour are expected through the early morning hours,
with local rates up to 0.75 inches per hour at times and near
any thunderstorms.
Between 1 and 3 inches of rain have already fallen in much of
this area, with local totals over 4 inches, and ponding of
water on roadways and flooding of low lying areas has been
reported.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 0.5 to 1.5 inches are expected
over the area. This additional rain will result in widespread
ponding of water on area roadways and flooding of low lying
areas and intersections. There may be rises and flooding of
some creeks and streams. Rocks and
boulders may fall onto roadways, especially below steep
terrain.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Long Beach, Thousand Oaks, Malibu, Acton, Burbank, Pasadena,
Glendale, Torrance, Universal City, North Hollywood,
Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Van Nuys, Downtown Los Angeles,
Encino, Culver City, Santa Monica, Woodland Hills and
Northridge.
