SUNDAY FOR TURNAGAIN PASS...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected and blizzard-like conditions. Total
snow accumulations up to 20 inches in Turnagain Pass. Winds
gusting as high as 45 mph in combination with heavy snow will
will reduce visibility due to falling and blowing snow.
* WHERE...Turnagain Pass
* WHEN...Until 3 AM AKST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Areas of blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility. Rain on snow covered
roadways will create slushy and icy conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow levels along the Seward highway
tonight will remain between sea level and approximately 600 ft,
with the higher snow levels near Seward. Snow levels will then
rise to 800 to 1200 ft through the day Saturday. Rain falling on
recent snow will create hazardous travel conditions. Snow
accumulations from Seward north to Summit Lake will be highly
dependent on the transition to rain. Accumulations of 8-12
inches are possible from Moose Pass north to Summit Lake. Cold
air will then return through the day Sunday, returning snow
levels to near sea level and refreezing water on area roadways.</description>

conditions will make travel very hazardous. If you must travel,
keep an extra flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case
of an emergency.
