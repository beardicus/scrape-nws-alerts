<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 22 at 3:16AM MST until December 23 at 5:00PM MST by NWS Tucson</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 8 PM THIS
EVENING TO 5 PM MST SATURDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow is expected above 8000 feet. Total snow
accumulations between 6 and 12 inches are expected above 8000
feet in the Pinaleno and White Mountains, with 4 to 8 inches
expected above 8000 feet on the Catalina and Rincon Mountains.
* WHERE...White Mountains in northern Graham and northern Greenlee
Counties, Galiuro and Pinaleno Mountains in Graham county, and
Catalina and Rincon Mountains in eastern Pima county.
* WHEN...From 8 PM this evening to 5 PM MST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be difficult, especially Friday night into
Saturday morning which is expected to be the time period with the
most accumulation.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A wet Pacific storm system moving through the
region will keep snow levels elevated above 9000 feet early this
evening, then lowering to near 6,500 feet Saturday morning. Given
the wet nature of this system, confidence is low on the presence of
impactful heavy snowfall below 8000 feet.</description>
