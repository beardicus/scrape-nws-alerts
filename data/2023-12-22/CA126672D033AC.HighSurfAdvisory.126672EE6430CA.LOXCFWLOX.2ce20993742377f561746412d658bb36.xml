<headline>High Surf Advisory issued December 22 at 1:15PM PST until December 24 at 11:00AM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM SATURDAY TO
11 AM PST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Large breaking waves of 8 to 12 with dangerous rip
currents. Abnormally high tides around 7.0 to 7.2 feet are
expected.
* WHERE...San Luis Obispo County Beaches and Santa Barbara
County Central Coast Beaches.
* WHEN...From 3 AM Saturday to 11 AM PST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...There is an increased risk for ocean drowning. Rip
currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Large
breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and
rocks, and capsize small boats near shore. Pooling of sea
water is possible around high tide at beach and harbor areas
that is uncommon with normal tidal ranges. Enhanced beach
erosion is also possible. No significant damage is expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...High tides will occur each morning between
630 am and 800 am. There will likely be a break in the high surf
Sunday afternoon into Monday morning, but surf will build again
later Monday. Very large surf is expected Wednesday Night
through Friday.</description>
<instruction>Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
