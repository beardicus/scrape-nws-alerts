<description>...STRONG WINDS, RAIN AND SNOW THROUGH EASTERN TURNAGAIN ARM...
A strong front moving into the Prince William Sound tonight will
bring strong winds, rain, and some heavy snow to the Eastern
Turnagain Arm. Expect gusts between 35 and 50 mph at road level
overnight and into Saturday morning before letting up to 15 to 25
mph through Sunday morning. Snow levels will rise through the
night, resulting in rain falling on snow covered roadways. Expect
slushy and icy conditions to develop. The Girdwood valley will be
slower to transition to rain, but similar slushy and icy
conditions will develop. An additional low pressure system moving
towards the Kenai Peninsula Saturday evening will bring a period
of heavy rain to sea level locations. Ponding on roadways and
hydroplaning are possible due to heavy rain and snowmelt near sea
level. Snow accumulations through Sunday at sea level range from
5 to 10 inches, and are highly dependent on the transition to
rain.</description>
