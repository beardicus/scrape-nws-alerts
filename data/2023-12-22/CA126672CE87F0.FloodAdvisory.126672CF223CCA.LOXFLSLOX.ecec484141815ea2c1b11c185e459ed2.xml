<headline>Flood Advisory issued December 22 at 2:20AM PST until December 22 at 6:15AM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 345 AM PST EARLY THIS
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by heavy rainfall continues.
* WHERE...A portion of southwest California, including the following
counties, southern and central Los Angeles County and eastern
Ventura County.
* WHEN...Until 345 AM PST.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of low-lying and poor drainage areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 208 AM PST, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated widespread moderate to heavy rain across the
advisory area. Rainfall rates of 0.20 to 0.40 inches per hour
were common with local rates up to 0.50 inches per hour.
There is a slight chance of thunderstorms with briefly higher
rates.
Between 2 and 4 inches of rain have already fallen in much of
this area, with local totals over 5 inches. This has caused
widespread ponding of water on area roadways with flooding of
low-lying areas.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 0.5 inches to 1 inch are
expected.
This will result in widespread ponding of water on area
roadways and flooding of low-lying areas and intersections.
There may be rises and flooding of creeks and streams. Rocks
and boulders may fall onto roadways, especially below steep
terrain.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Long Beach, Thousand Oaks, Malibu, Acton, Burbank, Pasadena,
Glendale, Torrance, Universal City, North Hollywood,
Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Van Nuys, Downtown Los Angeles,
Encino, Culver City, Santa Monica, Woodland Hills and
Northridge.

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.</instruction>
