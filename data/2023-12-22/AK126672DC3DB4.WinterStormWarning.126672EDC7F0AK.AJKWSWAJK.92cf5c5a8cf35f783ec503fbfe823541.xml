<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued December 22 at 3:05PM AKST until December 24 at 6:00AM AKST by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...FRONT WILL BRING HEAVY SNOW TO THE HIGHWAYS...
.Area of surface low pressure will track north towards south-
central Alaska. The associated front will swing south to north
over the panhandle. Cold air ahead of the front will bring snow to
the northern Lynn Canal area. As warmer air slides north, snow
switching to rain is likely by Saturday afternoon for Haines and
Skagway. Farther up the highways near the border, moderate to
heavy snow will last into Saturday night.
...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM SATURDAY TO 6 AM AKST
SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 6 to 20
inches along the highways. Lighter amounts in Haines and
Skagway. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...Municipality of Skagway and Haines Borough and Klukwan,
including the Haines and Klondike Highways.
* WHEN...From 6 AM Saturday to 6 AM AKST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be difficult and is discouraged unless it
is an emergency.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Because of the switch from snow to rain,
the city of Haines can expect snowfall amounts around 3 to 5
inches. Skagway can expect snowfall amounts around 1 to 3
inches. If the southerly push of warmer air arrives later than
expected, the transition of snow to rain will be delayed,
resulting in greater snowfall amounts for the cities and areas
closer to sea level.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water
with you in case of an emergency.
People are urged to prepare their property before the onset of
winter weather.
