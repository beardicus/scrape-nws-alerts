<description>...LONG DURATION HEAVY SNOW EVENT FOR THE HIGHWAYS...
.A gale force low will move into the Gulf of Alaska Monday. The

preciptiation. The northerly winds in Northern Lynn Canal are
expected to keep the cooler air in place, so when the precip

over a 24 hour period.

NOON AKST TUESDAY...

12 inches.

* WHEN...From noon Monday to noon AKST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be very difficult and is discouraged
unless it is an emergency.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow will begin Monday morning. For
Haines and the Haines Highway, heavy snow is expected Monday
afternoon with snowfall rates near 1 inch per hour. Snowfall
rates will lighten Monday evening before heavier snow moves
back in Monday night into Tuesday morning. For the Klondike
Highway, moderate snowfall is expected Monday afternoon with
heavy snow moving in late Monday night into Tuesday morning.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water
with you in case of an emergency.
People are urged to prepare their property before the onset of
winter weather.
Heavy wet snow will be difficult to manage due to high water
content.
