<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH WEDNESDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...An extended period of sustained wave action is expected
as a series of fronts moves through the region along with
multiple moderate swell trains. Breaking waves of 15 to 20 ft
will coincide with higher than normal ocean levels, leading to
an increased risk of beach erosion. Additionally, there is a
minor risk of sneaker waves as these swell trains build into the
waters. Beginning Tuesday afternoon through Wednesday morning,
an even larger long period swell will allow for breaking waves
of 20 to 30 ft to arrive at the coast with a moderate risk of
sneaker waves.
* WHERE...The beaches of Douglas, Coos and Curry Counties.
* WHEN...Through Wednesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Beaches will be hazardous places to be through the
middle of next week. Jetties and rocks are not safe places to
stand, and you will risk death if you are caught by waves on
them. Beach erosion is possible. Sneaker waves can run up
significantly farther on beaches than normal, including over
rocks and jetties. These waves can suddenly knock people off of
their feet and quickly pull them into the cold ocean waters,
resulting in serious injury or death. Waves may also lift
driftwood logs, trapping anyone caught underneath.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Confidence is low regarding the sneaker
threat due to wind wave interference likely limiting, but not
completely negating the risk.
