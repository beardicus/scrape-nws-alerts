<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued December 03 at 11:32PM EST until December 04 at 1:00PM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM EST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow. Total snow accumulations of 4 to 8 inches.
* WHERE...Interior Waldo, Kennebec, and Androscoggin Counties.
* WHEN...Until 1 PM EST Monday.
* IMPACTS...A snowstorm will bring plowable snow to the region with
a period of moderate travel impacts expected. Periods of moderate
snow and low visibility will be the biggest hazards. The potential
exists for snowbands that will bring periods of locally heavy
snowfall, which will lead to rapid snow accumulations and
extremely dangerous travel conditions. Heavy wet snow will cause
weighted tree limbs, leading to snapped branches. Isolated to
scattered outages possible. Difficult travel conditions are
possible due to icy road conditions. Periods of moderate and heavy
snow will combine with low visibility to create dangerous driving
conditions. The hazardous conditions could impact the Monday
morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The timing of the heaviest snowfall around
the Monday morning commute has prompted this warning to be issued.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road conditions can
be obtained by going to newengland511.org
Persons should delay all travel if possible. If travel is absolutely
necessary, drive with extreme caution and be prepared for sudden
changes in visibility. Leave plenty of room between you and the
motorist ahead of you, and allow extra time to reach your
destination. Avoid sudden braking or acceleration, and be especially
cautious on hills or when making turns. Make sure your car is
winterized and in good working order.</instruction>
