<headline>Red Flag Warning issued August 24 at 2:39AM PDT until August 25 at 8:00AM PDT by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...Abundant lightning on dry fuels is anticipated this afternoon
into early Friday morning...
.An upper level wave will move into the region from the south this
afternoon and overnight. Thunderstorms are anticipated to pop up
across the region with the most impactful activity expected west
of the I-5 corridor. This area missed out on the beneficial
rainfall from Hurricane Hilary remnants and the threat for new
fire ignitions is highest in this area. Thunderstorm activity is
also anticipated east of the Cascades, but given recent rainfall
in this area, the threat of lightning ignited fires should be
diminished.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 5 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO
8 AM PDT FRIDAY FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE
WEATHER ZONE 280...
* IMPACTS...A higher threat of lightning ignited wild fires. Any
fires that develop have a high probability of spreading rapidly.
Abundant lightning can also ignite new fires and strain fire
fighting resources.
* AFFECTED AREA...The western section of FWZ 280. This includes
some fires within the Happy Camp Complex.
* THUNDERSTORMS...Isolated to scattered high based storms that are
likely to be mostly dry or have little precipitation. Lightning
strikes outside of precipitation cores are likely and cause for
concern.
* OUTFLOW WINDS...Gusts up to 45 mph
* DETAILED URL...View the hazard area in detail at
