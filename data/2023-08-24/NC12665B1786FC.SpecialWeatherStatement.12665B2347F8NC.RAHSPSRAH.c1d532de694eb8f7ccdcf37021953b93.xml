HAZARD...Winds in excess of 40 mph, pea size hail, and torrential
rainfall.

unsecured objects. Heavy rainfall may lead to localized

locations.

Lake Jeanette Marina, Oak Hollow Marina, Lake Brandt and Forest Oaks.

<instruction>Torrential rainfall is also occurring with this storm and may lead to

Very heavy rain can be expected due to the slow movement of this

roadways, standing water in low lying areas, and minor flooding of
creeks and streams. Drivers are urged to slow down and use extra
caution to avoid hydroplaning.</instruction>
