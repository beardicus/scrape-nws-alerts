<headline>Red Flag Warning issued August 24 at 1:19PM PDT until August 25 at 11:00AM PDT by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...Abundant lightning on dry fuels is anticipated this afternoon
into early Friday morning...
.An upper level wave will move into the region from the south
this afternoon and overnight. Thunderstorms are anticipated to
pop up across the region with the most impactful activity
expected west of the I-5 corridor. This area missed out on the
beneficial rainfall from Hurricane Hilary remnants and the threat
for new fire ignitions is highest in this area. Thunderstorm
activity is also anticipated east of the Cascades, but given
recent rainfall in this area, the threat of lightning ignited
fires should be diminished.
...RED FLAG WARNING NOW IN EFFECT FROM 5 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO
11 AM PDT FRIDAY FOR ABUNDANT LIGHTNING ON DRY FUELS FOR FIRE
WEATHER ZONE 620...
* IMPACTS...A higher threat of lightning ignited wild fires. Any
fires that develop have a higher probability of spreading
rapidly. Abundant lightning can also ignite new fires and
strain fire fighting resources.
* AFFECTED AREA...FWZ 620 within Josephine County.
* THUNDERSTORMS...Isolated to scattered high based storms that are
likely to be mostly dry or have little precipitation. Lightning
strikes outside of precipitation cores are possible and cause
for concern.
* OUTFLOW WINDS...Gusts up to 35 mph.
* DETAILED URL...View the hazard area in detail at

your evacuation plan. Collect essentials you don`t want to lose
and prioritize your checklist. Visit ready.gov/kit for more
