<headline>High Surf Advisory issued August 24 at 10:05AM AKDT until August 25 at 10:00AM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO 10 AM
AKDT FRIDAY...
The National Weather Service in Anchorage has issued a High Surf
Advisory, which is in effect from 4 PM this afternoon to 10 AM
AKDT Friday.
* LOCATION...South and West facing shores along Kuskokwim Bay.
* WAVES AND SURF...Water levels are expected to rise during high
tides, 2 to 5 feet above normal highest tide.
* TIMING...Until 10 AM AKDT Friday morning. Locations from Kipnuk
west can experience two tidal peaks above normal highest tide,
the first Friday evening and the second early Friday morning.
* IMPACTS...South to southwesterly gale force winds with gusts of
45 to 55 mph from a strong storm system moving northeast from
St. George Island to Toksook Bay. The resulting higher seas and
surf, coinciding with high tide, will raise the potential for
rough surf and coastal erosion for south and west facing
communities along Kuskokwim Bay.</description>
<instruction>A high surf advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in
the advisory area, producing rip currents and localized beach
erosion.</instruction>
