        <headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued October 12 at 8:21PM EDT until October 13 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City NC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, 2 to 4 feet of inundation
above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of
10 to 15 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards
Statement, dangerous rip currents, large breaking waves
expected, and strong longshore currents in the surf zone.

* WHERE...Northern Outer Banks.

* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, until 5 PM EDT Monday.
For the High Surf Advisory, until 1 AM EDT Tuesday. For the
Beach Hazards Statement, from 7 AM EDT Monday through Monday
evening.

* IMPACTS...Up to 2 to 4 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in some areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in a significant threat to life and property. Severe
flooding will extend inland from the waterfront causing flooding
of many homes and businesses with some structural damage
possible. In some areas, battering waves will cause additional
damage to property. Numerous roads will be impassable under
several feet of water and vehicles will be submerged. Dangerous
swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw a swimmer or
surfer head first into the bottom causing neck and back
injuries.
</description>
        <instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.

Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.

Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.

Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.

Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
