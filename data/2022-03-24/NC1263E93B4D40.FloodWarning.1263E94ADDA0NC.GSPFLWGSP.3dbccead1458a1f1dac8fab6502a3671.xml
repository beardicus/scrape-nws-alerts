<description>...The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg SC has
issued a Flood Warning for the following rivers in North Carolina...
French Broad River At Blantyre affecting Transylvania and
Henderson Counties.
.Periods of moderate to heavy rain over the past 24 hours has
resulted in storm-total accumulations of 3-5 inches, with isolated
totals approaching 6 inches, across the upper French Broad River
watershed.  This heavy rainfall has caused significant rises along
the upper French Broad River, from Rosman, to Brevard, Blantyre,
Horse Shoe, Fletcher, and Avery Creek.  The upper French Broad river
is expected to exceed Minor Flood Stage near Blantyre and
Action/Advisory Stage at Fletcher, causing nuisance to Minor
flooding of adjacent low-lying, flood-prone areas including
farmland, woodlands, parks, greenways, boat-access areas, and a few
secondary roads and driveways.  The French Broad River is expected
to remain out of its banks into Thursday night, with conditions
improving by Friday morning.

inundate farmland between the French Broad River and the railroad
tracks. Floodwaters may start to inundate the shoulders of River

to impact boat access areas at Grove Bridge Rd. and Crab Creek Rd.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 11:46 PM EDT Wednesday the stage was 15.4 feet and rising
