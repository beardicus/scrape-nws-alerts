* WHAT...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to Mud Creek
near Hendersonville.
* WHERE...Central Henderson County, North Carolina
* WHEN...Until 100 PM EDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding along Mud Creek near Hendersonville.

secondary roads.
* On Mud Creek, between 6 and 8 feet: Farmland and other low-lying
areas up and downstream from Erkwood Dr are flooding.  Backwater
effects along Wash Creek may be causing floodwaters to approach
the access road to the shopping plaza just south of Gateway Park
at the intersection of S Church St and S Main St.  E Caswell St
may be flooded from storm culvert backwater effects underneath the
railroad tracks adjacent to Mud Creek.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 657 AM EDT, No additional rainfall is expected for about
another week.  However, periods of moderate to heavy rain on
Wednesday resulted in 2-4 inches of storm-total rainfall
across Henderson County, with localized totals exceeding 5
inches within the headwaters of Mud Creek. This caused
excessive runoff and significant stream rises across much of
Henderson County, but especially within the Mud Creek
watershed.  Small streams have fully receded across Henderson
County, but high flows continue along Mud Creek this morning.
Mud Creek crested at 9.74 feet at 12:45am and is now falling
steadily.  Mud Creek is currently at 8.12 feet and will
continue to fall towards the Action/Advisory Stage of 6.5
feet by this afternoon.  The Flood Advisory for nuisance
flooding will remain in effect until the stream falls below
Action/Advisory Stage.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Hendersonville, Flat Rock, Mountain Home, Laurel Park, Valley
Hill and Crab Creek.</description>
