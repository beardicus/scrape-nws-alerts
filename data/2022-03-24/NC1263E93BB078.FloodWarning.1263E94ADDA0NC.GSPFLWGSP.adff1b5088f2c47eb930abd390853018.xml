<headline>Flood Warning issued March 24 at 2:54AM EDT until March 25 at 2:00AM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 AM EDT THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Heavy rain has ended, but Minor flooding caused by
excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...Central and southern Henderson County, North Carolina.
* WHEN...Until 700 AM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor Flooding along Mud Creek and high flows along the
Green River are ongoing. Nuisance to Minor flooding along the
Green River is possible.
* At 9.5 feet, Minor Flooding continues on Mud Creek.  Mud Creek
reaches the bottom of the bridge deck at the S Grove St bridge.
Mud Creek reaches the bottom of the bridge beams at the Erkwood Rd
bridge.  Backwater effects along Wash Creek may be inundating much
of the access road to the shopping plaza just south of Gateway
Park at the intersection of S Church St and S Main St.
Floodwaters may be spilling into the plaza parking lot.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 245 AM EDT, Heavy rain has ended, but periods of moderate
to heavy rain over the past 24 hours has resulted in 2-4
inches of storm-total rainfall across Henderson County, with
localized totals exceeding 5 inches within the headwaters of
Mud Creek and the Green River. This caused excessive runoff
and significant stream rises across much of Henderson County,
but especially within the Mud Creek and Green River
watersheds.  Minor flooding is ongoing, primarily along Mud
Creek near Hendersonville, but area streams have crested;
therefore, flood conditions will gradually improve into the
morning hours.  The Flood Warning will remain in effect until
streams recede back below critical levels.
Minor flooding is defined as flooding of parks, greenways,
farmland, nurseries, woodlands, and low-water crossings up to
2-4 feet deep as well as inundation of secondary roads and
campgrounds up to 1-2 feet deep.
Mud Creek is above the Minor Flood Stage of 8.5 feet at 9.6
feet and falling.  Mud Creek crested at 9.74 feet at 1245am.
Expect Mud Creek to fall below Minor Flood Stage later this
morning and below the Action/Advisory Stage of 6.5 feet by
this afternoon.
- Some locations that may continue to experience flooding
include...
Hendersonville, Flat Rock, Mountain Home, Laurel Park, Valley
Hill, East Flat Rock, Tuxedo and Crab Creek.</description>
