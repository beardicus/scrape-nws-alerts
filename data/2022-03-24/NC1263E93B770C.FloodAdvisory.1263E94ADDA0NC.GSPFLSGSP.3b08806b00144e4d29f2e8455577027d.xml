<headline>Flood Advisory issued March 24 at 1:07AM EDT until March 25 at 2:00AM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 1245 PM EDT THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Southern Caldwell and northeast Burke counties in North
Carolina.
* WHEN...Until 1245 PM EDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas
including farmland, nurseries, woodlands, low-water crossings, and
boat-access areas is expected.  Nuisance flooding is defined as
less than 2` inundation of farmland, nurseries, woodlands. parks,
greenways, boat-access area, and low-water crossings and less than
1` inundation of secondary roads.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1257 AM EDT, Although rainfall has ended across Burke and
Caldwell counties, periods of moderate to heavy rain over the
past 12 hours resulted in storm-total accumulations of 2-4
inches across the area.  This caused within-bank rises on
most streams across Burke and Caldwell counties; however,
high flows within the Wilson Creek, Mulberry Creek, and Johns
River headwaters caused earlier nuisance flooding near
Collettsville and Old Johns River Rd and the small floodwave
is now traveling downstream of Collettsville into Burke
County and the Chesterfield community.  This will cause
nuisance flooding along the Johns River from the Adako
community to the NC 18/US 64 boat-access area.
Johns River at Corpening Bridge Rd is currently at 7.46 feet
and is rising rapidly.  Johns River is expected to exceed
Action/Advisory Stage of 8.5 feet over the next 1-2 hours
with a crest near 10 feet possible into the early morning
hours.  A reasonable worst-case crest of 11 feet is possible.
Between 9.0 and 10.0 feet:  Playmore Beach Rd, Johns River
Rd, and other low-water crossings along Johns River begin  to
flood.
Between 10.5 and 11.5 feet: The boat-access area and parking
lot at NC 18/US 64 begins to flood.
Additionally, high flows along tributaries feeding Lake
Rhodhiss is causing a rapid pool rise.  The pool at Lake
Rhodhiss is at 100.4 feet and may continue to rise past 101.0
feet overnight tonight and early this morning.  Nuisance
flooding along the lake shoreline including of docks and some
residential yards is possible if the lake exceeds 101.0 feet.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Morganton, Longview, Sawmills, Granite Falls, Valdese,
Drexel, Connelly Springs, Rutherford College, Rhodhiss, Lake
Rhodhiss, Lake Hickory, Collettsville and Northlakes.</description>
