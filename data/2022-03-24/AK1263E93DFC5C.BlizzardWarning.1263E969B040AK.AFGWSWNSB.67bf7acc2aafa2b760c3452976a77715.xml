NIGHT...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions occurring. Travel will be very
difficult to impossible.
* WHERE...Eastern Beaufort Sea Coast.
* WHEN...Until midnight Saturday night.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Condition will improve for a short time
this evening with blizzard conditions returning as the winds
increase tonight. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph will cause
whiteout conditions in blowing snow. Significant drifting of the
snow is likely. Cold wind chills as low as 50 below zero will
cause frostbite in as little as 10 minutes to exposed skin.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
A Blizzard Warning means severe winter weather conditions are
expected or occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds
and poor visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout
conditions, making travel extremely difficult. The latest road
conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</description>
