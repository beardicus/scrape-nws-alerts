<headline>Flood Warning issued March 24 at 12:27AM EDT until March 27 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 345 AM EDT EARLY THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...A portion of western North Carolina, including the
following county, Transylvania.
* WHEN...Until 345 AM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance to Minor flooding is ongoing across central and
eastern Transylvania County.  Minor flooding is defined as
flooding of parks, greenways, farmland, nurseries, woodlands, and
low-water crossings up to 2-4 feet deep as well as inundation of
secondary roads and campgrounds up to 1-2 feet deep.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1208 AM EDT, Heavy rain has ended across Transylvania
County.  However, periods of moderate to heavy rain over the
past 24 hours resulted in storm-total accumulations of 3-5
inches, with isolated totals reaching 6 inches across the
county.  This has caused significant rises on area streams,
including the upper French Broad River, Davidson River, and
Little River and associated tributaries.  While smaller
streams have crested and are receding below bankfull levels,
larger mainstem streams, including the Little River and
French Broad River, are still rising.  This will cause
nuisance to Minor flooding of adjacent low-lying areas
downstream of Rosman to Brevard to Etowah along the French
Broad River, nuisance flooding along the Davidson River near
Pisgah Forest, and nuisance to Minor flooding around Penrose
and Crab Creek along the Little River.  Flooding is expected
to persist into early Thursday morning, especially along the
Little River near Penrose, therefore the Flood Warning will
be extended.
The French Broad River near Rosman has crested below the
Action/Advisory Stage of 7.0 feet, peaking at 6.1 feet at
10pm.  The river will continue to fall tonight.
The Davidson River near Pisgah Forest crested at the
Action/Advisory Stage of 4.5 feet at 10pm.  The river will
continue to fall slowly over the next few hours then fall
more rapidly into early Thursday morning.
The Little River near Penrose is at 9.64 feet and rising.
Action/Advisory Stage is 7.5 feet.  Minor Flood Stage is 10.0
feet.  Little River is expected to continue to rise steadily
for the next several hours and will likely crest below 10.5
feet overnight tonight into early Thursday morning.  A
reasonable worst case crest of 11 feet is possible.
At 10.0 feet: Minor Flood Stage. Farmland on either side of
the Little River near Cascade Lake Rd and Merrill Ln is
experiencing up to 24&quot; of inundation. Cascade Lake Rd and
Merrill Ln are experiencing inundation up to 12-18&quot; deep.
Many ditches and small streams in the vicinity will likely be
flooding.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Brevard, Rosman, Looking Glass, Dupont State Forest,
Connestee, Penrose, Little River In Transylvania County,
Balsam Grove, North Transylvania and Cedar Mountain.
