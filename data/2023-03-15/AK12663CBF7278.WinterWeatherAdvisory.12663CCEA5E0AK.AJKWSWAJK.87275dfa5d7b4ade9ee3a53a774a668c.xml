<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued March 15 at 6:38AM AKDT until March 16 at 6:00AM AKDT by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...Snow Followed by Heavy Rain for Southeast Alaska...
.Snow arrives to the central and northern Panhandle late Tuesday
night through Thursday. Confidence is increasing that the far
northern Panhandle, including Haines and Skagway, will see heavy
snow while warming temperatures change snow over to rain for the
Icy Strait Corridor. Precipitation is still expected to start as
snow along the Icy Strait Corridor, but a general 2 to 4 inches
is expected as a change to rain should limit any significant
accumulations. As for Yakutat, the main plume of moisture is
expected to develop to the east limiting snow accumulations. That
being said, by Thursday evening, the main plume of moisture is
expected to shift to west, increasing the possibility for Yakutat
to see significant snow accumulations. Yakutat`s snow
accumulations will be extremely dependent on where the plume of
moisture develops so this trend will be monitored closely
throughout this event.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM AKDT
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Snow followed by heavy rain. Total snow accumulations
of 2 to 5 inches.
* WHERE...City and Borough of Juneau.
* WHEN...From 4 AM Wednesday to 6 AM AKDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous conditions could impact the morning or
evening commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow is expected to change to rain by
Wednesday night with warming temperatures. Heavy rain on
existing snow pack and icy roads will make very slick
conditions and travel difficult. Ponding of water in culverts,
roadways, driveways, and yards is likely.</description>
