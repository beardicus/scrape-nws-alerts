<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued March 15 at 3:15PM AKDT until March 16 at 11:00PM AKDT by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...Snow Followed by Heavy Rain for Southeast Alaska...
.Snow continues to fall over the central and northern Panhandle
through late Thursday. Heavy snow over the far northern
Panhandle will last thought Thursday night, especially at higher
elevations and locations along the border. Timing of the warming
temperatures and the switch from snow over to rain for the Icy
Strait Corridor is less certain and has been delayed. 2 to 5
inches of snow is still expected over the Icy Strait Corridor but
possibly more with the delayed change to rain. For Yakutat
moderate snow accumulations through Thursday evening before the
main plume of moisture is expected to shift to west with
significant snow accumulations expected through Friday morning.
Still some uncertainty on where the plume of moisture tracks so
this event will be monitored closely.
...WINTER STORM WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM AKDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow followed by heavy rain expected. Total snow
accumulations of 7 to 14 inches at sea level with up to 25
inches at higher elevations. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Municipality of Skagway and Haines Borough and Klukwan.
* WHEN...Until 11 PM AKDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel on the Klondike Highway will be difficult.

late Thursday morning with heavy snow continuing at higher
elevations through Thursday night.</description>
