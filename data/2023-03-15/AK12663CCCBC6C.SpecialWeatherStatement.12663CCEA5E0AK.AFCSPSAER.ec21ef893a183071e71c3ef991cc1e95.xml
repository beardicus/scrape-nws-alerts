<description>...BANDS OF MODERATE TO HEAVY SNOW SHOWERS TO CONTINUE ACROSS
COASTAL SOUTHCENTRAL ALASKA THROUGH THURSDAY...
A complex area of low pressure in the western Gulf of Alaska will
continue to push bands of snow showers north from the Gulf of
Alaska across the Southcentral coast. The first of these bands has
already moved from eastern Prince William Sound to Portage Valley,
with several inches of snow for locations from Cordova to Portage
and Wittier. A second round of snow showers is expected to move
through the region this evening and a third expected for early
Thursday morning.
These snow showers may be heavy at times with snowfall rates of
up to one and half inches of snow per hour. Visibilities within
heavier snow showers may also fall to as low as one quarter mile
at times. For locations where these heavier snow showers persist,
several additional inches of snow are possible. These bands of
snow showers are expected to diminish in intensity and taper off
from east to west across Prince William Sound and the eastern
Kenai Peninsula through the day Thursday.
Motorists are urged to slow down and use caution.</description>
