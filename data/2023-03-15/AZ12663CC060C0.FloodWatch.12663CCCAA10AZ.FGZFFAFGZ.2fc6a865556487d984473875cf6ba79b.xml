<headline>Flood Watch issued March 15 at 1:48PM MST until March 15 at 6:00PM MST by NWS Flagstaff</headline>
<description>.Heavy rainfall on a deep primed snowpack has caused increased snow
melt and runoff. Flows in several rivers, creeks, and streams have
already increased to near or above action or flood stage with
additional water rises to critical levels possible.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt continues this
afternoon through Thursday.
* WHERE...Portions of central Arizona, including the lower
elevations of Yavapai County and northern Gila County.
* WHEN...Through 5 PM MST Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Flash flooding will be possible in creeks, normally dry
washes, and swimming holes. Low-water crossings could experience
flooding, which would create deadly travel conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Widespread heavy rainfall is occurring and expected to
continue into Thursday morning along and south of the
Mogollon Rim. Rain and snowmelt have combined to create
enhanced runoff and significant flows in area waterways.

additional rises possible.
