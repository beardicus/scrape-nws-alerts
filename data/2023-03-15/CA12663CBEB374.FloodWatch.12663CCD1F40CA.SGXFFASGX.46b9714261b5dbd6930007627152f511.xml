<headline>Flood Watch issued March 15 at 2:49AM PDT until March 15 at 9:00PM PDT by NWS SanDiego</headline>
<description>.Heavy rain may fall on a deep primed snowpack leading to the melt
increasing. Flows in rivers may increase quickly and reach critical
levels.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 PM PDT THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of Southwest California, including the following
areas, Orange County Coastal Areas, Orange County Inland Areas,
San Bernardino and Riverside County Valleys-The Inland Empire and
Santa Ana Mountains and Foothills.
* WHEN...Until 2 PM PDT this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water
crossings may be flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A Pacific storm system with moisture from an Atmospheric
River will spread widespread moderate to heavy rainfall
across the area past sunrise. This rain falling on already
saturated soils will likely produce rapid runoff, resulting
in local flooding.
