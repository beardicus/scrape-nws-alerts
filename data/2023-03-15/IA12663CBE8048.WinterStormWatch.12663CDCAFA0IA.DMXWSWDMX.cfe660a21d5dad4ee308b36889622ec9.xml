<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued March 15 at 3:18AM CDT until March 17 at 1:00AM CDT by NWS DesMoines</headline>
<description>...Rain changing to windswept snow Thursday into Thursday
night...
.A winter storm will track through the region on Thursday with
travel impacts likely over northwest and north central Iowa and
areas in neighboring states. While the precipitation will start as
rain Thursday morning, a cold front will push through Iowa during
the day that will rapidly increase winds and deliver colder air.
This will cause the rain to quickly change to snow from northwest
Iowa southeastward through the day. Windswept snow will lead to
significantly reduced visibilities over northwest into portions
of north central Iowa and may approach blizzard conditions. While
much of the snow will end Thursday evening, winds will remain
strong and gusty from the northwest overnight into Friday with
blowing snow remaining a concern for travelers.
...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY MORNING THROUGH
LATE THURSDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation possible. Total snow
accumulations of 2 to 4 inches. Wind gusts over 45 mph and as
high as 55 mph.
* WHERE...Northwest Iowa into parts of North Central Iowa.
* WHEN...From Thursday morning through late Thursday night.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility, including the
Thursday evening commute, and may approach blizzard conditions.
Gusty winds could bring down tree branches.</description>
