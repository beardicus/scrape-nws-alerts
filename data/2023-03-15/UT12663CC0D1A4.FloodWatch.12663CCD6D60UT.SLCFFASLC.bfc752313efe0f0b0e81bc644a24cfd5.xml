<headline>Flood Watch issued March 15 at 5:37PM MDT until March 16 at 12:00AM MDT by NWS Saltlake</headline>
<description>.Moderate to heavy rain will fall on a deep, primed snowpack in the
headwaters of the Virgin River, Paria, Kanab Creek, and Buckskin,
leading to increased snow melt and runoff. Flows on all area
streams, rivers and slot canyons will be high and will continue to
produce areas of flooding.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...High flows on all area streams, rivers, and slot canyons
across southwest Utah caused by rain and snowmelt will continue.
* WHERE...A portion of Utah, including the following areas, South
Central Utah, Lower Washington County and Zion National Park.
* WHEN...Through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff is resulting in some flooding of
rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone
locations and additional flooding remains possible. Additional
creeks and streams may rise out of their banks and additional
flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Area creeks
and streams are running high and could flood with more heavy rain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Heavy rain combined with snowmelt.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible
additional Flood Warnings. Those with outdoor recreation plans
across southern Utah that include slot canyons or travel in or near
normally dry washes, streams, and rivers should consider postponing
until runoff recedes.</instruction>
