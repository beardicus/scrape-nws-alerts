<description>...SNOW FOLLOWED BY HEAVY RAIN FOR SOUTHEAST ALASKA...
.Snow continues to fall over the central and northern Panhandle
this evening. Heavy snow over the far northern Panhandle will
last through tonight and well into Thursday, especially at higher
elevations and along the Klondike and Haines Highways.
For those along the Icy Strait corridor, timing of the warming
temperatures and the switch from snow to rain is expected to
happen late Wednesday night into early Thursday morning.
For Yakutat, the main plume of moisture will shift to the west
with significant snow accumulations expected Friday afternoon
into Friday night. There is still some uncertainty on where the
heaviest plume of moisture will track.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM AKDT
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Snow. Additional snow accumulations of up to 5 inches,
highest snow accumulations expected in Mendenhall Valley. Winds
gusting as high as 40 mph.

* WHEN...Until 6 AM AKDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow is expected to change to rain by
Thursday morning with warming temperatures. Heavy rain on

roadways, driveways, and yards is likely.</description>
