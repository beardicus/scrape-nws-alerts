<description>...Snow Followed by Heavy Rain for Southeast Alaska...
.Snow continues to fall over the central and northern Panhandle
through Thursday. Higher confidence that the far northern
Panhandle, including Haines and Skagway, will see heavy snow.
Timing of the warming temperatures and the change snow over to
rain for the Icy Strait Corridor is less certain with a delayed
change. 2 to 5 inches of snow is still expected over the Icy
Strait Corridor but possibly more with the delayed change to
rain. For Yakutat by Thursday evening the main plume of moisture
is expected to shift to west, increasing the possibility for
Yakutat to see significant snow accumulations. Yakutat`s snow
accumulations will be extremely dependent on where the plume of
moisture develops so this trend will be monitored closely
throughout this event.
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY EVENING
THROUGH FRIDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 5 to 9
inches possible. Winds could gust as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...City and Borough of Yakutat.
* WHEN...From Thursday evening through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Heaviest snow rates possible late
Thursday night.</description>
