* WHEN...For the Excessive Heat Warning, from 10 AM Friday to 10

* IMPACTS...Gusty winds and reduced visibility from blowing dust
will make driving difficult. Gusty winds could blow around
unsecured objects. Tree limbs could be blown down and a few
power outages may result. Extreme heat will significantly
increase the potential for heat related illnesses,
particularly for those working or participating in outdoor
activities.</description>
<instruction>Use extra caution when driving, especially if operating a high
profile vehicle. Secure outdoor objects.
Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
