<description>...FLOOD WATCH NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY EVENING...
The Flood Watch is now in effect for
* a portion of South Florida, including the following areas,
Coastal Broward, Coastal Miami-Dade, Metro Broward, and Metro
Miami-Dade.
* Through Thursday evening
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Storm drains
and ditches may become clogged with debris. Extensive street
flooding and flooding of creeks and rivers are possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Recent rainfall accumulations of 1 to 3 inches with isolated
amounts up to 5 inches have fallen over the metro areas since
early Tuesday on top of the 8 to 15 inches over last weekend
have led to saturated ground across coastal and metro Miami-
Dade and Broward Counties. Additional excessive rainfall
possible through Thursday could lead to additional flooding.

<instruction>A Flood Watch means there is a potential for flooding based on
current forecasts.
You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible
Flood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be
prepared to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
