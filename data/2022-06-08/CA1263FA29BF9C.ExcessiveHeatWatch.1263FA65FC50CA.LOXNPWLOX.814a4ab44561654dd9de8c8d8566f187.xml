* WHERE...Los Angeles County Mountains.
* WHEN...For the Wind Advisory, from 3 PM this afternoon to 9 AM

* IMPACTS...Gusty winds will blow around unsecured objects and

Tree limbs could be blown down and a few power outages may

<instruction>Use extra caution when driving, especially if operating a high

situation. Be prepared to drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-
conditioned room, stay out of the sun, and check up on relatives
and neighbors.
Young children and pets should never be left unattended in
vehicles under any circumstances. This is especially true during
warm or hot weather when car interiors can reach lethal
temperatures in a matter of minutes.</instruction>
