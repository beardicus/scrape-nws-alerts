<headline>Flood Warning issued June 08 at 5:39PM CDT until June 16 at 10:00AM CDT by NWS Duluth</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM CDT TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt continues. Namakan and
Rainy Lake have both surpassed levels set during the 2014 peak
levels with Rainy Lake now above the 1950 record peak as well.
* WHERE...Portions of north central Minnesota and northeast
Minnesota, including the following counties, in north central
Minnesota, Koochiching. In northeast Minnesota, St. Louis.
* WHEN...Until further notice.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring. Several
structures are flooded and some sand bagging operations are
continuing. Low-water crossings are inundated with water and may
not be passable. Expect many areas of slow moving or standing
water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 502 PM CDT, emergency management reported ongoing
extensive flooding.
- The dry weather over most of the past week has meant
declining flows in the smaller streams and reduced inflows to
the lakes. The 4-day forecast is mostly dry, and the
expectation is
for the recent inflow trend to continue. There is some rain
in the forecast beyond four days, but amounts remain
uncertain. Flows across most of the watershed are expected to
remain very high for the week ahead.
Namakan and Kabetogama Lakes were at 1122.4 feet as of June
8, which is 22 inches above the peak level set in 2014 and 6
inches below the 1916 peak. The level of Namakan Lake is
expected to fall by 7 to 11 inches between June 8 and June
15.
Rainy Lake was at 1113.2 feet as of June 8 which is 22 inches
above the 2014 flooding peak and 3 inches above the previous
record
peak of 1950. Rainy Lake is expected to rise by 1 to 2 inches
between June 8 and June 15. A peak is unlikely before mid-
June on Rainy Lake regardless of precipitation patterns.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
International Falls, Kabetogama, Crane Lake, Kabetogama Lake,
Voyageurs National Park, Rainy Lake East, Rainy Lake West,
northwestern Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, Ranier,
Ray, Island View, Ericksburg, Johnson Lake and Sand Point
Lake.

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Once levels have peaked, it will take a matter of weeks to a month
for levels to decline to near normal summer levels. Additional
rainfall will prolong the time it takes for levels to recede.</instruction>
