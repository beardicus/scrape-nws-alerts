<description>...WIND ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM PDT THURSDAY...
...EXCESSIVE HEAT WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY MORNING
THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Wind Advisory, west winds 20 to 30 mph with
gusts up to 50 mph expected. For the Excessive Heat Watch,
dangerously hot conditions with temperatures up to 95 possible.
* WHERE...Los Angeles County Mountains.
* WHEN...For the Wind Advisory, until 9 AM PDT Thursday. For the
Excessive Heat Watch, from Friday morning through Saturday
evening.
* IMPACTS...Gusty winds will blow around unsecured objects and
make driving difficult, especially for high profile vehicles.
Tree limbs could be blown down and a few power outages may
result. Extreme heat will significantly increase the potential
for heat related illnesses, particularly for those working or
participating in outdoor activities.</description>
<instruction>Use extra caution when driving, especially if operating a high
profile vehicle. Secure outdoor objects.
Monitor the latest forecasts and warnings for updates on this
situation. Be prepared to drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-
conditioned room, stay out of the sun, and check up on relatives
and neighbors.
Young children and pets should never be left unattended in
vehicles under any circumstances. This is especially true during
warm or hot weather when car interiors can reach lethal
temperatures in a matter of minutes.</instruction>
