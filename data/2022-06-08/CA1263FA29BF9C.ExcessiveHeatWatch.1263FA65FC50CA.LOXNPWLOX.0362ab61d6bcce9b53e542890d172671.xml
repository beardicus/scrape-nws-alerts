<headline>Excessive Heat Watch issued June 08 at 3:23AM PDT until June 11 at 10:00PM PDT by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...WIND ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 3 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO 3 AM PDT
THURSDAY...
...EXCESSIVE HEAT WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY MORNING
THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Wind Advisory, west winds 15 to 25 mph with
gusts up to 45 mph expected. For the Excessive Heat Watch,
dangerously hot conditions with temperatures up to 105
possible.
* WHERE...Antelope Valley.
* WHEN...For the Wind Advisory, from 3 PM this afternoon to 3 AM
PDT Thursday. For the Excessive Heat Watch, from Friday
morning through Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...Gusty winds and reduced visibility from blowing dust
will make driving difficult. Gusty winds could blow around
unsecured objects. Tree limbs could be blown down and a few
power outages may result. Extreme heat will significantly
increase the potential for heat related illnesses, particularly
for those working or participating in outdoor activities.</description>
<instruction>Use extra caution when driving, especially if operating a high
profile vehicle. Secure outdoor objects.
Monitor the latest forecasts and warnings for updates on this
situation. Be prepared to drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-
conditioned room, stay out of the sun, and check up on relatives
and neighbors.
Young children and pets should never be left unattended in
vehicles under any circumstances. This is especially true during
warm or hot weather when car interiors can reach lethal
temperatures in a matter of minutes.</instruction>
