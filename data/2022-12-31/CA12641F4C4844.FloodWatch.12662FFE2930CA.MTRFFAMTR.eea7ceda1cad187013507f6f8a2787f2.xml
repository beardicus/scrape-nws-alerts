<senderName>NWS Monterey (The San Francisco area)</senderName>
<headline>Flood Watch issued December 31 at 4:25AM PST until January 01 at 7:00AM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>.Rain intensities are starting to increase across North Bay this
morning, with moderate to heavy rain possible. This moderate to
heavy rain will spread south and east through the morning hours.
Heaviest rain is expected during the cold frontal passage.
Therefore, increased runoff will result in rapid rises and flooding
of area rivers, streams, and creeks.  High tide in the San Francisco
Bay Saturday morning will coincide with the heaviest rain which
could result in coastal flooding along the Bay shorelines in
low-lying/flood prone areas. Area burn scars are also under threat
as well.

possible.

Clara Valley Including San Jose and Santa Cruz Mountains. In
western California, San Francisco.
* WHEN...Through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
