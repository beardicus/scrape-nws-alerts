<headline>Flood Warning issued December 31 at 6:40PM PST until further notice by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 945 PM PST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of northern California, including the following
counties, San Mateo and Santa Clara.
* WHEN...Until 945 PM PST.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring. Numerous roads
remain closed due to flooding. Streams continue to rise due to
excess runoff from earlier rainfall. Low-water crossings are
inundated with water and may not be passable. Expect many areas of
slow moving or standing water. It will take several hours for all
the water from these storms to work through local drainage systems
in urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 640 PM PST, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated heavy rain. Flooding is ongoing or expected to
begin shortly in the warned area. Between 2 and 6 inches of
rain have fallen.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 0.2 to 1 inch are possible in
the warned area.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
San Mateo, Redwood City, Palo Alto, Burlingame, San Carlos,
Belmont, Half Moon Bay, Hillsborough, Woodside, Highlands-
Baywood Park, El Granada, Portola Valley, Emerald Lake Hills
and Highlands.

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.</instruction>
