<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 31 at 10:35PM AKST until January 01 at 9:00AM AKST by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...Winter Weather Advisories Continue for Dyea as well as along the
Haines and Klondike Highways...
...Little to no additional snow is expected for the cities of
Haines and Skagway overnight...
A warm front continues moving northward up Lynn Canal tonight and
has resulted in temperatures near sea level near Lynn Canal
warming to above the freezing mark. This has resulted in the
precipitation type for Haines and Skagway to begin changing to
rain. Further inland, away from the water, and at higher
elevations, cold temperatures still persist for Dyea, the
Klondike Highway, and out the road along the Haines Highway.
Additional snowfall for the upper parts of the highways will
continue through the early morning before diminishing.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM AKST
SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 3 to 5
inches.
* WHERE...Dyea, and the Klondike Highway.
* WHEN...Through 9 AM AKST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on reduced visibility and slippery road
conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Heaviest snowfall rates are expected after
midnight near the border. Near Dyea, a wintry mix is expected to
transition to all rain overnight as the warmer air continues to
move into the area. Near Skagway and Lynn Canal, a wintry mix
has already changed over to all rain.</description>
