* WHERE...Southeastern Imperial County and Imperial Valley.
* WHEN...For the Dense Fog Advisory, until 10 AM PST this

<instruction>A Wind Advisory means that sustained wind speeds of between
30 and 40 mph are expected, or wind gusts of between 40 and
58 mph. Winds this strong can make driving difficult, especially
for high profile vehicles. In addition, strong winds over desert
areas could result in briefly lowered visibilities to well under
a mile at times in blowing dust or blowing sand. Use extra
caution.
If driving, slow down, use your headlights, and leave plenty of
distance ahead of you.</instruction>
