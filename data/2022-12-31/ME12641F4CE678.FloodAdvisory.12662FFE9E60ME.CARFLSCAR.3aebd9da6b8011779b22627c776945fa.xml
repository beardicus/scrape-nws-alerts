* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam continues.
* WHERE...A portion of East Central Maine, including the following
county, Penobscot.
* WHEN...Until 100 PM EST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying areas. Water over roadways.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1126 AM EST, Howland Fire Department and Emergency
Management reported a 2 to 3 mile long ice jam on the
Penobscot River above the Howland Dam. This is causing
flooding near Merrill Brook Lane and Gardner Lane in Howland
cutting off access to residents. Water continues to rise on
Gordon Brook near Mattamiscontis Road, leading to minor
flooding near Mattamiscontis Road. Both Gardner Lane and
Mattamiscontis Roads are closed due to flood waters. Water
behind the ice jam will continue to slowly rise with runoff
and upstream snow melt.
- Residents near Merrill Brook that are located on Merrill
Brook Lane and Gardner Lane, and along Mattamiscontis Road
near Gordon Brook are the most likely place to experience
minor flooding.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Howland, Mattamiscontis Township, Enfield, and Chester.
- Flood safety can be found at www.weather.gov/safety/flood</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.
Water levels can rise and fall quickly in the vicinity of ice jams.
Those with interests along rivers and tributary streams should be
alert for rapidly fluctuating water levels in the vicinity of ice
jams. Never drive through flooded roads or around closed road
barricades. The barricades are there for your safety due to the
potential for ice jam releases or continued flooding.</instruction>
