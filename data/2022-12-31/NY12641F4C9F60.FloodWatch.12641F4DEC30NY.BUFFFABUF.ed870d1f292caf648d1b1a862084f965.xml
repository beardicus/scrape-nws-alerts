<headline>Flood Watch issued December 31 at 9:48AM EST until December 31 at 6:00PM EST by NWS Buffalo</headline>
<description>.The potential for ice jams on Buffalo area creeks will decrease
today as relatively thin, slushy ice is flushed downstream. Rain
today and tonight will contribute to increased runoff in addition to
ongoing snowmelt and bring another increase in flows late today
through Sunday on the Buffalo area creeks. Minor poor drainage
flooding is also possible in urban areas where piles of snow are
blocking drainage structures this weekend.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is possible from ice jams along the Buffalo
area creeks through today, but ice jam potential is decreasing as
ice is flushed downstream. Minor flooding is also possible later
today through Sunday morning on the Buffalo area creeks due to
increased runoff from snowmelt and rainfall. Minor flooding is
possible in urban areas this weekend where piles of snow are
blocking drainage structures.
* WHERE...Erie County.
* WHEN...Through Sunday morning.
* IMPACTS...Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding
may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
