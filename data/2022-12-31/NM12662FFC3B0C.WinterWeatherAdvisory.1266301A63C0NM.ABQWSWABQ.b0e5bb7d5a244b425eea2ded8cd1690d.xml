<description>...A WINTER STORM WILL BRING SIGNIFICANT MOUNTAIN SNOW TO WESTERN
AND NORTHERN NEW MEXICO SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...
.A vigorous low pressure system will approach New Mexico Sunday
morning and pass over the state Sunday night into Monday. Areas most
likely to observe significant snow will be the high elevations above
8,000 to 9,000 feet in western and northern New Mexico where 6 to 12
inches of fresh snow accumulations are possible. Areas of reduced
visibility and snow-packed mountain roads are possible during this

reducing visibility. Snow levels will fall Sunday evening when the
heaviest snow is expected. Periods of light to occasionally moderate
snow may continue through the day Monday.

PM MST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations between 6 and
12 inches possible above 8,000 feet. Winds could gust as high as
35 mph, creating areas of blowing snow and reduced visibility.
* WHERE...Jemez Mountains, Tusas Mountains Including Chama, and
Southwest Mountains.
* WHEN...From 8 AM Sunday to 5 PM MST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Tire traction will be
reduced. Consider making alternate travel plans or delaying travel.</description>
