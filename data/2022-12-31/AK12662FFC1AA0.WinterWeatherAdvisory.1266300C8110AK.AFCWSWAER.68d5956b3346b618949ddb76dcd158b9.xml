<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT
TONIGHT TO MIDNIGHT AKST SUNDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow accumulations of
up to 1 inch and ice accumulations of a glaze up to two tenths
of an inch. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph along Cook Inlet.
* WHERE...Western Kenai Peninsula.
* WHEN...From midnight Saturday night to midnight AKST Sunday
night.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be hazardous. Areas of blowing snow
along Cook Inlet could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Light precipitation is expected to develop
this evening through the overnight hours. Periods of
precipitation will then persist through at least Sunday evening.
When precipitation first arrives it will start mainly as snow,
expect for rain in the Homer area and other areas near sea level
along Kachemak Bay. Snow and blowing snow along the Sterling
Highway from Anchor Point to Kenai could lead to low
visibilities. As warmer air moves in aloft Saturday night into
Sunday morning, precipitation will transition to freezing rain.
Some areas will warm above freezing on Sunday, especially inland
toward Cooper Landing. Areas near the Inlet will likely hover
right near the freezing mark.</description>
