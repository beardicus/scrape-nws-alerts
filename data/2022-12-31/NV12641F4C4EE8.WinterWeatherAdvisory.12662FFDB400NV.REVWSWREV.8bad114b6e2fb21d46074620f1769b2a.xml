<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 31 at 4:42AM PST until January 01 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 4 PM THIS AFTERNOON TO
4 AM PST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 2 to 6 inches
above 5000 feet, with a dusting up to 2 inches for valley
floors. Higher elevation summits, such as Sweetwater could see 6
to 12 inches of new snow. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Mineral and Southern Lyon Counties.
* WHEN...From 4 PM this afternoon to 4 AM PST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Gusty winds could
bring down tree branches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow levels will be falling through the
afternoon and evening. There is a large boom/bust potential for
snow totals in the 5000-6000 foot elevation range dependent on
how fast snow levels come down. Any remnant moisture on roadways
may freeze overnight with slick and icy roads through New Year`s
morning.</description>
<instruction>Even light snowfall causes major travel delays, especially during
periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to
reach your destination. Leave extra space between vehicles since
it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
