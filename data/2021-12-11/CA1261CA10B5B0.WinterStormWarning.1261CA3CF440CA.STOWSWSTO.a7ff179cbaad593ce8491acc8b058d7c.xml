<description>...Dangerous Winter Storm to Produce Very Heavy Snow with Strong
Winds and Whiteout Conditions...
.A strong winter storm will bring very heavy snow to the
mountains of northern California. Snow will first arrive to
northwestern Shasta County this afternoon including portions of
I-5 north of Redding, spreading southeast into the southern
Cascades and northern Sierra tonight and Sunday morning. Snow
levels will gradually lower over time through late Monday and
Tuesday. Expect tremendous snow accumulations at pass levels with
yardsticks required for snow measurement. This will results in
significant travel delays with extremely difficult to impossible
travel over the mountains. Strong winds will further reduce
visibilities during this event with whiteout conditions.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM PST
TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow with near-zero visibilities, making travel
difficult to impossible. Damage to trees and power lines is
possible. Snow accumulation 8 to 36 inches. Localized amounts
up to 4 to 6 feet possible above 4000 ft.
* WHERE...Shasta Lake Area / Northern Shasta County and Mountains
Southwestern Shasta County to Western Colusa County including
Interstate 5 north of Redding and portions of Highway 299.
* WHEN...4 PM Saturday to 4 AM Tuesday.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Be prepared for significant reductions in
visibility at times with white-out conditions. Snow levels
will drop to 2000 ft by early Tuesday, possibly lower.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
A Winter Storm Warning for snow means there will be snow covered
roads and limited visibilities. Travel is not recommended while
the warning is in effect. If you must travel, keep an extra
flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case of an
emergency.The latest road conditions for the state you are
calling from can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</description>
