<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 11 at 1:16PM PST until December 13 at 10:00PM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...HEAVY SNOWFALL EXPECTED THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...
A series of wet and cold low pressure systems will move across
Northern California and Southern Oregon today through Tuesday,
likely resulting in heavy snowfall across much of Northern
California in Siskiyou County, the Siskiyou Mountains, and the
Oregon Cascades. There is high confidence that feet of snow will
fall at elevations above 3500 feet across those areas, and even
at lower elevations in the Mount Shasta City area. Significant
travel problems are likely to result throughout the weekend and
into early next week.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Snow with total snow accumulations of 4 to 6 inches
through Sunday morning. Another round of snow accumulations of 6
to 10 inches is expected Sunday night into Monday. Winds
gusting as high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...In California, Northeast Siskiyou and Northwest Modoc
Counties and Modoc County. In Oregon, Klamath Basin and
Central and Eastern Lake County. This includes highways 97,
395, 140 and 139 in addition to the cities of Klamath Falls
and Lakeview.
* WHEN...Until 10 PM PST Monday. There will be a relative lull in
activity during the day Sunday, but snow will continue into
Monday evening. The strongest winds are expected this afternoon
and evening and again early Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be difficult. Patchy blowing snow could
significantly reduce visibility. Gusty winds could bring down
tree branches.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The bulk of the snow will fall tonight into
Sunday morning and again Sunday night into Monday.
