<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued December 11 at 4:20PM AKST until December 14 at 12:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY MORNING THROUGH
MONDAY EVENING MAINLY FROM DILLINGHAM NORTH AND WEST...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions possible. Total snow accumulations of
1 to 5 inches possible. Northeast winds 20 to 25 mph with gusts
as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...Mainly from Dillingham north and west.
* WHEN...From Monday morning through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility to as low as one
quarter mile. Arctic air temperatures combined with the wind
will cause wind chills to be as low as 35 degrees below zero
which could frostbite in as little as 10 to 15 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow is anticipated to overspread the
northern Bristol Bay Coast late Monday morning peaking sometime
in the afternoon with gradually improving conditions through
the late evening hours. There remains uncertainty as to exactly
how far inland the precipitation advances. Therefore, this watch
is just for the Northern Bristol Bay coast higher elevations
north and west of Dillingham at this time.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Watch for blizzard conditions means there is a
potential for falling and/or blowing snow with strong winds and
extremely poor visibilities. This can lead to whiteout conditions
and make travel very hazardous.</instruction>
