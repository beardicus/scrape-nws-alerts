<description>...HEAVY SNOWFALL EXPECTED THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...
A series of wet and cold low pressure systems will move across
Northern California and Southern Oregon tonight through Tuesday,
likely resulting in heavy snowfall across much of Northern
California in Siskiyou County, the Siskiyou Mountains, and the
Oregon Cascades. There is high confidence that feet of snow will
fall at elevations above 3500 feet across those areas, and even at
lower elevations in the Mount Shasta City area. Significant
travel problems are likely to result throughout the weekend and
into early next week.

expected Sunday night into Monday morning. Winds gusting as
high as 40 mph over exposed terrain.
* WHERE...Eastern Douglas County Foothills above 3500 feet.
* WHEN...Until 10 PM PST Monday. There will be a relative lull in
activity during the day Sunday, but snow will continue into
Monday evening. The strongest winds are expected Saturday
