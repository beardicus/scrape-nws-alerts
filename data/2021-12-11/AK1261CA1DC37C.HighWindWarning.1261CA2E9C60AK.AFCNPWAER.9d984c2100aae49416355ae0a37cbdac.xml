<headline>High Wind Warning issued December 11 at 10:59PM AKST until December 13 at 9:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM AKST MONDAY
THROUGH THOMPSON PASS...
* WHAT...Northeast winds 30 to 50 mph with gusts up to 75 mph
expected.
* WHERE...Thompson Pass.
* WHEN...Until 9 AM AKST Monday.
* IMPACTS...High winds may move loose debris, damage property,
and cause power outages. Travel will be difficult, especially
for high profile vehicles. The combination of very cold
temperatures and strong winds will likely drive wind chills
down to 40 below zero during the day Sunday persisting through
most of Monday. Strong winds could transport snow and abruptly
reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Winds will steadily increase through
Sunday morning. While warning level gusts are not expected for
the town of Valdez at this time, gusts to 55 mph will be
possible. No new snowfall is expected with this system, but
any transportable snow could easily be blown around. Be
prepared for sudden reductions to visibility less than one
half mile through the pass.</description>
<instruction>Wind chills of 40 below zero will cause frostbite on exposed skin
in as little as 10 minutes.
People are urged to secure loose objects that could be blown
around or damaged by the wind. Prepare for the possibility of
widespread power outages. Use caution if you must drive.</instruction>
