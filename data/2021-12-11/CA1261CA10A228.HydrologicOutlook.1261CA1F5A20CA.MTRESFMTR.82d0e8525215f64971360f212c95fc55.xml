<description>...A MODERATELY STRONG FRONTAL SYSTEM AND ACCOMPANYING
ATMOSPHERIC RIVER WILL BRING WIDESPREAD RAINFALL TO THE REGION
lATE SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY...
* WHAT... A moderately strong frontal system with a tap of very
moist air is expected to bring light rain to the region starting
late Saturday night with periods of moderate to heavy rain
possible Sunday through Monday evening. Showers will linger
through Tuesday. Heavy rain will lead to rapid rises of area
rivers, streams, and creeks. Flooding may result if the system
stalls over an area for a prolonged period of time, as models
currently project, or due to blocked culverts, drainages, and
storm drains. However, as with all ARs, where, when, or if they
stall is difficult to pin down. This system will result in an
increased risk of mudslides and debris flow over wildfire burn
areas, as well as localized ponding of water in low-lying or
poorly drained areas. 1 to 3 inches of rain is forecast for most
urban and lower elevation areas, potentially less in rain
shadowed valleys. 3 to 6 inches of rain is projected over the
coastal ranges and elevated terrain. Locally up to 10 inches are
possible over favored peaks and higher terrain.
* WHERE... Entire forecast area from Napa and Sonoma counties
south through Monterey and San Benito counties. Latest model
guidance suggests the coastal slopes of the Santa Cruz Mountains
and Santa Lucia Mountains above Big Sur will most likely
received the greatest accumulation of precipitation.
* WHEN... Late Saturday night through Tuesday. Light rain will
begin late Saturday night over the North Bay with periods of
moderate to heavy rain spreading south across the Bay Area
Sunday and Monday. Showers will linger through Tuesday.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS... The primary concern is for mud, rock, and
debris flows that may occur across recent burn areas. In
addition, strong gusty winds are likely at times, especially on
Sunday night through Monday evening. Debris from gusty winds may
cause drainage blockages which could create a localized flooding
threat, especially in mountainous terrain. Localized ponding of
water is likely in low-lying or poorly drained areas, such as
freeway offramps. No mainstem river flooding is forecast due to
the relatively dry conditions so far this winter. However,
rapid rises of rivers and streams is very likely. Roadways will
be extra slick and roadway ponding is likely. Please monitor the
latest forecast for the most up to date weather information.
Confidence is high that we will receive widespread rainfall from
this system. However, confidence is low to moderate with
respect to the timing and location of heaviest precipitation, as
well as total rainfall accumulation.</description>
