<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued December 11 at 4:20PM AKST until December 13 at 9:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY MORNING THROUGH
MONDAY EVENING ALONG THE KUSKOKWIM DELTA COAST...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions possible. Total snow accumulations of
1 to 3 inches possible. East winds 20 to 25 mph with gusts as
high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...Along the Kuskokwim Delta Coast.
* WHEN...From Monday morning through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility to as low as one
quarter mile at times. Arctic air temperatures combined with
the wind will cause wind chills to be as low as 35 degrees below
zero which could frostbite in as little as 10 to 15 minutes.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow is anticipated to overspread the
Kuskokwim Delta Coast Monday morning peaking sometime in the
afternoon with gradually improving conditions through the
evening hours. There remains uncertainty as to exactly how far
inland the precipitation advances. Therefore, this watch is
just for the Kuskokwim Delta Coast at this time.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Watch for blizzard conditions means there is a
potential for falling and/or blowing snow with strong winds and
extremely poor visibilities. This can lead to whiteout conditions
and make travel very hazardous.</instruction>
