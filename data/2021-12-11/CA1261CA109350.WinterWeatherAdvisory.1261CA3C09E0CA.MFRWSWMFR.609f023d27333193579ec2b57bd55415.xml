<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued December 11 at 1:16PM PST until December 13 at 10:00PM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...HEAVY SNOWFALL EXPECTED THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...
A series of wet and cold low pressure systems will move across
Northern California and Southern Oregon today through Tuesday,
likely resulting in heavy snowfall across much of Northern
California in Siskiyou County, the Siskiyou Mountains, and the
Oregon Cascades. There is high confidence that feet of snow will
fall at elevations above 3500 feet across those areas, and even
at lower elevations in the Mount Shasta City area. Significant
travel problems are likely to result throughout the weekend and
into early next week.
