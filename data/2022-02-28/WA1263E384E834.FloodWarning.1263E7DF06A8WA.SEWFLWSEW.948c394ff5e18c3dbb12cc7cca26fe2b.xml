<headline>Flood Warning issued February 28 at 12:05PM PST until March 01 at 1:54PM PST by NWS Seattle</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Seattle WA has issued a Flood
Warning for the following rivers in Washington...
Puyallup River Near Orting affecting Pierce County.
Nisqually River Near National affecting Lewis and Pierce Counties.
Cowlitz River At Randle affecting Lewis County.
.A strong storm is coming in to western Washington with multiple
factors that will produce high runoff and flooding. Heavy, prolonged
rainfall will be coupled with some snow snow melt in low to mid
elevations of the mountains from rising snow levels and strong warm
and moist winds. This will drive some rivers above minor to major
flooding.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM THIS EVENING TO EARLY TOMORROW
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Puyallup River Near Orting.
* WHEN...From this evening to early tomorrow afternoon.
* IMPACTS...At 10000.0 cfs, the Puyallup river will flood low lying
areas near Orting and along the upper reaches, including along
Orville Road East south of Brooks Road, Neadham Road, and the
vicinity of the County Subdivision/Tomolla Farm. High flows will
also increase the threat of channel migration and bank erosion.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 11:15 AM PST Monday the flow was 4720.0 cfs.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above flood stage
this evening to a crest of 12630 cfs late this evening. It
will then fall below flood stage late tonight.
- Flood flow is 10000.0 cfs.
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
12200.0 cfs on 01/29/1965.

<instruction>Caution is urged when walking near riverbanks.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. Most flood related deaths
occur in automobiles. Do not attempt to cross water covered bridges,
dips, or low water crossings. Never try to cross a flowing stream,
even a small one, on foot. To escape rising water find another route
over higher ground.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
The next statement will be issued by this evening at 800 PM PST.</instruction>
