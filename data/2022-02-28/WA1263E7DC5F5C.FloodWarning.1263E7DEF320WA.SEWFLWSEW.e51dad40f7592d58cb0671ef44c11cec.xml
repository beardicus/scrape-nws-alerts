<headline>Flood Warning issued February 28 at 8:15PM PST until March 01 at 1:04PM PST by NWS Seattle</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Seattle WA has issued a Flood
Warning for the following rivers in Washington...
Deschutes River Near Rainier affecting Thurston County.
.A strong storm is impacting western Washington with multiple
factors that is producing high runoff and flooding. Heavy, prolonged
rainfall will be coupled with some snow snow melt in low to mid
elevations of the mountains from rising snow levels and strong warm
and moist winds. This will drive the Deschutes River to minor
flood stage. Heavy rain will also threaten landslides and debris
flows.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL EARLY TOMORROW AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Deschutes River Near Rainier.
* WHEN...Until early tomorrow afternoon.
* IMPACTS...At 11.0 feet, the Deschutes River will flood downstream
in Tumwater Valley including the golf course.  Minor flooding will
also occur in several residential areas...mainly Cougar Mountain
and Driftwood Valley. Many roads and farm lands will also be
flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 7:45 PM PST Monday the stage was 10.4 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above flood stage
late this evening to a crest of just over 11.0 feet tonight.
It will then fall below flood stage late tonight.
- Flood stage is 11.0 feet.
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
10.9 feet on 01/14/1988.
