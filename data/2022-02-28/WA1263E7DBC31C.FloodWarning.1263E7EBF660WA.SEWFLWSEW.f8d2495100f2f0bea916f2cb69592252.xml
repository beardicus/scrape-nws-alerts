<description>...The National Weather Service in Seattle WA has issued a Flood
Warning for the following rivers in Washington...
South Prairie Creek at South Prairie affecting Pierce County.
.A strong storm is coming in to western Washington with multiple
factors that will produce high runoff and flooding. Heavy, prolonged
rainfall will be coupled with some snow snow melt in low to mid
elevations of the mountains from rising snow levels and strong warm
and moist winds. This will drive South Prairie Creek above minor
flood stage. Heavy rain will also threaten landslides and debris
flows.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM THIS EVENING TO LATE TOMORROW
EVENING...

* WHERE...South Prairie Creek at South Prairie.
* WHEN...From this evening to late tomorrow evening.
* IMPACTS...At 4000.0 cfs, South Prairie Creek will flood low lying
areas and roads from the Town of South Prairie downstream to the
Carbon River near Orting.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 2:45 PM PST Monday the flow was 2750.0 cfs.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above flood stage
this evening to a crest of 5070 cfs late tonight. It will
then fall below flood stage early tomorrow afternoon.
- Flood flow is 4000.0 cfs.
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
5060.0 cfs on 10/31/2015.

<instruction>Caution is urged when walking near riverbanks.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. Most flood related deaths
occur in automobiles. Do not attempt to cross water covered bridges,
dips, or low water crossings. Never try to cross a flowing stream,
even a small one, on foot. To escape rising water find another route
over higher ground.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
The next statement will be issued by late tonight at 1215 AM PST.</instruction>
