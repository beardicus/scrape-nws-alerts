elevations of the mountains from rising snow levels and strong warm
and moist winds. This will drive some rivers above minor to major
flooding.

tributaries...and other streams within and near the Cowlitz River
Basin.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 11:45 AM PST Monday the stage was 7.4 feet.

Flooding is occurring or is imminent. Most flood related deaths
occur in automobiles. Do not attempt to cross water covered bridges,
dips, or low water crossings. Never try to cross a flowing stream,
even a small one, on foot. To escape rising water find another route
over higher ground.
