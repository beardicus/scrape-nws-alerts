<headline>Flood Warning issued February 28 at 5:40PM PST until March 02 at 8:07AM PST by NWS Seattle</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Seattle WA has issued a Flood
Warning for the following rivers in Washington...
White River At R Street Bridge affecting King and Pierce Counties.
.A strong storm is impacting western Washington with multiple
factors that will produce high runoff and flooding. Heavy, prolonged
rainfall will be coupled with some snow snow melt in low to mid
elevations of the mountains from rising snow levels and strong warm
and moist winds. River rises on the White River below Mud Mountain
Dam will combine with water coming out of the dam to rise to minor
flood stage. Heavy rain will also threaten landslides and debris
flows.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM THIS EVENING TO WEDNESDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...White River At R Street Bridge.
* WHEN...From this evening to Wednesday morning.
* IMPACTS...At 7500.0 feet, River flooding is likely to occur near
low bank areas around and downstream of the Stewart Streat Bridge
in the city of Sumner.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 4:45 PM PST Monday the flow was 7200.0 cfs.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise to near flood stage
this evening and will fluctuate near flood stage through
Wednesday. It`s highest point may be tomorrow morning at
around 7800 cfs, but will depend on reservoir operation
changes and the local flows. It will then fall below flood
stage for good and continue to fall Wednesday night.
- Flood flow is 7500.0 cfs.
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
6400.0 cfs on 02/18/2020.

<instruction>Motorists should not attempt to drive around barricades or drive
cars through flooded areas.
Caution is urged when walking near riverbanks.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. Most flood related deaths
occur in automobiles. Do not attempt to cross water covered bridges,
dips, or low water crossings. Never try to cross a flowing stream,
even a small one, on foot. To escape rising water find another route
over higher ground.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
The next statement will be issued by late tonight at 130 AM PST.</instruction>
