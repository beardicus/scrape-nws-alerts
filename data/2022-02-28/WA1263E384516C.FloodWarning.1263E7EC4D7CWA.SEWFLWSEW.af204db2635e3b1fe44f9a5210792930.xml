<description>...The National Weather Service in Seattle WA has issued a Flood
Warning for the following rivers in Washington...
Tolt River Above Carnation affecting King County.
Snoqualmie River Near Snoqualmie Falls affecting King County.
Snoqualmie River Near Carnation affecting King County.
.A strong storm is coming in to western Washington with multiple
factors that will produce high runoff and flooding. Heavy, prolonged
rainfall will be coupled with some snow snow melt in low to mid
elevations of the mountains from rising snow levels and strong warm
and moist winds. This will drive some rivers above minor to major
flooding.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM THIS AFTERNOON TO EARLY WEDNESDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Major flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Snoqualmie River Near Snoqualmie Falls.
* WHEN...From this afternoon to early Wednesday morning.
* IMPACTS...At 41000.0 cfs, the Snoqualmie River will cause major
flooding from the town of Snoqualmie downstream through Fall
City...inundating most of the farm land in the flood plain...some
residential areas...and many roads. Flood waters will be deep and
swift in some areas. Flooding will occur all along the river
including headwaters...tributaries...and other streams within and
near the Snoqualmie River Basin. This river level on the
Snoqualmie corresponds roughly to a phase 4 flood in the King
County flood system.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 6:30 AM PST Monday the flow was 6270.0 cfs.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above flood stage
this afternoon to a crest of 43250 cfs late this evening. It
will then fall below flood stage tomorrow afternoon.
- Flood flow is 20000.0 cfs.
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
