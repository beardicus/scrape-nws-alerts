<headline>Flood Warning issued February 28 at 1:38PM PST until March 02 at 2:35AM PST by NWS Seattle</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Seattle WA has issued a Flood
Warning for the following rivers in Washington...
Chehalis River Above Doty affecting Lewis County.
Newaukum River Near Chehalis affecting Lewis County.
Chehalis River Above Grand Mound affecting Grays Harbor and
Thurston Counties.
.A strong storm is coming in to western Washington with multiple
factors that will produce high runoff and flooding. Heavy, prolonged
rainfall will be coupled with some snow snow melt in low to mid
elevations of the mountains from rising snow levels and strong warm
and moist winds. This will drive some rivers above minor to moderate
flooding. Other points in the Chehalis River Basin may yet rise
above flood stage as well.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT TO EARLY WEDNESDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Moderate flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Newaukum River Near Chehalis.
* WHEN...From late tonight to early Wednesday morning.
* IMPACTS...At 204.5 feet, deep and hazardous flood waters will
inundate many roads and residential and commercial areas along the
Newaukum River and its forks.  Impacted roadways and surrounding
areas include SR 508, Jackson Hwy. and Tune, Rush, Sommerville,
Griel, Hamilton, Tauscher, Guerrier, Kirkland, Macomber, Rice,
Senn, Lucas Creek, Middle Fork and North Fork, Bishop, Shorey,
Labree, Gish, Yates Roads.  A stage of 204.5 feet on the Newaukum
roughly corresponds to Phase 3 flood in the Lewis County flood
system.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 12:45 PM PST Monday the stage was 198.2 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above flood stage
just after midnight tonight to a crest of 204.7 feet late
tomorrow morning. It will then fall below flood stage
tomorrow afternoon.
- Flood stage is 202.5 feet.

<instruction>Caution is urged when walking near riverbanks.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. Most flood related deaths
occur in automobiles. Do not attempt to cross water covered bridges,
dips, or low water crossings. Never try to cross a flowing stream,
even a small one, on foot. To escape rising water find another route
over higher ground.
