<headline>Flood Warning issued February 28 at 1:38PM PST until March 01 at 2:04AM PST by NWS Seattle</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Seattle WA has issued a Flood
Warning for the following rivers in Washington...
Chehalis River Above Doty affecting Lewis County.
Newaukum River Near Chehalis affecting Lewis County.
Chehalis River Above Grand Mound affecting Grays Harbor and
Thurston Counties.
.A strong storm is coming in to western Washington with multiple
factors that will produce high runoff and flooding. Heavy, prolonged
rainfall will be coupled with some snow snow melt in low to mid
elevations of the mountains from rising snow levels and strong warm
and moist winds. This will drive some rivers above minor to moderate
flooding. Other points in the Chehalis River Basin may yet rise
above flood stage as well.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Chehalis River Above Doty.
* WHEN...Until just after midnight tonight.
* IMPACTS...At 318.0 feet, flood waters of the upper Chehalis and
South Fork Chehalis will inundate many roads and some residential
and commercial areas.  Impacted roadways and surrounding areas
include Curtis Hill...Lake Creek...Moon Hill...Wildwood Roads in
the Boisfort Valley and Labri Rd. and Front St. below Doty. This
stage roughly corresponds to just below Phase 2 in the Lewis
County flood system.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 12:30 PM PST Monday the stage was 316.5 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above flood stage
late this afternoon to a crest of 318.2 feet late this
afternoon. It will then fall below flood stage this evening.
- Flood stage is 318.0 feet.

<instruction>Caution is urged when walking near riverbanks.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. Most flood related deaths
occur in automobiles. Do not attempt to cross water covered bridges,
dips, or low water crossings. Never try to cross a flowing stream,
even a small one, on foot. To escape rising water find another route
over higher ground.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
The next statement will be issued by this evening at 945 PM PST.</instruction>
