<description>...Dense Fog Has Spread Across Western Okeechobee County...
At 545 AM, surface observations and satellite imagery showed dense
fog had spread from southwest Florida across the Kissimmee River
from Basinger to near Okeechobee and Fort Drum. Visibilities were
being reduced to between one quarter and one half mile across
this area. The fog will persist past sunrise, before burning off
by 9 AM.
Motorists, traveling on U.S. Highway 98, State Roads 70 and 78,
and possibly as far east as U.S. Highway 441 should prepare to
encounter reduced visibilities in dense fog this morning. When
driving in fog, reduce your speed, use your low beam headlights
only, and leave extra distance between your vehicle and the one in
front of you.</description>
