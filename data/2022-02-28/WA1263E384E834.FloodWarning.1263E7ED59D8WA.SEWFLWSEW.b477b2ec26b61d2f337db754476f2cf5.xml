Warning for the following rivers in Washington...
Puyallup River Near Orting affecting Pierce County.
Nisqually River Near National affecting Lewis and Pierce Counties.
Cowlitz River At Randle affecting Lewis County.
.A strong storm is coming in to western Washington with multiple
factors that will produce high runoff and flooding. Heavy, prolonged
rainfall will be coupled with some snow snow melt in low to mid
elevations of the mountains from rising snow levels and strong warm
and moist winds. This will drive some rivers above minor to major
flooding.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM THIS EVENING TO WEDNESDAY MORNING...

* WHERE...Nisqually River Near National.
* WHEN...From this evening to Wednesday morning.
* IMPACTS...At 10000.0 cfs, the Nisqually River will flood along the
upper reaches of the river from Mt Rainier National Park
downstream to Alder Lake. Swift waters will flood roads...pasture
lands...and farms. Erosion may damage the river banks.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 11:00 AM PST Monday the flow was 2580.0 cfs.
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above flood stage
this evening to a crest of 13620 cfs late tomorrow morning.
It will then fall below flood stage late tomorrow evening.
- Flood flow is 8000.0 cfs.
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
13400.0 cfs on 01/07/2009.

<instruction>Caution is urged when walking near riverbanks.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. Most flood related deaths
occur in automobiles. Do not attempt to cross water covered bridges,
dips, or low water crossings. Never try to cross a flowing stream,
even a small one, on foot. To escape rising water find another route
over higher ground.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
The next statement will be issued by this evening at 800 PM PST.</instruction>
