<headline>Flood Watch issued January 25 at 11:30AM EST  by NWS Baltimore/Washington</headline>
<description>.Heavy rain may fall on a deep primed snowpack leading to the melt
increasing. Flows in rivers may increase quickly and reach critical
levels.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rapid snowmelt and heavy rainfall is
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of western Maryland, including the following
areas, Extreme Western Allegany and Garrett and eastern West
Virginia, including the following areas, Western Grant, Western
Mineral and Western Pendleton.
* WHEN...Through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Low-water
crossings may be flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rising temperatures and humidity combined with incoming
rainfall will lead to rapid snowmelt over the watch area.
Snow water equivalent values of 2 to 4 inches have been
observed along and west of the Allegheny Front. These values
combined with 0.50 to 1.00 inches of rainfall through late
tonight will lead to flooding concerns. Frozen ground from
the recent cold snap and snowfall will also aid in additional
runoff to small streams and creeks, as well as main stem
rivers.

and preparedness information</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
