<headline>Flood Advisory issued January 25 at 4:46PM EST until January 27 at 1:01PM EST by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has issued
a Flood Advisory for the following rivers in North Carolina...
French Broad River At Blantyre affecting Transylvania and
Henderson Counties.
.Moderate rainfall over the upper French Broad River watershed has
resulted in 1-2 inches of accumulation since Thursday morning.
While significant rainfall has departed the area, excessive runoff
has caused significant stream rises on tributaries as well the upper
French Broad River, resulting in isolated areas of bankfull rises
and nuisance flooding of adjacent, low-lying areas.  The upper
French Broad River from Brevard to Penrose, Blantyre, and Etowah
will rise to near 16.0 feet by Friday morning before a slow
recession begins.  However, additional heavy rainfall is possible on
Saturday and given high streamflows and saturated soils, additional
rises on the French Broad River and associated tributaries are
likely.  Residents, business owners, and other interested parties
should stay weather aware and monitor the latest forecasts.  A River
Flood Warning may be issued for Minor flooding.
