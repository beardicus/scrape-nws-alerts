<description>...LONG DURATION HEAVY RAIN AND RISING FREEZING LEVELS THROUGH
MONDAY...
A warm front will cause precipitation to track into the region
from south to north on Friday. A wind shift out of the south with
increased speeds will allow warming temperatures through the
northern inner channels Friday evening. Meanwhile, snow/freezing
levels will steadily rise. Freezing levels over Juneau will rise
to around 3,000 feet Friday night, then on Sunday, these values
top out at over 4,000 feet.
Rainfall totals over this 4 day period will vary as two or more
surges of moisture move through, but are likely to reach 1-2 inches
each day. Greatest rainfall rates currently expected on Friday
night and Sunday, and Monday.
Rain on significant snowpack currently in place can result in
several impacts:
* Snow will become heavier as it absorbs the rain, making it
more difficult to move.
* Heavier snow may affect susceptible properties and vessels.
* Drainage blocked by snow will cause rainfall runoff and snowmelt
onto streets and ponding.
* Rain on hard-pack snow will become icy.
* Snowmelt from high elevation snow will add to runoff.
The City and Borough of Juneau asks residents to provide
assistance with clearing drains on or near their property to
reduce the risk of flooding. Residents are also asked to please
keep fire hydrants clear and shovel snow off their vessels in the
harbors.
Local avalanche forecasters with CBJ, DOT, and AEL&amp;P are
expecting an increased risk of avalanches in known avalanche
paths through this event. Please refer to those entities for more
information on the risk of avalanches or visit
juneau.org/avalanche.
Stay tuned to updates from the National Weather Service on this
developing pattern change.</description>
