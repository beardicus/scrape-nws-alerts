<headline>Flood Watch issued January 25 at 3:40AM CST until January 25 at 12:00PM CST by NWS Jackson</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON TODAY...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of southeast Arkansas, including the following
counties, Ashley and Chicot, northeast Louisiana, including the
following parishes, Catahoula, Concordia, East Carroll, Franklin
LA, Madison LA, Morehouse, Richland, Tensas and West Carroll, and
Mississippi, including the following counties, Bolivar, Humphreys,
Issaquena, Leflore, Sharkey, Sunflower and Washington.
* WHEN...Until noon today.
* IMPACTS...Flash flooding will likely occur in poor drainage and
urban areas. Extensive street flooding and flooding of creeks and
rivers are possible.  Localized more impactful flooding could
occur where the heaviest rain falls, including the potential for
road closures.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Showers and thunderstorms capable of producing heavy rain
will continue to move across the area through much of the
morning hours. The ground is soaked from recent heavy
rainfall, and this additional heavy rain will run off quickly
and potentially result in flash flooding.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action
should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.</instruction>
