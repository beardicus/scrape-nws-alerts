<headline>High Surf Advisory issued January 25 at 2:01AM PST until January 26 at 4:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM PST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Large breaking waves of 8 to 12 feet with dangerous rip
currents expected. Highest across west and northwest facing
beaches. Minor coastal flooding during morning high tides.
* WHERE...San Luis Obispo County Beaches and Santa Barbara
County Central Coast Beaches.
* WHEN...Until 4 PM PST Friday.
* IMPACTS...There is an increased risk for ocean drowning. Rip
currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Large
breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and
rocks, and capsize small boats near shore. Pooling of sea
water is expected around the time of high tide over sandy
beach areas including bike paths and walkways. Significant
damage is NOT expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...High tides will peak near 6.1 to 6.4 feet
each morning between 830 AM and 10 AM.</description>
<instruction>Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
