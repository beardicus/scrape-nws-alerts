<instruction>These forecasts are based on observed precipitation as well as
forecast precipitation 48 hours into the future. River rises are
being affected by snow melt from a combination of precipitation and
warm temperatures.
An ice jam is affecting water levels in this area. River forecasts
during ice jams are less certain due to many complicated factors.
Significant river ice cover can cause large water level fluctuations
and flooding with little advanced notice.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
The next statement will be issued late tonight at 400 AM CST.</instruction>
