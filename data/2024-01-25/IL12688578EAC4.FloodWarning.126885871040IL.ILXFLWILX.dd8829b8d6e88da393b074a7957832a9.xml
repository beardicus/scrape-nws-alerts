<headline>Flood Warning issued January 25 at 1:29PM CST until further notice by NWS Central Illinois</headline>
<description>...Forecast flooding changed from Minor to Moderate severity and
increased in duration for the following rivers in Illinois...
Sangamon River near Oakford affecting Menard, Cass and Mason
Counties.
.An ice jam remains in place along the Sangamon River near Oakford.
This is causing water to infiltrate the agricultural, wooded, and
grassy areas along the river. Rapid rises around and upstream of the
jam are possible with fluctuations of 1-5 feet. Incoming
precipitation may considerably add flow to the backed-up river reach
and/or contribute to ice movement and potentially a break up. Be
alert for rapid rises that can quickly filter downstream if ice does
break up.
