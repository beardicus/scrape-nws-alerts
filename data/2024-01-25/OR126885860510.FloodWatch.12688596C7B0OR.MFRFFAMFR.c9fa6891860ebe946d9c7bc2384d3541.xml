<headline>Flood Watch issued January 25 at 9:16PM PST  by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH NOW IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH SATURDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Curry County in southwestern Oregon, including
Brookings, Gold Beach, the US 101 corridor, and all area drainages.
* WHEN...From Friday afternoon through Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations,
and could also result in  rockfalls and landslides. Area creeks
and streams are running high and could rise out of their banks or
flood with more heavy rain. Flooding may occur in poor drainage
and urban areas. Low-water crossings may be flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Heavy and steady rainfall will begin Friday morning and
continue through Saturday evening. The heaviest rainfall is
expected from Friday afternoon into Saturday morning.
Excessive rainfall on already saturated soils, leading to
increased runoff into already high rivers, creeks, and
streams. Rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches are forecast over
a period of 42 hours.
