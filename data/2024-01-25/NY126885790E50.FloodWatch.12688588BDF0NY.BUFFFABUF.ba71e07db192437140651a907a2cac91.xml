<senderName>NWS Buffalo (Western New York)</senderName>
<headline>Flood Watch issued January 25 at 3:20PM EST until January 26 at 6:00PM EST by NWS Buffalo</headline>
<description>.Another round of steady rain is expected tonight, with rainfall
amounts possibly exceeding a half inch. Snowmelt and runoff will
increase tonight, bringing elevated flows to area creeks
and rivers.
Recent reports have indicated ice formation on the Buffalo area
creeks, as well as creeks and rivers in the western Southern Tier.
As creeks and rivers rise, a continued mild airmass will continue to
encourage the creek and river ice to break, leading to possible ice
jams and subsequent flooding. The ice is not particularly thick,
which will likely limit the potential for ice jam flooding.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and/or snowmelt and/or ice jam
continues to be possible.
* WHERE...A portion of western New York, including the following
counties, Chautauqua, Northern Erie and Southern Erie.
* WHEN...Through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The combination of snowmelt and rainfall runoff, combined
with the breakup of creek ice, may bring a limited potential
for minor flooding and minor ice jam flooding in low lying,
flood prone areas.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
