<headline>Flood Advisory issued January 25 at 4:11PM EST  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM EST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Central Henderson County in North Carolina.
* WHEN...Until 400 AM EST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks,
greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and
parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.
A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 401 PM EST, Doppler Radar indicates moderate rainfall has
ended across Henderson County and only period of light
rainfall is expected through tonight.  However, 1-2 inches of
rainfall has occurred over saturated soils over the past 12
hours and this has caused significant rises on area streams,
including along Mud Creek from Crab Creek to Hendersonville.
Expect nuisance flooding of adjacent low-lying areas along
some streams through this evening as high flows migrate
downstream towards the French Broad River.
-
The following streamgauge is above Action/Advisory Stage,
resulting in nuisance flooding along Mud Creek...
ID: MNMN7
NAME: Mud Creek at N Main St, 1 N Hendersonville
CURRENT STAGE: 11.56ft
TREND: Rising Steadily
ACTION/ADVISORY STAGE: 11.50ft
MINOR FLOOD STAGE: 14.00ft
ESTIMATED FORECAST: Mud Creek will likely crest at or below
12 feet within the next 2-4 hours and begin a quick recession
back below Action/Advisory Stage later this evening or early
tonight.
IMPACTS: Between 11 and 12 feet: Common, nuisance flooding of
low-lying areas adjacent to Mud Creek is beginning. The
lowest elevations of William H King Memorial Park are
beginning to flood and floodwaters are approaching the lowest
elevations of the Oklawaha Greenway.  At this stage, more
expansive lowland flooding with nuisance impacts to adjacent
farmland, golf courses, and nurseries is ongoing or has
recently occurred upstream closer to Erkwood Dr.
- Some locations that may experience nuisance flooding
include...
Hendersonville, Flat Rock, Mountain Home, Laurel Park, Valley
Hill, East Flat Rock, Dana, and Crab Creek.
