<headline>Air Quality Alert issued June 04 at 8:52AM CDT  by NWS Duluth</headline>
<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM MONDAY MORNING...
The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has issued an Air
Quality Advisory for particulates, or PM2.5, which will remain in
effect until 08:00 AM CDT Monday morning. This advisory affects
people in the following counties: Iron, Price, Rusk, Taylor, Vilas
and other counties in Wisconsin to the south and southwest.
Smoke originating from wildfires in Quebec, Canada is currently
impacting particulate concentrations at the surface across much of
the state. The air quality index is expected to range from the
UNHEALTHY FOR SENSITIVE GROUPS level to the UNHEALTHY level across
the advisory area.
In general, the lowest particulate concentrations are expected to
the northwest, while highest concentrations are expected near north
central and northeast Wisconsin, within and around the Fox River
Valley. It is recommended that people with heart or lung disease,
older adults, and children should avoid prolonged or heavy exertion,
while everyone else should reduce prolonged or heavy exertion.
