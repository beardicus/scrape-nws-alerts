<headline>Flood Advisory issued June 04 at 6:49PM MDT until June 06 at 6:00AM MDT by NWS Riverton</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 630 PM MDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Minor flooding and high river flows caused by excessive
rainfall from Sunday afternoon thunderstorms.
* WHERE...The Middle Fork Powder River and associated tributaries.
The Middle Fork Powder River runs next to WY Hwy 190 (Barnum Rd),
between Barnum WY and Kaycee WY in Johnson County.
* WHEN...The highest flows will likely take 6 to 12 hours to reach
Kaycee WY, but areas along the Middle Fork Powder River will be
affected throughout the evening and overnight. The Flood Advisory
continues through 630 PM MDT Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...Trained spotters reported the highest waters have
receded just upstream of where the Powder River Red Fork enters
the Middle Fork Powder River. The crest (highest waters) affected
portions of the agricultural areas along the river, and these
types of impacts will likely continue downstream.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 631 PM MDT, trained weather spotters measured heavy
rainfall earlier this afternoon of around 1 inch in 20
minutes. Radar estimates in the region show between 0.75 and
1.5 inches of rain had fallen in parts of the drainage. Minor
flooding is ongoing along the Middle Fork Powder River.
- This includes the following streams and drainages...
Middle Fork Powder River, Peterson Draw, Fisher Draw, Alkali
Creek, Powder River, Red Fork Powder River, Beaver Creek and
North Fork Powder River.
- Some locations that could experience high river flows and
minor flooding include...
Kaycee WY, and agricultural areas to the west of Kaycee along
WY Hwy 190 (Barnum Rd).</description>
<instruction>Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.</instruction>
