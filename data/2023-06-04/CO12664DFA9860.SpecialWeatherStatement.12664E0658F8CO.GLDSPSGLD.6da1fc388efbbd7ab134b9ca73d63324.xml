<description>...Brief Landspout Tornadoes Possible...
At 526 PM MDT, conditions are becoming favorable for the development
of landspout tornadoes in and close to the Cheyenne and Kit Carson
County area. However, at this time it is unknown which if any storm
would produce a landspout. Any tornadoes which develop are expected
to pose a limited threat.
Locations impacted include...
Cheyenne Wells, Stratton, Flagler, Seibert, Bethune, Kit Carson and
Vona.
To report severe weather, contact your nearest law enforcement
agency. They will send your report to the National Weather Service
office in Goodland.
Landspout tornadoes can form with a developing thunderstorm before
rain, hail, and even thunder is observed. Landspout tornadoes are not
usually associated with a wall cloud and are often difficult to
detect with weather radar.
