<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
A Flood Advisory for a recent burn area means that flooding and/or
debris flows are possible. Residents living in or immediately
downstream of burn areas should maintain awareness for potential
flooding and debris flows. Monitor conditions and emergency
management communications. If flooding and/or debris flows are
observed, move to a safe area away from the flooding.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
