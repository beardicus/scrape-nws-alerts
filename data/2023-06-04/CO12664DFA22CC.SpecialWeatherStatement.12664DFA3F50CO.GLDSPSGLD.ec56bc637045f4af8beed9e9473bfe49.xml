<description>...Brief Landspout Tornadoes Possible...
At 226 PM MDT, conditions are becoming favorable for the development
of landspout tornadoes in and close to the southern Kit Carson
County area. However, at this time it is unknown which if any storm
would produce a landspout. Any tornadoes which develop are expected
to pose a limited threat.
This landspout threat will remain over mainly rural areas of south
central Kit Carson County County.
Landspout tornadoes can form with a developing thunderstorm before
rain, hail, and even thunder is observed. Landspout tornadoes are not
usually associated with a wall cloud and are often difficult to
detect with weather radar.
