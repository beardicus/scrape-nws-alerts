<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued June 04 at 3:23PM EDT until June 04 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 AM EDT
MONDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, 1 to 2 feet inundation
above ground level expected in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways. For the Beach Hazards Statement, strong
longshore currents in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Coastal Onslow County, and Ocracoke Island.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 2 AM EDT Monday.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only isolated
road closures expected. High tide is in between 8 and 10 PM
tonight. Strong longshore currents will create dangerous
swimming conditions.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
