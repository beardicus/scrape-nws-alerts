<description>...POTENTIAL OF MODERATE TO HEAVY RAINFALL AND FLOODING THIS WEEK...
Widespread rain is expected to develop across the Ohio Valley and
southern Great Lakes between the Wednesday afternoon to early
Thursday timeframe of this week.  Indications suggest there is a
potential of 1 to 1.75 inches of liquid equivalent precipitation
during this period.
Snow water equivalents of the snowpack across these two counties
range from 1.50 inch to 2.50 inches across the deeper snowpack in
southwest Lower Michigan.  A sharp warming trend is expected for the
middle of the week that will result in a rapid melting of this
snowpack Wednesday and Wednesday night. Frozen ground across the
area will result in increased runoff of melting snow and of the
additional moderate to heavy precipitation later this week. If
rainfall amounts in the 1 to 2 inch range are realized, flooding of
low lying areas would be likely along with a potential of minor to
moderate river flooding.
In addition, ice activity on area rivers combined with higher river
levels later this week due to melting snow and additional
precipitation could locally exacerbate flood concerns due to break
up ice jam flooding.
People living in flood prone areas should closely monitor later
forecasts as there is still some uncertainty regarding precipitation
totals and where the axis of heaviest precipitation will fall.</description>
