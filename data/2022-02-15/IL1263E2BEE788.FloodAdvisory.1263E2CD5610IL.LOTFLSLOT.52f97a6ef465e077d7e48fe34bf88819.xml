<headline>Flood Advisory issued February 15 at 4:42PM CST until further notice by NWS Chicago</headline>
<description>...The Flood Advisory continues for the following rivers in
Illinois...
Kankakee River near Wilmington affecting Will, Kankakee and
Grundy Counties.
For the Kankakee River...including Wilmington...elevated river
levels are forecast.
...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE...
* WHAT...Minor flooding caused by an ice jam is expected. Additional
river rises due to snow melt and rainfall are possible.
* WHERE...Kankakee River near I-55 downstream of Wilmington,
including the Wilmington gauge.
* WHEN...Until further notice.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding of low-lying areas along the river near
and upstream of the ice jam.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 3:45 PM CST Tuesday the stage was 4.7 feet.
- Forecast...The river is expected to remain elevated for the
next couple days while the ice jam is in place. Later this
week, a combination of snow melt and rainfall may lead to
additional rises above flood stage. Shifting of upstream
river ice may also worsen the ice jam with little notice.
- Action stage is 5.0 feet.
- Flood stage is 6.5 feet.
&amp;&amp;</description>
<instruction>These forecasts are based on observed precipitation as well as
forecast precipitation 48 hours into the future. Changes to the
rainfall forecast, or any additional rainfall after 48 hours, may
cause changes to these river forecasts.
An ice jam is affecting water levels in this area. River forecasts
during ice jams are less certain due to many complicated factors.
Significant river ice cover can cause large water level fluctuations
and flooding with little advanced notice. River ice may also cause
gauge observations to be inaccurate.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov/Chicago and
water.weather.gov
The next statement is expected this evening.</instruction>
