<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY EVENING THROUGH LATE
THURSDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Ohio and northwest Pennsylvania, including the
following areas, in Ohio, Ashland, Ashtabula Inland, Ashtabula
Lakeshore, Crawford, Cuyahoga, Erie, Geauga, Hancock, Huron, Lake,
Lorain, Lucas, Mahoning, Medina, Ottawa, Portage, Richland,
Sandusky, Seneca, Stark, Summit, Trumbull, Wayne, Wood and
Wyandot. In northwest Pennsylvania, Crawford, Northern Erie and
Southern Erie.
* WHEN...From Wednesday evening through late Thursday night.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Warmer temperatures and gusty winds will cause the snowpack
across the area to begin quickly melting on Wednesday. In
addition, a system will bring 1 to 2 inches of rain across
the region late Wednesday night through Thursday evening. The
combination of rainfall and rapid snow melt will cause
significant rises on area streams, creeks, and rivers, with
some waterways likely to exceed flood stage. Ice jams may
also develop on frozen waterways and could become focus areas
for flooding.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
