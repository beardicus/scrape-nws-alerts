<headline>Flood Watch issued February 15 at 9:57AM CST until February 17 at 9:00PM CST by NWS Chicago</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY EVENING THROUGH
THURSDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by heavy rain, snowmelt, and break up ice
jams is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of east central Illinois and northwest Indiana,
including the following counties, in east central Illinois, Ford
and Iroquois. In northwest Indiana, Benton, Jasper and Newton.
* WHEN...From Wednesday evening through Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying, flood-prone, and poor
drainage areas. Also, rising river levels and warmer temperatures
may result in river ice becoming dislodged, increasing the risk of
localized ice jam flooding.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rainfall of one to two inches is expected Wednesday night
into Thursday morning which will be falling on frozen ground,
leading to quick runoff.
