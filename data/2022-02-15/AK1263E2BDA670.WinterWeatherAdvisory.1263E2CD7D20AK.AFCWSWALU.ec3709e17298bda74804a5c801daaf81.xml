<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued February 15 at 5:20AM AKST until February 16 at 9:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM THIS EVENING TO
9 AM AKST WEDNESDAY FOR THE KUSKOKWIM DELTA...
* WHAT...Snow and blowing snow. Northeast winds gusting as high
as 35 mph will reduce visibilities to one half mile at times.
Total snow accumulations of up to 8 inches.
* WHERE...Kuskokwim Delta.
* WHEN...From 9 PM this evening to 9 AM AKST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on difficult travel conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A low pressure system near Kuskokwim Bay
will bring multiple winter weather hazards to the area. A brief
period of freezing rain may be possible west of the Kuskokwim
Mountains for the villages of Eek and Quinhagak tomorrow evening
before temperatures at the surface rise above freezing around
midnight, transitioning precipitation to all rain. Areas along
the Kuskokwim Mountains may receive snow after the period of
light rain, but accumulations are expected to be minimal. Around
midnight, a band of heavy snow will develop between Bethel and
Chefornak, where the heaviest snow is most likely. To the north,
colder temperatures and stronger winds will produce blowing
snow from Toksook Bay to Hooper Bay. Low visibilities are also
possible in the band of heavy snow and over interior areas.</description>
