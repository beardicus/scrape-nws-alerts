<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued February 15 at 9:34PM AKST until February 16 at 9:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM AKST WEDNESDAY
FROM CLAM GULCH NORTH...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow accumulations of
up to two inches and ice accumulations of up to two tenths of
an inch.
* WHERE...Western Kenai Peninsula.
* WHEN...Until 9 AM AKST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning and evening commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow and freezing drizzle will overspread
the western Kenai Peninsula by midnight. The precipitation will
quickly changeover to rain for areas south of Clam Gulch as
warmer air moves up Cook Inlet. Temperatures from Clam Gulch
north are expected to remain at or slightly below freezing
through mid-morning Wednesday as warmer air aloft moves
overhead. This intrusion of warmer air aloft will allow for snow
to quickly transition to freezing rain. Freezing rain is
expected to continue through the late morning or early afternoon
hours before colder air begins to move back over the region and
the precipitation transitions back to snow or a rain/snow mix
before ending by mid-afternoon.</description>
