<description>...Heavy Rainfall and Shifting River Ice Remain Likely...
Warmer temperatures today into tomorrow will be followed by
widespread rainfall Wednesday night into Thursday, some of which may
be heavy in localized areas. Due to a combination of snow melt and
rainfall, significant river rises are likely with water levels near
flood stage possible. Conditions are also favorable for break-up ice
jams, with this risk increasing by late week, especially on the
Kankakee, Iroquois, and Vermilion Rivers, due to heavy ice cover
currently in place. This flood potential exists from today through
the weekend.
Snow cover contains up to one inch of water equivalent, most of
which will melt by Thursday morning, adding to runoff due to
rainfall. Soil frost depths range from 6 to 12 inches across the
outlook area, which may be enough to reduce infiltration from
rainfall and snow melt. Soil moisture across the area is near
average, which will not significantly impact flood risk. Overall,
conditions are generally increasing the risk of flooding if heavy
rainfall was to occur.
River forecasts based upon 48 hours of future rainfall indicate
significant river rises and near flood stage conditions at multiple
locations in the outlook area, especially in the Iroquois and
Kankakee river basins. Recent reports from river ice spotters and
imagery from satellite indicate that heavy ice cover still exists in
several areas. River rises from a combination of ongoing snow melt
and future rainfall are likely to break up ice cover in some areas,
which may lead to break-up ice jams. Ice jams can develop quickly
and lead to rapid water level fluctuations with little or no notice.
This outlook means that elevated water levels and potential impacts
are possible, but not yet certain. Persons should closely monitor
the latest forecasts and statements, including possible flood
watches and warnings.
The next outlook update is expected by tomorrow morning.</description>
