<headline>Flood Watch issued February 15 at 1:40PM EST  by NWS Cleveland</headline>
<description>.Heavy rain may fall on a deep primed snowpack leading to the melt
increasing. Flows in rivers may increase quickly and reach critical
levels.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY EVENING THROUGH LATE
THURSDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Ohio and northwest Pennsylvania, including the
following areas, in Ohio, Ashland, Ashtabula Inland, Ashtabula
Lakeshore, Crawford, Cuyahoga, Erie, Geauga, Hancock, Huron, Lake,
Lorain, Lucas, Mahoning, Medina, Ottawa, Portage, Richland,
Sandusky, Seneca, Stark, Summit, Trumbull, Wayne, Wood and
Wyandot. In northwest Pennsylvania, Crawford, Northern Erie and
Southern Erie.
* WHEN...From Wednesday evening through late Thursday night.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. The greatest threat for flooding
will be in ice jam prone areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Significant warming ahead of a slow moving cold front will
result in a melt down of an extensive snow pack over the
region. While this warming will begin on Wednesday, runoff
from this melt water will not reach the tributaries until
Wednesday evening or Thursday. A storm system will track out
of the Ohio Valley late Wednesday night and Thursday. This
weather system is forecast to bring 1 an 2 inches of rainfall
across northern Ohio into northwest Pennsylvania on Thursday.
The combination of the heavy rainfall and extensive snow melt
may result in significant rises on area streams and rivers.
The rapid warm up may also cause ice jams and additional
focus areas for flooding on local waterways.

Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
