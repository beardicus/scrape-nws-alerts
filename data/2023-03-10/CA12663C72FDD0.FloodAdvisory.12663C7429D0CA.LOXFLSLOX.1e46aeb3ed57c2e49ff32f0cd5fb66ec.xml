<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas. The rain will likely trigger
shallow mud and debris flows, minor rock falls, and flooding capable
of localized damage, especially in steep terrain in and near burn
scars.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.</instruction>
