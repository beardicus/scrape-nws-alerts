<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WILL AFFECT EASTERN RICH...NORTHERN SUMMIT AND
CENTRAL UINTA COUNTIES...
At 613 PM MST...A snow squall was near Evanston...moving east at 45
mph.
Locations impacted include...
Evanston, Lyman, Robertson, Mountain View, Millburne, Fort Bridger,
Almy, Altamont, Carter, Ragen, Church Buttes, Piedmont and Leroy.
This includes Interstate 80 across Uinta County, Wyoming.
* strong winds in excess of 45 mph are possible with this squall.
* visibilities will drop quickly to less than a half mile in this
squall.
Rapid visibility reduction and potentially icy roads are likely to

driving conditions, reduce speed and make sure headlights are on to
increase the visibility of your vehicle to those around you.</description>
