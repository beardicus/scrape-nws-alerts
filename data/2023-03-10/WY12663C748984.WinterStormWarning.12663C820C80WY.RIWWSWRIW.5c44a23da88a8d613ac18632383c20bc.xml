remain possible through 530 PM. Farther east across the Wind

Additional snow accumulations across the Wind River Mountains
of 3 to 5 inches are possible.

could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Back country enthusiasts, including
snowmobilers, should exercise caution as conditions could be
very dangerous. For back country and avalanche information
