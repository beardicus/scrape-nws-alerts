<headline>Rip Current Statement issued March 10 at 4:08PM AST until March 13 at 6:00AM AST by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE SUNDAY
NIGHT...
* WHAT...Dangerous rip currents expected.
* WHERE...Beaches of Vieques and St. Croix.
* WHEN...Through at least late Sunday night.
* IMPACTS...Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.</instruction>
