<headline>Flood Advisory issued March 10 at 4:34AM PST until March 10 at 1:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 AM PST THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Urban and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall continues.
* WHERE...western and central San Luis Obispo County.
* WHEN...Until 700 AM PST.
* IMPACTS...Widespread ponding of water on area roadways and
flooding of low-lying areas and intersections continues across the
advisory area. Mudslides and rockslides are likely on canyon
roads. There will likely be sharp rises in small streams and
normally dry arroyos.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 426 AM PST, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated moderate to heavy rain across most of the advisory
area. Many locations were reporting rainfall rates of 0.30 to
0.50 inches per hour, with local rates up to one inch per
hour in the mountains. Rainfall totals so far have averaged
1.50 inches to 3.0 inches, with local totals to about 6
inches across the higher terrain.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches are expected
over the area, except up to 10 inches in the higher terrain
of northwestern San Luis Obispo County. This additional rain
will continue to result in widespread ponding of water,
flooding of low lying areas and intersections, as well as
rises in creeks and streams.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
San Luis Obispo, Paso Robles, Morro Bay, Pismo Beach,
Atascadero, Arroyo Grande, Nipomo, Cambria, Grover Beach,
Santa Margarita, Highway 101 over Cuesta Grade, Templeton,
Lake Lopez, Black Mountain, Shell Beach, Avila Beach,
Baywood-Los Osos and Oceano.

<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas. The rain will likely trigger
shallow mud and debris flows, minor rock falls, and flooding capable
of localized damage, especially in steep terrain in and near burn
scars.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.</instruction>
