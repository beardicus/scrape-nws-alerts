<headline>Flood Advisory issued March 10 at 1:23AM PST until March 11 at 7:46AM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 AM PST THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Urban and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...western and central San Luis Obispo County.
* WHEN...Until 700 AM PST.
* IMPACTS...Widespread ponding of water on area roadways and local
flooding of low lying areas and intersections was occurring across
the advisory area. Mudslides and rockslides are possible on canyon
roads. There will likely be sharp rises in small streams and
normally dry arroyos.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 107 AM PST, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated moderate to heavy rain across much of the advisory
area. Many locations were reporting rainfall rates of 0.20 to
0.40 inches per hour, with local rates up to one half inch
per hour. Rainfall totals so far have averaged 0.75 inches to
1.5 inches, with local totals to almost 3 inches across the
higher terrain.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches are expected
during the next several hours, with more than 4 inches
possible across the higher terrain in the northwestern
portion of the county. This additional rain will continue to
result in widespread ponding of water, flooding of low lying
areas and intersections, and rises in creeks and streams.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
San Luis Obispo, Paso Robles, Morro Bay, Pismo Beach,
Atascadero, Arroyo Grande, Nipomo, Cambria, Grover Beach,
Santa Margarita, Highway 101 over Cuesta Grade, Templeton,
Lake Lopez, Shell Beach, Avila Beach, Baywood-Los Osos and
Oceano.

<instruction>The rain will likely trigger shallow mud and debris flows, minor
rock falls, and flooding capable of localized damage, especially in
steep terrain.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.</instruction>
