<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 AM MST
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...A period of very heavy snow is expected to impact areas
from just north of Jackson, southward across Star Valley to Salt
River Pass on the south end of Star Valley. This includes the
southern Teton Mountains, and the Salt River and Wyoming Ranges.
This will occur between 315 PM and 445 PM. Some lightning is
possible with this activity. Snow rates of 1 to 2 inches are
expected. Any rain in the lower elevations should quickly change
to snow with this heavy precipitation. Wind gusts of 40 to 60
mph could occur both in the mountains and the valleys as this
moves across. Near whiteout conditions could occur. A very quick
1 to 2 inches of snow is likely with this heavy snowfall.
* WHERE...Yellowstone National Park, Teton and Gros Ventre
Mountains, Wind River Mountains West, Wind River Mountains
East and Salt River and Wyoming Ranges.
* WHEN...Until 5 AM MST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult, especially during
the Friday evening commute, and across Mountain Passes. Areas
of blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Back country enthusiasts, including
snowmobilers, should exercise caution as conditions could be
very dangerous. For back country and avalanche information
please see the Bridger-Teton Avalanche Center website at
bridgertetonavalanchecenter.org.</description>
