<headline>High Wind Warning issued March 10 at 3:22AM AKST until March 10 at 9:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM AKST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Northeast winds 45 to 65 mph with gusts up to 80 mph
expected.
* WHERE...Valdez through Thompson Pass.
* WHEN...From 1 AM to 9 PM AKST Friday.
* IMPACTS...High winds may move loose debris, damage property,
and cause power outages. Travel will be difficult, especially
for high profile vehicles.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Expect a fairly long duration of elevated
winds. Winds will peak late morning through midday today, and
then will slowly diminish this afternoon through early Saturday.
While the snowpack is largely hardened due to the recent
freeze/thaw cycle, winds will be strong enough to produce
localized areas of blowing and drifting snow.</description>
<instruction>People are urged to secure loose objects that could be blown
around or damaged by the wind. Prepare for the possibility of
widespread power outages. Use caution if you must drive.</instruction>
