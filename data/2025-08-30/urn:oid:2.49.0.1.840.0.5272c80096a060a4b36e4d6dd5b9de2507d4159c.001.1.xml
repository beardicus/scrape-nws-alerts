        <headline>Flood Advisory issued August 30 at 12:33AM AKDT until August 31 at 2:00AM AKDT by NWS Anchorage AK</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...Flooding caused by previous excessive rainfall is expected.

* WHERE...Matanuska River.

* WHEN...Until 200 AM AKDT Sunday.

* IMPACTS...River levels have exceeded those observed in early July
and early August, and increased bank erosion is expected along the
lower Matanuska River. Minor flooding is expected in low-lying and
poor drainage areas along and near the Matanuska River.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1221 AM AKDT, river gauge reports indicate rises in water
levels from previous days heavy rain across the advisory
area. This will cause minor flooding from overflow of poor
drainage areas, especially along and near the Matanuska
River.
-     Impacts:
At 15000.0 cfs: Action Flow - This discharge (flow) level
represents the higher end of the typical summertime range,
and will likely be reached at least once nearly every year.
Localized minor out-of-bank flooding may start to occur along
parts of the Glenn highway, especially east of Sutton from
milepost 64 to 66.
At 30000.0 cfs: Minor Flood Flow - This discharge (flow)
level has a roughly 20 percent chance of being reached in any
given year. Additional vulnerable locations near the active
river channel may experience some flooding at this level west
of the Old Glenn Highway in the Butte and near Sutton from
Milepost 64 to 66. Residents are advised that for the past
several years at both of these locations, the main channel of
the river has been shifting closer to the bank.
At 35000.0 cfs: Moderate Flood Flow - This discharge (flow)
level has a roughly 10 percent chance of being reached in any
given year. Flooding near vulnerable locations along the
active river channel may become more significant and
widespread. This level was reached during the flooding in
2012.
- For Matanuska River at Palmer:
At 11:30pm the stage was 39300.0 cfs.
Forecast: The river looks to have crested and is expected to
begin falling through the day Saturday.

Butte stay alert and be prepared to take action.
