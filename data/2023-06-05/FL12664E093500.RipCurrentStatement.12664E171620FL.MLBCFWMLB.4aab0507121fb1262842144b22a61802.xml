<headline>Rip Current Statement issued June 05 at 3:04PM EDT until June 06 at 6:00AM EDT by NWS Melbourne</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 AM EDT
TUESDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE TONIGHT...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding.
For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 5 to 7
feet in the surf zone. For the High Rip Current Risk,
dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...All central Florida Atlantic beaches, but especially
Volusia County, which remains particularly vulnerable due to
leftover coastal damage from hurricanes Ian and Nicole last
fall.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 2 AM EDT Tuesday.
For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT this evening. For
the High Rip Current Risk, through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Some flooding of low-lying lots, parks and roadways
may occur near the shoreline. Isolated road closures are
possible. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>Onshore winds and above normal tides will combine to generate
flooding of low areas along the shore. Do not drive around
barricades or through water of unknown depth. Take the necessary
actions to protect flood-prone property.
High surf will affect the beaches in the advisory area, producing
localized beach erosion and dangerous swimming conditions.
Swimmers should remain out of the water due to large breaking
waves and dangerous surf conditions.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as jetties and
piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.</instruction>
