* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 845 PM MDT, Heavy rain that occurred earlier in the

rapid rise in water, with a jump from 3.07 ft to 4.13 ft over
the past 3 hours at its gauge located at Canyon. The Tongue
River and Big Goose Creek are also beginning to see rises,
just not as rapid. This will cause small stream flooding
downstream as water will rapidly flow down the mountains.
Between 1 and 3 inches of rain fell earlier in the evening.
- This includes the following streams and drainages...
The Little and Big Goose Creeks, Tongue River, and their
associated tributaries within the advised area.
Additional rainfall amounts up to half an inch are expected
over the area. This additional rain will result in minor
flooding. Rises in streams through Sheridan may occur
overnight.
