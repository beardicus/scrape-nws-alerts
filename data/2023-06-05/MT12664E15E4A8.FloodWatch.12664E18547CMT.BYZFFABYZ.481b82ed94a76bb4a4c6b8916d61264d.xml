- Since 3 PM, the Musselshell River at Shawmut has been
hovering around 7.8 ft, and its forecast also has this
plateau trend continuing, and staying just below flood stage.

<instruction>Residents and those with interests near the river should monitor
rising water levels and be prepared for possible flood warnings.
Do not enter or cross flowing water or water of unknown depth.
Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe due to erosion.
A Flood Watch means that flooding is possible. Now is the time to
prepare for action in the event flooding occurs.
Stay tuned to further developments by listening to your local radio,
television, or NOAA Weather Radio for further information.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency officials and
request they pass the information to the National Weather Service in
Billings.
