<description>...AIR QUALITY ADVISORY EXTENDED FOR IRON AND PRICE COUNTIES...
The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has extended the Air
Quality Advisory for PM2.5 which will now remain in effect until
midnight Monday night. This advisory affects people living in the
following counties: Iron and Price.
Smoke originating from wildfires in Quebec, Canada continues
impacting PM2.5 concentrations at the surface across much of the
state. The air quality index is expected to range from the UNHEALTHY
FOR SENSITIVE GROUPS level to the UNHEALTHY level across the
advisory area. In general, the lowest PM2.5 concentrations are
expected to the northwest and southeast, while the highest
concentrations are expected within the corridor south of a
Minneapolis/St Paul, MN to Ironwood, MI line and north of a Dubuque,
IA to Green Bay, WI line. It is recommended that people with heart
or lung disease, older adults, and children avoid prolonged or heavy
exertion, while everyone else should reduce prolonged or heavy
exertion.
