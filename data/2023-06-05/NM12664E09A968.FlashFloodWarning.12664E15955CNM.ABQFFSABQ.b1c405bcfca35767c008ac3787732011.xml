<instruction>Runoff from rainfall will cause elevated water levels within
vulnerable drainages in and downstream of the Cerro Pelado Burn Scar.
Do not camp along streams and rivers. Remain alert when hiking in
steep, narrow canyons. Know where you are relative to low spots and
drainages.
This is a life threatening situation. Heavy rainfall will cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks, streams and ditches
in the Cerro Pelado Burn Scar. Severe debris flows can also be
anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may be washed away in
places. If you encounter flood waters, climb to safety.</instruction>
