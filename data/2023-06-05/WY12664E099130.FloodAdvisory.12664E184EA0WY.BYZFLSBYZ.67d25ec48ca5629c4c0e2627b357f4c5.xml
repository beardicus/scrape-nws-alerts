- At 334 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms up in the Bighorn Mountains. This will cause

fallen.
- This includes the following streams and drainages...
The Big and Little Goose Creeks, Little Tongue River, and
their associated tributaries.
Additional rainfall amounts of 0.5 to 2 inches are expected
over the Bighorn Mountains. This additional rain will result
in minor flooding.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Sheridan, Ranchester, Dayton and Big Horn.
- Outdoor recreationists in the mountains will be impacted, as
that is where the heavy rain is occurring at.
