<description>...The Flood Watch continues for the following rivers in Montana...
Musselshell River near Lavina affecting Golden Valley County.
Musselshell River near Shawmut affecting Wheatland County.
.Heavy rainfall over the weekend, combined with the Musselshell
River already flowing high with snowmelt, may result in minor
flooding at times this week. In addition to the flood potential, the
potential for significant bank erosion is very high with water
flowing at these levels.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE...
* WHAT...Flooding is possible.
* WHERE...Musselshell River near Lavina.
* WHEN...Until further notice.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding of low lying areas near the river is
possible. Significant bank erosion is likely.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 7:30 PM MDT Monday the stage was 8.6 feet.
- Despite a recent plateau of the Musselshell River at Lavina,
forecasts still expect it to rise to just below FLood Stage
by Tuesday evening. Over the next few days, any rain shower
or storm that occurs over the river will likely bring it into
flood stage.
- Forecast...Flood stage may be reached based on the latest
forecast information.
- Flood stage is 9.5 feet.

<instruction>Residents and those with interests near the river should monitor
rising water levels and be prepared for possible flood warnings.
Do not enter or cross flowing water or water of unknown depth.
Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe due to erosion.
A Flood Watch means that flooding is possible. Now is the time to
prepare for action in the event flooding occurs.
Stay tuned to further developments by listening to your local radio,
television, or NOAA Weather Radio for further information.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency officials and
request they pass the information to the National Weather Service in
Billings.
