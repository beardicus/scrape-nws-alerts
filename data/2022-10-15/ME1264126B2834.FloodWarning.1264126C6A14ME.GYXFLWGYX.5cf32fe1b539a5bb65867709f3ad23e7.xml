<headline>Flood Warning issued October 15 at 12:21AM EDT  by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 730 AM EDT THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...A portion of western Maine, including the following
counties, Franklin and Oxford.
* WHEN...Until 730 AM EDT Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding from earlier rainfall will continue through the
overnight.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1216 AM EDT, Gauge reports indicated flooding on the Ellis
River. It is likely additional small streams and creeks in
the area are likewise out of their banks. Though the rainfall
is exiting the area, runoff from the earlier rainfall will
keep streams elevated through the overnight. Between 2 and 4
inches of rain have fallen.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Bethel, Rumford, Dixfield, Andover, Mexico, Weld, Grafton,
Phillips, Wilton, and Carthage.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
