<headline>Air Quality Alert issued October 15 at 4:42PM PDT  by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM PDT SUNDAY...
An Air Pollution Advisory, issued by the Oregon Department of
Environmental Quality, remains in effect for Coos County until 8 AM
PDT Sunday.
The Cedar Creek Fire in Willamette National Forest, combined with
occasional easterly winds, is likely to cause air quality of
Moderate to Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups, at times, across inland
portions of Coos County. Members of sensitive groups may experience
health effects. The general public is not likely to be adversely
affected.
Air Quality is likely to remain mostly Good along and near the
coast due to the effects of the marine layer.
