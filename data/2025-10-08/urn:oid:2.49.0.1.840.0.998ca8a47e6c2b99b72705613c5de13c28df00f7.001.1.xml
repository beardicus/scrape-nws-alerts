        <headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued October 8 at 4:05PM EDT until October 11 at 5:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City NC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents.
For the Coastal Flood Advisory, 1 to 3 feet of inundation above
ground level expected in low-lying areas near shorelines and
tidal waterways. For the Coastal Flood Watch, 2 to 4 feet of
inundation above ground level possible in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways.

* WHERE...For the Coastal Flood Watch and Advisory, areas along
Hatteras and Ocracoke Island beaches, Pamlico Sound, and
adjacent tidal creeks. For the Beach Hazards Statement, the
beaches south of Cape Hatteras.

* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, until 8 PM EDT this
evening. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 7 AM Thursday to
5 PM EDT Saturday. For the Coastal Flood Watch, from Saturday
afternoon through Monday morning.

* IMPACTS...For the Beach Hazards Statement, rip currents can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to 1 to 3 feet of inundation
above ground level with minor ocean overwash possible in
vulnerable locations along shorelines and tidal waterways. For
the Coastal Flood Watch, up to 2 to 4 feet of inundation above
ground level is possible in some areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways resulting in an elevated threat of property damage
around the times of high tide. Flooding will extend inland from
the waterfront threatening some homes and businesses. Numerous
road closures and flooding of vehicles will be possible, most
notably along NC 12 where ocean overwash may make several
portions of the highway inaccessible across Ocracoke and
Hatteras Islands.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A strong coastal storm will develop this
weekend off the North Carolina coast, and has the potential to
bring stronger winds and higher water levels to the area.
Depending on the exact track and strength of the low, there is
potential for major coastal flooding impacts from ocean
overwash, and users are urged to check back in on the forecast
the rest of the week.

        <instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.

Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
