<headline>High Surf Warning issued January 13 at 5:18PM ChST until January 14 at 6:00PM ChST by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM CHST SATURDAY...
...HIGH RISK OF RIP CURRENTS THROUGH SUNDAY AFTERNOON...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM SATURDAY TO 6 PM
SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Dangerously large breaking waves of 12 to 16 feet and
dangerous rip currents expected along north and east facing reefs.
* WHERE...For the High Surf Warning, along north-facing reefs Tinian
and Saipan. For the High Surf Advisory and the High Rip Current
Risk, north- and east-facing reefs.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Warning, until 6 PM ChST Saturday.
For the High Surf Advisory, from 6 PM Saturday to 6 PM ChST
Sunday. For the High Rip Current Risk, through Sunday
afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Breaking waves can sweep people off jetties and
docks, and into dangerous seas. Life-threatening swimming
conditions and significant beach erosion can be expected. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Tinian and Saipan will continue to incur the
biggest impact from the large northeast swell. Tanapag buoy
reported maximum wave heights of 20 to 30 feet. Swell is expected
to turn more from the east and gradually subside Saturday afternoon
into evening, downgrading to an advisory and be extended to east-
facing reefs when the warning expires.</description>
<instruction>Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other waterside
infrastructure.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
