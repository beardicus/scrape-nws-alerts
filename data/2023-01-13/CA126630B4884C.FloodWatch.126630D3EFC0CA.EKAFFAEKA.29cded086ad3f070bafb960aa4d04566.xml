<headline>Flood Watch issued January 13 at 2:19AM PST until January 15 at 8:00AM PST by NWS Eureka</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of northwest California, including the following
areas, Mendocino Coast, Northeastern Mendocino Interior, Northern
Lake, Northwestern Mendocino Interior, Southeastern Mendocino
Interior, Southern Humboldt Interior, Southern Lake, Southern
Trinity, Southwestern Humboldt and Southwestern Mendocino Interior.
* WHEN...From late tonight through Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Area creeks
and streams are running high and could flood with more heavy rain.
Rainfall on already saturated soils will increase the risk of rock
and mudslides.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Showers over the past 24 hours have kept soils very
saturated. Another strong pulse of moisture will bring more
rain late tonight into early Saturday. Models show a
relatively concentrated period or precipitation totaling 1.5
to 3 inches across the southern portions of the area. That
amount of rainfall over roughly 12 hours will increase the
risk of flooding.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
