<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.

dangers of flooding.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
