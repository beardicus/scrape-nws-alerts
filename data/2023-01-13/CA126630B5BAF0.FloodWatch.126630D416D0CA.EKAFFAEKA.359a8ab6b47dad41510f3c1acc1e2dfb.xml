<headline>Flood Watch issued January 13 at 10:04AM PST until January 15 at 9:00AM PST by NWS Eureka</headline>
<description>...AREAL FLOOD WATCH CONTINUES THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Localized flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues...
with additional areas possible over the next 24 hours.
* WHERE...Portions of northwest California, including the following
areas, Mendocino Coast, Northeastern Mendocino Interior, Northern
Lake, Northwestern Mendocino Interior, Southeastern Mendocino
Interior, Southern Humboldt Interior, Southern Lake, Southern
Trinity, Southwestern Humboldt and Southwestern Mendocino Interior.
* WHEN...Through Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Area creeks
and streams are running high and could flood with more heavy rain.
Specific flooding is possible along the Garcia River near Pt. Arena
along Hwy 101 through early Sunday morning.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Moderate rainfall over the past 24 hours have kept soils very
saturated. Another strong pulse of moisture will bring more
rain late tonight into early Saturday. Models show a
relatively concentrated period or precipitation totaling 1.5
to 3 inches across the southern portions of the area. That
amount of rainfall over roughly 12 hours will increase the
risk of flooding.

<instruction>You should monitor future forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop. When driving...&quot;Turn
Around, Don`t Drown&quot;.</instruction>
