<description>...SNOW IMPACTS ON SIERRA PASSES TODAY FOLLOWED BY A SERIES OF
STRONGER STORMS...
A series of storms will impact the Sierra and western Nevada beginning
this holiday weekend and continuing into next week, resulting in an
extended period of travel disruptions.
TODAY:
* The initial, weaker system today will mainly impact the west
slopes of the Sierra with upwards of 8 inches possible on the
Sierra crest passes this afternoon and evening. Lighter amounts
of snowfall are expected down in the Tahoe Basin, but still a
few inches of accumulation are possible. Intermittent, light
rain showers will be possible for far western Nevada. While this
initial system is relatively weak, the snow will exacerbate
travel impacts for the evening commute and ski/holiday traffic.
Plan on the potential for delays and slowdowns. Have a winter
kit in your vehicle with supplies (food, water, clothing,
blankets, flashlights, etc.)
* A period of stronger winds may impact Mineral county this
afternoon and evening, especially along Highway 95 near Walker
Lake. There is a 45% chance of wind gusts exceeding 50 mph for a
period of time between 11 am and 4 pm today.
REST OF THE WEEKEND:
* The subsequent storms will provide much more widespread impacts
with the heaviest snowfall rates poised to arrive Saturday and
Monday with brief lull on Sunday when lower intensity snowfall
rates are expected. Rain and snow showers will be possible in
western Nevada with Monday being the best chance for snow to
valley floors.
* Strong winds are expected along Sierra ridges for the weekend
into early next week with wind gusts approaching 100 mph at
times, especially Saturday and Monday.</description>
