<description>...SNOW IMPACTS ON SIERRA PASSES CONTINUE THIS EVENING FOLLOWED
BY A SERIES OF STRONGER STORMS INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK...
A series of winter storms will impact the Sierra and western
Nevada through the holiday weekend with an extended period of
travel disruptions expected.
THIS EVENING:
* The first in a series of storms will continue to impact Sierra
tonight. The main impacts with this storm will be focused along
the Sierra passes and west slopes with upwards of 8 inches
possible on the Sierra crest passes. Lighter amounts of
snowfall are expected down in the Tahoe Basin with a few inches
of accumulation possible. Intermittent, light rain showers will
be possible for far western Nevada. While this initial system is
relatively weak compared to the incoming storm on Saturday, the
snow will exacerbate travel impacts for the evening commute and
ski/holiday traffic. Plan on the potential for delays and
slowdowns. Have a winter kit in your vehicle with supplies
(food, water, clothing, blankets, flashlights, etc.)
* A period of stronger winds may impact the Tahoe Basin, Pyramid
Lake, and Mineral county this evening. US-95 near Walker Lake
will be particularly vulnerable to the stronger winds with a 45%
chance of wind gusts exceeding 50 mph for a period of time
through 7 pm today. Plan on hazardous boating conditions at
Lake Tahoe and Pyramid Lake as wind gusts approach 50 mph by
this afternoon.
REST OF THE WEEKEND:
* SIERRA: The next wave of storms will provide widespread impacts
with the heaviest snowfall rates expected to arrive Saturday and
Monday with a brief lull in between on Sunday. Feet of snowfall
will be possible. Strong winds are expected along Sierra ridges
for the weekend into early next week with wind gusts
approaching 100 mph at times, especially Saturday and Monday.
* WESTERN NEVADA: Valleys will see gusty southerly winds on
Saturday with gusts up to 45 mph in the valleys. Spillover
rainfall is possible Saturday afternoon before snow levels drop
and provide a rain/snow mix on the valley floors beginning late
afternoon-early evening. Up to an inch of slushy accumulation
will be possible through early evening on the valley floors with
areas above 5000 feet seeing up to 3 inches (35% chance)
including: Washoe Valley, Virginia City/Highlands, and foothill
areas.</description>
