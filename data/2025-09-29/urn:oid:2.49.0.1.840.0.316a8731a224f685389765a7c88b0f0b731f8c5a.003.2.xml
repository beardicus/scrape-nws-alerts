        <headline>High Surf Advisory issued September 29 at 11:10AM EDT until October 1 at 11:00AM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City NC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip
currents. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of
5 to 8 feet expected in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood
Advisory, minor coastal flooding, 1 to 2 feet of inundation
above ground level expected in low- lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways.

* WHERE...West Carteret County.

* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, from 8 AM EDT this
morning through this evening. For the High Surf Advisory, from
11 AM Tuesday to 11 AM EDT Wednesday. For the Coastal Flood
Advisory, from 11 PM Tuesday to 8 PM EDT Thursday. Impacts
greatest during the afternoon high tide cycles.

* IMPACTS...Minor inundation, 1 to 2 feet above ground level, is
possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways resulting in a low threat of property damage. Some
roads and low lying property including parking lots, parks,
lawns, and homes adjacent to the waterfront will experience
shallow flooding. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions
and localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the
best swimmers away from shore into deeper water. The most
likely time for strong rip currents to occur is a couple hours
either side of low tide, which will occur around 7:00 PM
Monday.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
</description>
        <instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.

Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.

Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
