<description>...LOCALIZED BLOWING AND DRIFTING SNOW.  ANOTHER ROUND OF MODERATE

possibly cause significant visibility reductions.
Moderate to heavy snow is falling across portions of Central and
Northern Washington and will spread from the Cascades into northeast
Washington and north Idaho by Monday morning.  Lighter snow
accumulations are expected across the Columbia Basin and
Spokane-Cd`A Area.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM PST THIS

gusting 35 to 65 mph with the strongest winds near Gifford and

Peck.
* WHEN...Until 4 PM PST this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Some roads in the vicinity of the Lewiston area that are
exposed to south winds may experience significant drifting and
blowing snow and could result in localized blizzard conditions.
Do not attempt to drive on roads that have been closed by local
authorities.  High winds in eastern Nez Perce County may result in
downed power lines and trees.</description>
