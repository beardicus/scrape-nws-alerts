<headline>High Wind Warning issued January 03 at 11:20AM AKST until January 05 at 6:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AKST WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Northeast winds 35 to 45 mph with gusts of 60 to 75 mph
expected. Localized whiteout conditions possible due to blowing
snow.
* WHERE...Matanuska Valley.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM AKST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...High winds will continue to sweep away loose debris,
damage property, and cause power outages. Travel will be
difficult, especially for high profile vehicles. Tie down small
aircraft. Crosswinds may also cause issues for aircraft.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Northeast winds will persist the next
couple days. Wind chill values from 20 below to 35 below zero
are expected with these winds. This could cause dangerous life-
threatening conditions for those without power, as frostbite can
develop in as little as 15 minutes in these conditions.</description>
<instruction>People are urged to secure loose objects that could be blown
around or damaged by the wind. Prepare for the possibility of
widespread power outages. Use caution if you must drive.</instruction>
