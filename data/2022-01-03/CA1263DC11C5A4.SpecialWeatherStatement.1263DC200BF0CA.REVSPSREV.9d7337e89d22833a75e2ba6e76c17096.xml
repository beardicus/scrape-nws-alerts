<description>...Very Strong Winds and Mountain Snow Through Tuesday Morning...
* Our first winter storm of 2022 has arrived with very strong and
potentially damaging winds, light to moderate mountain snow, and
a few light valley rain and snow showers. The snowfall with this
system won`t be very significant; however there will be travel
difficulties due to snow-covered roads and localized areas of
blowing and drifting snow. Travel overnight will be challenging,
especially in the Sierra from Tahoe north, and for the passes
of northeast California.
* Gusty winds are whipping through northeast California, the Tahoe
Basin and western Nevada. Wind gusts between 60-80 mph have
already occurred in areas along I-580 in Washoe Valley. There is
is potential for gusts to exceed 80 mph through tonight,
especially in wind prone locations along the US-395 and I-580
corridor between Susanville and northern Mono County, in
addition to the Surprise Valley and far northern Washoe County
near the Oregon border. Elsewhere, gusts of 30-50 mph are
anticipated for valley locations, with Sierra ridge gusts
exceeding 100 mph.
* There have been reports of blowing snow in Washoe Valley and
near Susanville resulting in vehicle incidents and poor
visibility. Plan on the following impacts through Tuesday
morning: some tree falls and power outages along with travel
restrictions for high profile vehicles, and very rough air for
aviators. Backcountry recreation, ski areas and lakes will be
impacted by the winds, blowing snow, and very choppy lake
conditions.
* Be sure to charge your phones, locate your flashlights and extra
batteries, and ensure you have a backup plan for meals if power
outages occur due to the strong winds through Tuesday morning.</description>
