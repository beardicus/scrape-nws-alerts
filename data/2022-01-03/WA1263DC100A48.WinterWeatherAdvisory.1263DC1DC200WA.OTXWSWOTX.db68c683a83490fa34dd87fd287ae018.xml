<description>...LOCALIZED BLOWING AND DRIFTING SNOW.  ANOTHER ROUND OF MODERATE
TO HEAVY SNOW TODAY...

across the Palouse, Pomeroy area, and the Camas Prairie this
morning.  The threat for blowing and drifting snow will expand north

Northern Washington and will spread from the Cascades into northeast
Washington and north Idaho by Monday morning.  Lighter snow
accumulations are expected across the Columbia Basin and
Spokane-Cd`A Area.

* WHAT...Snow expected. Snow accumulations between 1 and 3 inches.

toward the Saddle Mountains.  Wind gusts near 35 mph could result
in localized blowing and drifting snow.
* WHERE...Grand Coulee, Coulee City, Quincy, Wilbur, Ephrata,
Ritzville, Harrington, Othello, Odessa, Moses Lake, and Creston.
* WHEN...Until 4 PM PST this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will
