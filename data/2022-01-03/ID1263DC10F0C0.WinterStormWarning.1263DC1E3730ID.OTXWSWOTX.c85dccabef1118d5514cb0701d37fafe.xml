<description>...LOCALIZED BLOWING AND DRIFTING SNOW.  ANOTHER ROUND OF MODERATE
TO HEAVY SNOW TODAY...

across the Palouse, Pomeroy area, and the Camas Prairie this

possibly cause significant visibility reductions.

Northern Washington and will spread from the Cascades into northeast
Washington and north Idaho by Monday morning.  Lighter snow
accumulations are expected across the Columbia Basin and
Spokane-Cd`A Area.
