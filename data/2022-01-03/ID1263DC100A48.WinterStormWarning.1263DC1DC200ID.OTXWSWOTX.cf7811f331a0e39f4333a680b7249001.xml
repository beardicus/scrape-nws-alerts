<description>...LOCALIZED BLOWING AND DRIFTING SNOW.  ANOTHER ROUND OF MODERATE
TO HEAVY SNOW TODAY...
.Gusty southeast winds continues to cause blowing and drifting snow
across the Palouse, Pomeroy area, and the Camas Prairie this
morning.  The threat for blowing and drifting snow will expand north
and west toward Ritzville, Davenport, and Airway Heights this

possibly cause significant visibility reductions.
Moderate to heavy snow is falling across portions of Central and
Northern Washington and will spread from the Cascades into northeast
Washington and north Idaho by Monday morning.  Lighter snow
accumulations are expected across the Columbia Basin and
Spokane-Cd`A Area.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM PST THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Blowing and drifting snow. South winds of 20 to 40 mph with
localized gusts 45 to 65 mph.  1 to 2 inches of new snow possible
Monday afternoon.
* WHERE...Nezperce, Soldiers Meadow Road, Craigmont, Winchester, and
Kamiah.
* WHEN...Until 4 PM PST this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Localized whiteout conditions are expected and will make
travel treacherous and potentially life-threatening.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...High winds could also lead to downed power
lines and trees.
Some roads on the Camas Prairie may become closed from drifting
snow. Do not attempt to drive on roads that have been closed by
local authorities.</description>
<instruction>If travel is absolutely necessary, drive with extreme caution and be
prepared for sudden changes in visibility. Allow extra time to reach
your destination. Make sure your car is winterized and in good
working order.</instruction>
