as downed tree branches and weakened trees. The strongest winds
will be over Plumas County and eastern Shasta County above 4,000
feet where gusts up to 65+ mph will be possible, causing downed
trees and power lines. If you`re planning travel over the
mountains early this week, stay in touch with the latest
