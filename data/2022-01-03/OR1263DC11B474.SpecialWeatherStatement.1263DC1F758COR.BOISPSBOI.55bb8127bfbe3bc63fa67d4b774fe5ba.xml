<description>...SNOW SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE THUNDERSNOW WITH GUSTY WINDS AND THE
POTENTIAL FOR POOR VISIBILITY TONIGHT...
A strong winter weather system will move into the area tonight. A
rain/snow mix will change to all snow behind the front. Winds will
be strong both ahead of and behind the front, with gusts to 40 mph
possible. In addition, there is enough instability in the
atmosphere to support strong showers and even a thunderstorm.
Therefore we strongly urge caution if you are traveling in the
Treasure Valley between 8 PM MST and 4 AM MST. The earlier time
is when the Lower Treasure Valley sees the threat begin, with the
Upper Treasure threat starting around 10 PM MST. The threat ends
in the Lower Treasure Valley between 2 and 3 AM MST, and extends
through to 4 AM MST in the Upper Treasure Valley. There will be
brief periods of near-whiteout conditions in the stronger showers
or any thunderstorms that form, but most folks won`t experience
much worse than around 1/2 visibility with brief heavy snow and
gusts to 30 mph.</description>
