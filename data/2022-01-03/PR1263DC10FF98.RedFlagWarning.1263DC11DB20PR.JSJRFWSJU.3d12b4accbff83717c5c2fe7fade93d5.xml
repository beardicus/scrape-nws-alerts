<headline>Red Flag Warning issued January 03 at 12:38PM AST until January 03 at 6:00PM AST by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AST THIS EVENING FOR THE
SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH CENTRAL COASTAL PLAINS OF PUERTO RICO...
.Moderate winds with frequent strong gusts are being observed at
the Camp Santiago Station. The RH values have dipped into the mid
30s and is it possible for the RH to remain drier than normal
early this afternoon. In Addition, the fuel moisture is at 8
percent. Even though the observed sustained winds are slightly
weaker than the critical thresholds, and the fuel moisture is just
slightly higher, there will be frequent wind gusts and a very low
Relative Humidity is being observed. This will essentially cause
critical Fire Weather Conditions across the Southeast to South
Central Coastal Plains this afternoon.
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AST THIS EVENING FOR
THE SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH CENTRAL COASTAL PLAINS...
The National Weather Service in San Juan has issued a Red Flag
Warning, which is in effect until 6 PM AST this evening.

Southeast to South Central Coastal Plains.

afternoon.
* FUEL MOISTURE...Near or below thresholds. 10-hour fuel moisture
was observed near 8 percent.
* THUNDERSTORMS...None.
* IMPACTS...any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly.
Outdoor burning is not recommended.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now....or will shortly. A combination of
strong winds...low relative humidity...and warm temperatures can
contribute to extreme fire behavior.</instruction>
