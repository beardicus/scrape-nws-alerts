<description>...LOCALIZED BLOWING AND DRIFTING SNOW.  ANOTHER ROUND OF MODERATE
TO HEAVY SNOW TODAY...
.Gusty southeast winds continues to cause blowing and drifting snow
across the Palouse, Pomeroy area, and the Camas Prairie this
morning.  The threat for blowing and drifting snow will expand north
and west toward Ritzville, Davenport, and Airway Heights this
morning. Snow that is on the ground now will drift across roads and
possibly cause significant visibility reductions.
Moderate to heavy snow is falling across portions of Central and
Northern Washington and will spread from the Cascades into northeast
Washington and north Idaho by Monday morning.  Lighter snow
accumulations are expected across the Columbia Basin and
Spokane-Cd`A Area.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM PST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 2 and 3
inches. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph could result in blowing
and drifting snow.
* WHERE...Rockford, Spokane Valley, Worley, Coeur d`Alene, Cheney,
Fairfield, Hayden, Post Falls, Airway Heights, Downtown Spokane,
and Davenport.
* WHEN...Until 7 PM PST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Blowing snow will
reduce visibilities. The hazardous conditions could impact the
Monday morning and evening commutes.</description>
