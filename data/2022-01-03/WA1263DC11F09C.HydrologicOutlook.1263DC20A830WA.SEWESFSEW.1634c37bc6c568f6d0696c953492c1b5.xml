<description>...THREAT OF RIVER FLOODING TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY FOR PARTS
OF SOUTHWEST WASHINGTON...
Lower elevation river basins in southwest Washington could see
flooding as early as Tuesday night with chances stretching through
Sunday morning. Several bouts of precipitation will come through the
area during that time. There are many factors going into the chance
for flooding.
* Low elevation snow over the area
* low snow levels at the start of the the period, but a significant
rise in snow level during the first precipitation wave
* timing of warming compared to timing of the heaviest
precipitation; if the warmth doesn`t show up until after most of
the precip has occurred, the rivers are more likely to stay below
flood stage.
* how much lowland snow will still be on the ground and how much
will melt during the precip, with the potential for adding lowland
snowmelt to the storm runoff.
There is a potential for minor to moderate flooding is possible on
rivers such as the Skokomish, Newaukum, Chehalis, and Skookumchuck,
depending on the above factors. Or no flooding at all. A Flood
Potential Outlook means there is around a 30% to 50% chance of
flooding.
Please monitor the latest river forecasts from the National Weather
Service for additional information.</description>
