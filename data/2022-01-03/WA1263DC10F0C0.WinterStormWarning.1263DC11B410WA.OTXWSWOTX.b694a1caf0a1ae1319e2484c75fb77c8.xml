<description>...LOCALIZED BLOWING AND DRIFTING SNOW.  ANOTHER ROUND OF MODERATE

.Gusty southeast winds continues to cause blowing and drifting snow
across the Palouse, Pomeroy area, and the Camas Prairie this

possibly cause significant visibility reductions.

Northern Washington and will spread from the Cascades into northeast
Washington and north Idaho by Monday morning.  Lighter snow
accumulations are expected across the Columbia Basin and
Spokane-Cd`A Area.

Pass, Conconully, and Mazama.
* WHEN...Until 1 PM PST this afternoon.

likely become slick and hazardous. Plan on slippery road
conditions. Winter driving conditions are likely during the Monday
morning commute.</description>
