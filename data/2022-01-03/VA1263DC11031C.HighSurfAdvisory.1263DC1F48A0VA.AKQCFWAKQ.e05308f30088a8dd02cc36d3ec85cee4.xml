<description>...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT EST
TONIGHT...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 AM EST TUESDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, around two feet of
inundation above ground level expected in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways during high tide. For the High Surf Advisory,
large breaking waves of 6 to 10 feet expected in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Virginia Beach.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Warning, until midnight EST
tonight. For the High Surf Advisory, until 5 AM EST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Widespread flooding of vulnerable areas will result
in an elevated threat of property damage to homes and
businesses near the waterfront and shoreline. Water will be up
to 2 feet above ground level in some areas resulting in a
sufficient depth to close numerous roads and threaten homes
and businesses. Flooding will extend inland from the
waterfront along tidal rivers and bays resulting in some road
closures and flooding of vehicles. Significant beach and dune
erosion also expected near the coast.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
