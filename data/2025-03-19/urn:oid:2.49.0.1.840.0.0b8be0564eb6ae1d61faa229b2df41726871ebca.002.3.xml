        <headline>Rip Current Statement issued March 19 at 5:37PM AST until March 22 at 6:00AM AST by NWS San Juan PR</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...Breaking waves around 8 to 14 feet, and occasionally
higher, resulting in life-threatening rip currents, beach
erosion, and minor coastal flooding.

* WHERE...Beaches of western Puerto Rico. The most vulnerable
areas for high surf and beach erosion include Barrio Espinal in
Aguada.

* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk now through late Friday
night. For the High Surf Advisory from 6 AM Thursday to 6 PM AST
Friday. For the Coastal Flood Advisory from 6 AM Thursday to 6
AM AST Friday.

* IMPACTS...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, shallow flooding of
vulnerable areas will result in a limited threat of property and
structural damage near the waterfront and shoreline, with a
higher threat near the time of high tide. Isolated road closures
are possible. For the High Surf Advisory, high waves that can
wash over jetties and sweep people and pets onto jagged rocks.
Rough surf may also knock you down. Large breaking waves will
result in localized beach/dune structure erosion and dangerous
swimming conditions. For the High Rip Current Risk, rip currents
can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper
water, where it becomes difficult to return to safety.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Life-threatening rip currents will continue
across the north-facing beaches of the islands through most of
the week due to pulses of long period northerly swells.
However, a larger, northwesterly swell will arrive as early as
late tonight, building seas between 8 and 12 feet at 13 to 15
seconds. This will likely result in Coastal Flood and High Surf
Advisory conditions, particularly from the west-northwest to
northeast coast of Puerto Rico from Thursday through Friday. The
next high tides are expected as follows: In Aguadilla, at 11:35
AM AST Thursday at 0.35 feet and 1:02 AM AST Friday at 0.93
feet.

        <instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.

Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.

If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.

A Coastal Flood Advisory indicates that onshore winds and tides
will combine to generate flooding of low areas along the shore.

A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in
the advisory area, producing localized beach erosion and
dangerous swimming conditions.</instruction>
