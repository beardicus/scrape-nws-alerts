        <description>...WINTER STORM MOVING EAST ACROSS NORTHEASTERN COLORADO...

.A storm system that developed over eastern Colorado this afternoon
will move east into Nebraska and Kansas Wednesday morning. At
midnight, the heaviest snow was east of a line from Julesburg to
Akron to Limon with winds gusting in the 40 to 60 mph range
producing blizzard conditions over areas further east. West of that
line, snow was diminishing and additional accumulations will be
light. However, winds gusting in the 30 to 45 mph range will
continue to create significant blowing and drifting snow overnight.

As of midnight, highway closures included I-70 from just east of
Denver to Colby Kansas, and Colorado 86 and US 24 west of Limon.
I-25 between Castle Rock and Monument was also closed due to earlier
snow and accidents. Check www.cotrip.org or call 511 for updated
road conditions and closures.

* WHAT...Blizzard conditions expected. Total snow accumulations
between 1 and 4 inches, heaviest east of Akron and Limon. Winds
gusting as high as 60 mph.

* WHERE...Limon, and Akron.

* WHEN...Until 9 AM MDT Wednesday.

* IMPACTS...Travel is expected to become very difficult to
impossible due to heavy snowfall, drifting snow, and low
visibility. Visibility will be near zero at times resulting in
white out conditions. Conditions will improve from west to east
late tonight.

        <instruction>Alter your travel plans. Heavy snowfall, blowing snow, and poor
visibility are expected to make travel very difficult to impossible.
If travel is absolutely necessary, take a winter storm kit along
with you, including such items as tire chains, booster cables,
flashlight, shovel, blankets and extra clothing. Also take water, a
first aid kit, required medications, and anything else that would
help you survive in case you become stranded. If you become
stranded, stay with your vehicle and wait for help to arrive.

For the latest travel conditions from the Colorado Department of
Transportation, including road conditions, road closures, and
traction laws in effect, go to cotrip.org.</instruction>
