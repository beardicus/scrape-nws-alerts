<headline>Rip Current Statement issued November 15 at 9:54PM CST until November 17 at 6:00AM CST by NWS Mobile</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM CST
THURSDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM CST THURSDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE THURSDAY
NIGHT...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 5
to 8 feet in the surf zone. For the High Rip Current Risk,
dangerous rip currents. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor
coastal flooding expected.
* WHERE...In Alabama, Mobile Coastal and Baldwin Coastal
Counties. In Florida, Escambia Coastal, Santa Rosa Coastal and
Okaloosa Coastal Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 6 PM CST Thursday. For
the High Rip Current Risk, through late Thursday night. For the
Coastal Flood Advisory, until 6 AM CST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Minor coastal flooding will be most likely along the
western shores of area bays. This could result in minor
flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only isolated road
closures expected. High surf will cause dangerous swimming and
surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip currents
can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper
water.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as a few coastal roads
may be closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other waterside
infrastructure.</instruction>
