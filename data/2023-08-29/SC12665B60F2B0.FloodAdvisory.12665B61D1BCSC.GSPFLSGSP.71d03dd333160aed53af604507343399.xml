<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 29 at 12:44AM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 630 AM EDT THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of upstate South Carolina, including the
following counties, Greenville and Pickens.
* WHEN...Until 630 AM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks,
greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and
parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.
A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1235 AM EDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms
producing torrential rainfall from Table Rock State Park to
Dacusville to Marietta, with widespread 2-3 inches across the
Advisory area occurring within the past 60-90 minutes.  The
heaviest rainfall is departing the area, but excessive runoff
is just beginning, resulting in rapid rises on small streams.
Isolated areas of nuisance to Minor flooding are likely over
the next few hours.
Areas of greatest concern are along tributaries that feed the
South Saluda River below Table Rock Reservoir, including
along Beaverdam Creek near Dacusville Rd (SC 186), Carpenter
Creek near Dacusville Hwy (SC 135) and Shoals Creek Church
Rd, and the Middle Saluda River near N River Rd.
- Another 0.5 to 1 inch of rainfall is possible over the next
30-60 minutes as isolated thunderstorms continue over the
area before finally departing.  However. additional heavy
rainfall is possible later tonight.  Given saturated soils,
any new periods of heavy rainfall may cause new flood
concerns to develop quickly.  A Flash Flood Warning may be
issued.  Please stay weather aware and be prepared to seek
higher ground if you are in an area vulnerable to flooding.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Berea, Travelers Rest, Slater-Marietta, Pleasant Ridge State
Park, Caesars Head State Park, Table Rock State Park, Paris
Mountain State Park, Dacusville, Cleveland and Pumpkintown.

<instruction>Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
