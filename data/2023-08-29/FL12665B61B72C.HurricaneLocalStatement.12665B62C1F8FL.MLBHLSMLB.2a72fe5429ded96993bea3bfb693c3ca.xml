**Idalia Now A Hurricane, Accelerating Northward**
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Coastal Volusia,
Inland Northern Brevard, Inland Southern Brevard, Inland
Volusia, Mainland Northern Brevard, Mainland Southern Brevard,
Northern Brevard Barrier Islands, Northern Lake, Orange,
Osceola, Seminole, Southern Brevard Barrier Islands, and
Southern Lake
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 440 miles south-southwest of Leesburg FL
- 23.1N 85.0W
- Storm Intensity 75 mph
- Movement North or 360 degrees at 14 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
The center of Hurricane Idalia is located around 85 miles north of
the western tip of Cuba this morning. Idalia currently has maximum
sustained winds of 75 mph and is moving north at 14 mph. A continued
northward motion is expected today, followed by an accelerating
north-northeastward motion tonight into Wednesday. Idalia is forecast
to cross the Florida Gulf coast on Wednesday as a major hurricane.
Preparations should be nearing completion this morning ahead of local
tropical storm conditions by tonight and into Wednesday.
A Tropical Storm Warning remains in effect for Lake, Osceola, Orange,
Seminole, Volusia, and Brevard counties. For the Atlantic waters, a
Tropical Storm Warning remains in effect north of Sebastian Inlet.
Showers and squalls associated with outer rain bands from Idalia
should reach central Florida later today, with conditions
deteriorating further tonight and Wednesday as Idalia accelerates
north-northeastward across the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The possibility
of strong to damaging wind gusts in squalls will increase as tropical
storm force winds extend well east of the storm`s center. Based on the
current forecast track, Idalia will make its closest pass to
east-central Florida late tonight and early Wednesday morning,
continuing northeastward during the day on Wednesday. Wednesday will
be a windy day, even outside of squalls.
While the heaviest rainfall from Idalia is currently forecast to fall
along the Gulf Coast and western Florida Peninsula, gusty squalls will
be capable of torrential downpours, beginning today and continuing
into Wednesday. Around one to one and one-half inches of rain is
forecast for coastal areas and Okeechobee County from today through
Wednesday night, and two to four inches is forecast west of I-95 from
Brevard and Osceola Counties northward, with locally higher amounts
possible. Locations in closer proximity to the center of Idalia,
generally along and west of Interstate Four in east-central Florida,
may receive higher rainfall totals.
In addition to strong wind gusts, a threat for tornadoes is forecast
to develop this afternoon, continuing into Wednesday.
Incoming Atlantic swell from Major Hurricane Franklin, combined with
winds from Idalia, will lead to high seas, rough surf, an increase in
life-threatening rip currents, and beach erosion during high tides
today and Wednesday.
Do not let your guard down. Impacts from Idalia will be felt far from
the center of the storm. Now is the time to ensure your hurricane
supply kit is stocked and your safety plan is in place.
As Idalia becomes better organized today, additional changes to the
current forecast are possible. Any slight eastward adjustments in the
forecast track would increase the potential for local impacts, so
continue to monitor the latest forecasts from the National Hurricane
Center and National Weather Service in Melbourne, Florida.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
East Central Florida. Potential impacts include:
- Some damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Several large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible
significant impacts across portions of east central Florida. Potential
impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt evacuations and rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals, and
ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures are possible.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a dangerous tornado event having possible significant
impacts across east central Florida. Potential impacts
include:
- The occurrence of scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- Several places may experience tornado damage with a few spots
of considerable damage, power loss, and communications failures.
- Locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses, mobile
homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees snapped or
uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed about.
Dangerous projectiles can add to the toll.
* SURGE:
Direct surge impacts from Idalia are not currently anticipated at
this time. However, larger swells and surf combined with Hurricane
Franklin will bring a threat for minor coastal flooding and beach
erosion. Locations more vulnerable to coastal flooding and beach
erosion, such as portions of the Volusia and Brevard county coast,
should stay updated on the latest forecasts.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended actions.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
Keep cell phones well charged. Cell phone chargers for automobiles
can be helpful, but be aware of your risk for deadly carbon monoxide
poisoning if your car is left idling in a garage or other poorly
ventilated area.
If you are a visitor, be sure to know the name of the city or town in
which you are staying and the name of the county or parish in which
it resides. Listen for these locations in local news updates. Pay
attention for instructions from local authorities.
If a Tornado Warning is issued for your area, be ready to shelter
quickly, preferably away from windows and in an interior room not
prone to flooding. If driving, scan the roadside for quick shelter
options.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
