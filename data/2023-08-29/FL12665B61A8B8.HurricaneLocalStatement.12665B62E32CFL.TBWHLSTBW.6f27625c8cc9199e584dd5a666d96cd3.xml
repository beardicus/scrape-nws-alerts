SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Idalia is starting to lift north off of western Cuba this
morning. Idalia is forecast to continue moving north and eventually
northeast across the eastern Gulf of Mexico through Wednesday, and
intensifying into a major hurricane. Watches and Warnings remain in
effect for West Central and Southwest Florida and the adjacent coastal
waters.
The following are the primary hazards of concern with Idalia:
* Storm Surge - Areas across the Nature Coast are forecast to see
extreme life-threatening levels of storm surge, with life- threatening
surge also possible across west-central Florida. The main period of
surge looks to occur late this afternoon through early Thursday. Storm
surge inundation could reach 8 to 12 feet along the Levy and Citrus
county coastlines, 6 to 9 feet along the Hernando and Pasco county
coastlines, 4 to 7 feet for the Pinellas, Hillsborough, and Manatee
county coastlines, 3 to 5 feet along the Sarasota county coast, and
2 to 4 feet along Charlotte and Lee counties.
* Wind - Winds will start to increase through the day today, with
hurricane force winds possible across much of the area, especially
near the coast. Tropical storm force winds will be possible across the
southern zones. Rush to completion any preparedness activities this
morning. Downed trees and powerlines, with prolonged power outages
will be possible.
* Rainfall - Rain bands from Idalia will lift over the area today as
the storm approaches, with the more consistent tropical rains with the
storm possible later today through Wednesday. A slight to moderate
risk for flooding is possible, mainly along the coast and across the
northern zones, closer to the center of the storm. Rainfall totals of
4 to 8 inches with locally higher amounts up to 12 inches is possible.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Protect against life-threatening surge having possible devastating
impacts across west central and southwest Florida. Potential impacts
in this area include:
- Widespread deep inundation, with storm surge flooding greatly
accentuated by powerful battering waves. Structural damage to
buildings, with many washing away. Damage greatly compounded
from considerable floating debris. Locations may be
uninhabitable for an extended period.
- Near-shore escape routes and secondary roads washed out or
severely flooded. Flood control systems and barriers may become
stressed.
- Extreme beach erosion. New shoreline cuts possible.
- Massive damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Numerous small craft broken away from moorings with many lifted
onshore and stranded.
* WIND:
Protect against life-threatening wind having possible devastating
impacts across west central and southwest Florida. Potential impacts
in this area include:
- Structural damage to sturdy buildings, some with complete roof
and wall failures. Complete destruction of mobile homes. Damage
greatly accentuated by large airborne projectiles. Locations
may be uninhabitable for weeks or months.
- Numerous large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and
roadway signs blown over.
- Many roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. Many bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Widespread power and communications outages.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across west central and southwest Florida.
Potential impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may
become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and barriers may
become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.
Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with
underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.
Many road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a dangerous tornado event having possible significant
impacts across west central and southwest Florida. Potential impacts
include:
- The occurrence of scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- Several places may experience tornado damage with a few spots
of considerable damage, power loss, and communications failures.
- Locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses, mobile
homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees snapped or
uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and boats tossed about. Dangerous
projectiles can add to the toll.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local officials for recommended preparedness actions.
If ordered to evacuate, do so immediately.
For those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,
falling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move,
relocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help
keep roadways open for those under evacuation orders.
If evacuating, leave with a destination in mind and allow extra time
to get there. Take your emergency supplies kit. Gas up your vehicle
ahead of time.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
If heading to a community shelter, become familiar with the shelter
rules before arrival, especially if you have special needs or have
pets. Take essential items with you from your Emergency Supplies Kit.
Failure to adequately shelter may result in serious injury or loss of
life. Always heed the advice of local officials and comply with any
orders that are issued. Remember, during the storm 9 1 1 Emergency
Services may not be able to immediately respond if conditions are
unsafe. This should be a big factor in your decision making.
Storm surge is the leading killer associated with tropical storms and
hurricanes! Make sure you are in a safe area away from the surge
zone. Even if you are not in a surge-prone area, you could find
yourself cutoff by flood waters during and after the storm. Heed
evacuation orders issued by the local authorities.
