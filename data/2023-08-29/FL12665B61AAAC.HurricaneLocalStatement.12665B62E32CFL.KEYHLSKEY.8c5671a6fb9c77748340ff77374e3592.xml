- A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Monroe Lower Keys

SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Idalia is now a hurricane and continues to strengthen in the far
southeastern Gulf of Mexico. There have been no changes to Florida Keys
watches and warnings, with a Tropical Storm Warning remaining in
effect for the Dry Tortugas and a Tropical Storm Watch for the Lower
Keys. Idalia will continue to accelerate to the north today, then to
the north to northeast later today into Wednesday. The confidence in
the track forecast is quite high for the next 24 hours as it treks
northward, followed by some uncertainty regarding an expected turn to
the northeast and towards Florida`s Big Bend region. At its closest
point of approach, the center of Idalia will pass well to the west of
the Florida Keys during the day today. Winds in the Keys will continue
to strengthen gradually through the morning and early afternoon hours,
peaking this afternoon. Tropical Storm-force wind gusts will be
possible, particularly along and west of the Lower Keys, and during
occasional thundery squalls. Convective banding continues to advance
eastward across the western half of the forecast area, with individual
cells moving northward at around 50 mph. The persistent southerly
winds, along with King tides, may result in coastal flooding of around
2 feet above normal high tides. In addition, rainfall of 1 to 3 inches,
with locally higher amounts, and a tornado or two cannot be ruled out.
Conditions are expected to gradually improve tonight into Wednesday,
although strong southerly breezes will persist through much of the day
on Wednesday.
No evacuations have been ordered. Monroe County and City of Key West
report facilities and services will remain open. Medical services and
The Key West International Airport will remain open. For further

POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across the
Florida Keys. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across the Florida Keys, little to no impact is anticipated.
* SURGE:
Prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited impacts
across the Florida Keys. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of roads and parking lots inundated by surge water.
Driving conditions dangerous in places where surge water covers
the road.
- Moderate beach erosion.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
Elsewhere across the Florida Keys, little to no impact is anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across the Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.
- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually
vulnerable spots.
* TORNADOES:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time across the Florida
Keys.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
If you are exceptionally vulnerable to wind or water hazards from
tropical systems, consider voluntary evacuation, especially if being
officially recommended. Relocate to a predetermined shelter or safe
destination.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging wind
gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the center of
the storm.
When securing your property, outside preparations should be concluded
as soon as possible before conditions deteriorate. The onset of strong
gusty winds or flooding can cause certain preparedness activities to
become unsafe.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news outlets
for official storm information. Listen for possible changes to the
forecast.
There is a threat from tornadoes with this storm. Have multiple ways
to receive Tornado Warnings. Be ready to shelter quickly.
