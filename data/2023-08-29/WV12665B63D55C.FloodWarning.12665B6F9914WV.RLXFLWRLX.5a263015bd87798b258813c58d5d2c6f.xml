<description>...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 130 AM EDT WEDNESDAY...
...REPLACES FLASH FLOOD WARNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of northern West Virginia, including the
following county, Harrison.
* WHEN...Until 130 AM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring. Numerous roads
remain closed due to flooding. Low-water crossings are inundated
with water and may not be passable. Expect many areas of slow
moving or standing water. It will take several hours for all the
water from these storms to work through local drainage systems in
urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 733 PM EDT, local law enforcement reported heavy rain in
the warned area due to thunderstorms. Flooding is already
occurring. Between 1 and 2.5 inches of rain have fallen.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 0.5 to 1 inch are possible in
the warned area.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Clarksburg, Bridgeport, Shinnston, Stonewood, Nutter Fort,
Anmoore, West Milford, Lost Creek and Despard.

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Report flooding to the National Weather Service by calling toll
free, 800 401 9535, when you can do so safely.</instruction>
