<description>...TROPICAL STORM WARNING IN EFFECT...
A Tropical Storm Warning means tropical storm-force winds are
expected somewhere within this area within the next 36 hours
* LOCATIONS AFFECTED
- Surfside Beach
- Myrtle Beach
- North Myrtle Beach
* WIND
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Equivalent Tropical Storm force wind
- Peak Wind Forecast: 30-40 mph with gusts to 50 mph
- Window for Tropical Storm force winds: Wednesday evening
until Thursday morning
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for wind 58
to 73 mph
- The wind threat has remained nearly steady from the
previous assessment.
- PLAN: Plan for dangerous wind of equivalent strong tropical
storm force.
- PREPARE: Remaining efforts to protect life and property
should be completed as soon as possible. Prepare for
significant wind damage.
- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant
- Some damage to roofing and siding, along with damage to
porches and awnings. A few buildings experiencing window,
door, and garage door failures. Damage to vulnerable
structures such as carports, sheds and mobile homes is
possible.
- Large limbs will be down with several trees snapped or
uprooted. Several fences and roadway signs may become blown
over. Some roads may become impassable due to large debris
blocking the roadway, especially within urban or heavily
wooded locations. Some bridges, causeways, and elevated
roads may be impacted by high winds making driving on them
hazardous.
- Scattered power and communications outages are possible,
but more prevalent in areas with above ground lines.
- Small craft that are not properly moored may break loose.
* STORM SURGE
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Localized storm surge possible
- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 1-3 feet
above ground somewhere within surge prone areas
- Window of concern: Wednesday afternoon until early Thursday
morning
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm
surge flooding greater than 1 foot above ground
- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the
previous assessment.
- PLAN: Plan for storm surge flooding greater than 1 foot
above ground.
- PREPARE: Complete preparations for storm surge flooding,
especially in low-lying vulnerable areas, before conditions
become unsafe.
- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for
your area.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited
- Localized inundation and minor over-wash is possible,
mainly along immediate shorelines and other vulnerable
low-lying areas along the coast. Low spots along waterways
and tidal creeks may also be impacted.
- Some portions of near-shore roads and parking lots may
become covered by surge water. Driving conditions may
become hazardous in places where the surge covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion is possible, mainly in the
vulnerable locations along the ocean front.
- Minor damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers is
possible. A few small craft may break away from moorings if
not properly secured.
- Navigation may be difficult near inlets and waterways, as
navigational aids may be off station or missing.
* FLOODING RAIN
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Flood Watch is in effect
- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 3-6 inches, with locally
higher amounts
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for major
flooding rain
- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from
the previous assessment.
- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for
major flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues are
likely.
- PREPARE: Strongly consider protective actions, especially
if you are in an area vulnerable to flooding.
- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take
action will likely result in serious injury or loss of life.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive
- Major flooding from rainfall may prompt evacuations and
numerous rescues.
- Rivers and streams may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Creeks and ditches will flood and may
contain strong currents.
- Flood waters may enter many structures, and some may become
uninhabitable. Some road scours or complete road failures
will be possible, along with the potential for sinkholes.
Many streets and parking lots may flood, and may be
impacted by flowing water. Many road and low-lying bridge
closures are possible with some weakened or washed away.
Driving conditions will be dangerous.
- The delivery of drinking water and sewer services may be
interrupted. Flood waters may be polluted and contain
hazardous materials.
* TORNADO
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:
- Situation is favorable for tornadoes
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for several
tornadoes
- The tornado threat has remained nearly steady from the
previous assessment.
- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for
several tornadoes with a few possibly intense having larger
damage paths.
- PREPARE: Those living in manufactured homes or on boats are
urged to relocate to safe shelter before hazardous weather
arrives.
- ACT: Listen for tornado watches and warnings. If a tornado
warning is issued, be ready to shelter quickly.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant
- The occurrence of scattered tornadoes can hinder
preparedness actions during tropical events.
- Tornadoes can rip roofs from homes, destroy mobile homes,
cause trees to become snapped or uprooted, flip cars and
boats. Dangerous projectiles can add to the damage.
- Several places may experience tornado damage with a few
spots of considerable damage, power loss, and
communications failures.
