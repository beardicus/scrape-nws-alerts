**Hurricane Idalia Continues to Strengthen As It Moves North**
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- The Tropical Storm Watch has been cancelled for Inland Collier
County
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Coastal Collier County
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 200 miles west-northwest of Naples FL
- 27.7N 84.5W
- Storm Intensity 110 mph
- Movement North or 10 degrees at 18 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Idalia is moving northward across the eastern Gulf of
Mexico this evening and will approach the Big Bend region of Florida
early Wednesday. It is then expected to move northeastward across
northern Florida and towards the Georgia and Carolinas coast by late
Wednesday into early Thursday.
The following are the primary hazards of concern with Idalia:
* Coastal Flooding/Surge - Higher than usual tides due to the
combination of surge from Idalia and the upcoming full moon could lead
to coastal flooding of 1 to 3 feet along coastal Collier and mainland
Monroe Counties. Other vulnerable coastal areas of southern Florida
could also experience minor coastal flooding, especially around the
times of high tide.
* Rainfall - The majority of the rainfall associated with the system
is forecast to fall through Wednesday. Additional rain amounts of 1 to
3 inches with localized higher amounts are possible. The highest
amounts are anticipated along the Gulf coast.
* Wind - Gusty southerly winds continue across South Florida. Tropical
storm force winds remain possible along the Collier County coast. The
remainder of South Florida could see winds gusts up to 35mph, with the
highest gusts likely during the day on Wednesday.
* Tornadoes - A low-end tornado threat is possible through Wednesday,
mainly across the lake Okeechobee region.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
Coastal Collier County. Remain well sheltered from hazardous
wind having possible limited impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact is anticipated.
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across
Coastal Collier and Mainland Monroe counties. Remain well away from
locally hazardous surge having possible limited impacts. If realized,
these impacts include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread
with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where
surge water covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
Elsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact is anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
South Florida. Remain well guarded against locally hazardous flood
waters having additional limited impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.
- Ditches and canals may quickly rise with swift currents.
- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually
vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding of water
occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become
near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge
closures.
* TORNADOES:
Potential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across the Lake
Okeechobee region. Remain well braced against a tornado event
having possible limited impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, mobile
homes pushed off foundations or overturned, large tree tops and
branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving
vehicles blown off roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.
Elsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to stay inside and away from windows. Listen for
updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Keep a
battery-powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.
Keep your cell phone charged and in power-saving mode. If you lose
power, use it sparingly and mainly for personal emergencies and
check-ins.
If a tornado warning is issued for your area, quickly move to the
safest place within your shelter. Protect your head and body.
