SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Idalia is forecast to track northward across the eastern
Gulf of Mexico while strengthening through today and tonight before
making as a major hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida
Wednesday morning. After making landfall, Idalia is expected to track
over southeast Georgia Wednesday evening.
Local impacts from Idalia will begin as early as Wednesday morning as
heavy rainfall begins to overspread southeast central Georgia from
southwest to northeast. Heavy rainfall will then continue through
Wednesday night across the region with 4 to 8 inches of rainfall
forecast, with locally greater amounts possible. Tropical Storm force
winds are expected to occur across southeast central Georgia on
Wednesday morning into Wednesday evening. Tornadoes will be possible
across southeast central GA Wednesday afternoon and Wednesday night,
particularly in tropical bands.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across southeast central Georgia. Potential impacts
include:
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, arroyos, and
ditches may become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and
barriers may become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable. Many places
where flood waters may cover escape routes. Streets and parking
lots become rivers of moving water with underpasses submerged.
Driving conditions become dangerous. Many road and bridge
closures with some weakened or washed out.
Prepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible limited to
significant impacts across southeast central Georgia.
* WIND:
Prepare for dangerous wind having possible significant impacts across
southeast central Georgia. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
Also, prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts
across southeast central Georgia.
Elsewhere across NORTH AND CENTRAL GEORGIA, little to no impact is
anticipated.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a dangerous tornado event having possible significant
impacts across southeast central Georgia. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- Several places may experience tornado damage with a few spots
of considerable damage, power loss, and communications failures.
- Locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses, mobile
homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees snapped or
uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed about.
Dangerous projectiles can add to the toll.
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
southeast central Georgia.
Elsewhere across NORTH AND CENTRAL GEORGIA, little to no impact is
anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies
kit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your
home or business.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
Always heed the advice of local officials and comply with orders that
are issued. Do not needlessly jeopardize your life or the lives of
others.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes
to the forecast.
