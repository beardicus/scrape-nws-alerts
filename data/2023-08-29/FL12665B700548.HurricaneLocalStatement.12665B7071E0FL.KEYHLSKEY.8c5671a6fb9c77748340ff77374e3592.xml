SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Idalia continues to strengthen while moving northward in the
eastern Gulf of Mexico, and is now a Category Two hurricane. With the
threat for sustained tropical storm force winds having ended for the
Florida Keys and the Dry Tortugas, all tropical storm watches and
warnings have been discontinued.
Strong southerly winds will continue overnight into Wednesday morning
over the Lower Keys, with sustained wind speeds of 20 to 30 mph and
peak gusts of 35 to 40 mph expected. A Wind Advisory has been issued
for the Lower Keys through Wednesday morning.
The persistent and strong southerly winds, along with King tides, will
likely continue to cause coastal flooding up to around 2 feet above
normal high tides, with the greatest threat across the Lower Keys
during the high tide on Wednesday morning. A Coastal Flood Warning
remains in effect for the Lower Keys, with a Coastal Flood Advisory
for the Middle Keys, and a Coastal Flood Statement for the Upper Keys.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Little to no additional impacts are anticipated at this time across
the Florida Keys.
* SURGE:
Surge impacts will continue across the Lower Florida Keys through the
Wednesday morning high tide cycle. Remain well away from locally
hazardous surge having additional limited impacts. These impacts
include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of roads and parking lots inundated by surge water.
Driving conditions dangerous in places where surge water covers
the road.
- Moderate beach erosion.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.

Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time across the Florida
Keys.
