<headline>Red Flag Warning issued August 29 at 2:53PM MDT until August 30 at 1:00AM MDT by NWS Glasgow</headline>
<description>.Stronger winds will be funneled between competing pressure
systems over our region this afternoon through Wednesday. The

the northwest this evening. Around midnight, humidity will recover
and winds will diminish slightly ahead of the approaching cold
front.
