<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 29 at 4:21PM AKDT  by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON AKDT FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...Tanana River from Delta Junction to Fairbanks
* WHEN...Until noon AKDT Friday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding is occurring in low lying areas along the
Tanana River from Delta Junction to Fairbanks and further
downriver. In Fairbanks, several inches of water is flowing over
the Melanie Lane and Chief John Drive and going overbank nearby at
Perkins Landing. Several driveways and yards are inundated with
water. Minor flooding is also possible at the boat landing at
Whitestone Farms near Delta Junction. Minor flooding or bankfull
conditions are expected through Friday.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 400 PM AKDT, heavy rain that fell over the south slopes of
the Alaska Range from Denali to Isabel Pass the past several
days has caused high water to flow down the Delta River and
other rivers draining the Alaska Range. This has caused the
Tanana River to rise to bankfull and overbank in some
locations. More rain is expected in the Alaska Range the next
few days and water levels will remain high.
- For Tanana River at Big Delta:
At 3:00pm Tue the stage was 22.8 feet.
Flood Stage is 23.0 feet.
Forecast crest around 23.5 feet is expected around 10:00pm
Thursday.
For Tanana River at Fairbanks:
At 3:00am Tue the stage was 25.1 feet.
Flood Stage is 24.5 feet.
Forecast: The river is expected to remain steady at this
level into Friday.
