SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Idalia has emerged over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico
and is forecast to rapidly strengthen and accelerate north-
northeastward towards the Florida Big Bend coast tonight. Idalia is
expected to make landfall at Category 3 hurricane intensity early on
Wednesday morning, and the hurricane should then turn northeastward
across our area through Wednesday evening. Idalia may maintain
hurricane intensity as it traverses portions of inland southeast
Georgia on Wednesday afternoon, but should weaken to tropical storm
intensity as it crosses the Altamaha River towards sunset on
Wednesday.
Local impacts from Idalia will begin this evening, as spiral rain
bands begin to overspread our region from southwest to northeast.
Heavy rainfall will then continue Wednesday evening. Tornadoes will be
possible across the area on Tuesday night and Wednesday, with higher
chances expected for locations along and east of the U.S. Highway
301 corridor. Sustained tropical storm force winds will begin to be
felt across north central Florida and the Suwannee Valley during the
predawn hours on Wednesday, with conditions deteriorating quickly
after sunrise, when hurricane force wind gusts will be possible.
Sustained hurricane force winds are expected near the core of Idalia
in the Suwannee Valley through the early the mid afternoon hours, with
hurricane force gusts possible elsewhere along the Interstate
75 corridor. Sustained tropical storm force winds will be possible
elsewhere in our area on Wednesday. Storm surge potential will
increase on Wednesday, especially along the southeast Georgia coast,
where life threatening inundation of greater than 3 feet above ground
level is possible.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Protect against life-threatening wind having possible devastating
impacts for locations in western and northern portions of the Suwannee
Valley and portions of inland southeast Georgia from Blackshear
southwestward through Waycross, Homerville, and Statenville.
Potential impacts in these areas include:
- Structural damage to sturdy buildings, some with complete roof
and wall failures. Complete destruction of mobile homes. Damage
greatly accentuated by large airborne projectiles. Locations
may be uninhabitable for weeks or months.
- Numerous large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and
roadway signs blown over.
- Many roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. Many bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Widespread power and communications outages.
Also, protect against life-threatening wind having possible limited
to extensive impacts across coastal southeast Georgia.
* SURGE:
Protect against life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across coastal southeast Georgia. Potential impacts in
this area include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
Also, protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across coastal northeast Florida and within the St. Johns River
basin.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a dangerous tornado event having possible significant
impacts across Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia. Potential
impacts include:
- The occurrence of scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- Several places may experience tornado damage with a few spots
of considerable damage, power loss, and communications failures.
- Locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses, mobile
homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees snapped or
uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed about.
Dangerous projectiles can add to the toll.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across southeast Georgia and the Suwannee Valley
of north Florida.
Potential impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may
become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and barriers may
become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.
Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with
underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.
Many road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible limited
to significant impacts across northeast and north central Florida.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
For those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,
falling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move,
relocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help
keep roadways open for those under evacuation orders.
If evacuating, leave with a destination in mind and allow extra
time to get there. Take your emergency supplies kit. Gas up your
vehicle ahead of time.
Let others know where you are going prior to departure. Secure
loose items and pets in the car, and avoid distracted driving.
If evacuating, follow designated evacuation routes. Seek traffic
information on roadway signs, the radio, and from official sources.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
If you are relocating to safe shelter, leave as early as possible.
Allow extra time to reach your destination. Many roads and bridges
will be closed once strong winds arrive. Check the latest weather
forecast before departing and drive with caution.
If heading to a community shelter, become familiar with the shelter
rules before arrival, especially if you have special needs or have
pets. Take essential items with you from your Emergency Supplies Kit.
Failure to adequately shelter may result in serious injury or loss of
life. Always heed the advice of local officials and comply with any
orders that are issued. Remember, during the storm 9 1 1 Emergency
Services may not be able to immediately respond if conditions are
unsafe. This should be a big factor in your decision making.
Keep cell phones well charged. Cell phone chargers for automobiles
can be helpful, but be aware of your risk for deadly carbon monoxide
poisoning if your car is left idling in a garage or other poorly
ventilated area.
It is important to remain calm, informed, and focused during an
emergency. Be patient and helpful with those you encounter.
If you are a visitor, be sure to know the name of the city or town in
which you are staying and the name of the county or parish in which
it resides. Listen for these locations in local news updates. Pay
attention for instructions from local authorities.
Storm surge is the leading killer associated with tropical storms and
hurricanes! Make sure you are in a safe area away from the surge
zone. Even if you are not in a surge-prone area, you could find
yourself cutoff by flood waters during and after the storm. Heed
evacuation orders issued by the local authorities.
Rapidly rising flood waters are deadly. If you are in a flood-prone
area, consider moving to higher ground. Never drive through a flooded
roadway. Remember, turn around don`t drown!
If a Tornado Warning is issued for your area, be ready to shelter
quickly, preferably away from windows and in an interior room not
prone to flooding. If driving, scan the roadside for quick shelter
options.
If in a place that is vulnerable to high wind, such as near large
trees, a manufactured home, upper floors of a high-rise building, or
on a boat, consider moving to a safer shelter before the onset of
strong winds or flooding.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
