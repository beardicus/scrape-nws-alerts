**Hurricane Idalia Continues to Strengthen As It Moves North**
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- The Storm Surge Watch has been cancelled for Coastal Collier
County
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Coastal Collier County
- A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Inland Collier County
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 290 miles west of Miami FL or about 190 miles west of
Naples FL
- 26.1N 84.8W
- Storm Intensity 100 mph
- Movement North or 360 degrees at 16 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Idalia is moving northward through the southeastern Gulf
of Mexico this afternoon. Idalia is forecast to continue
strengthening as it moves north, and eventually northeast, across
the eastern Gulf of Mexico through Wednesday.
The following are the primary hazards of concern with Idalia:
* Coastal Flooding/Surge - Higher than usual tides due to the
combination of surge from Idalia and the upcoming full moon could
lead to coastal flooding of 1 to 3 feet along coastal Collier and
mainland Monroe Counties. Other vulnerable coastal areas of
southern Florida could also experience minor coastal flooding,
especially around the times of high tide.
* Rainfall - The majority of the rainfall associated with the system
is forecast to fall through Wednesday. The greatest risk for flash
flooding will be near the Gulf coast. Storm total rain amounts of
2 to 3 inches with localized higher amounts. The highest amounts
are anticipated along the Gulf coast.
* Wind - Increasingly gusty winds are overspreading the region,
particularly along the Gulf coast and adjacent coastal waters. A
reasonable worst case scenario would have tropical storm force
winds across Collier County between now and Wednesday. The
remainder of South Florida could see winds gusts up to 35mph, with
the highest gusts likely during the day on Wednesday.
* Tornadoes - A low-end tornado threat is possible through Wednesday
as bands from the system move ashore.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across
Coastal Collier County. Remain well away from locally hazardous
surge having possible limited impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread
with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where
surge water covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
Elsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact is anticipated.
* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
Southwest Florida. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact is anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
South Florida. Remain well guarded against locally hazardous flood
waters having additional limited impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.
- Ditches and canals may quickly rise with swift currents.
- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually
vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding of water
occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become
near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge
closures.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
South Florida. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, mobile
homes pushed off foundations or overturned, large tree tops and
branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving
vehicles blown off roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to stay inside and away from windows. Listen for
updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Keep a
battery-powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.
During the peak of the storm be ready to move quickly. Keep your
shoes on and rain gear handy. Boots and athletic shoes offer the best
foot protection if you become unexpectedly exposed to the weather.
Keep your cell phone charged and in power-saving mode. If you lose
power, use it sparingly and mainly for personal emergencies and
check-ins.
Do not be a thrill seeker or risk your life for senseless photos or
videos.
If you are prone to flooding or in an area under a storm surge watch
or warning, be prepared for the possibility of a quick and dramatic
rise in water levels.
If a tornado warning is issued for your area, quickly move to the
safest place within your shelter. Protect your head and body.
