<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued August 29 at 4:19AM EDT until August 29 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM EDT
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents
and large breaking waves expected in the surf zone. For the High
Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 5 to 8 feet building to 7
to 11 feet expected in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Hatteras Island beaches, and Core Banks beaches.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, through this evening.
For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 AM EDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Localized ocean overwash will be
possible between Oregon Inlet and Cape Lookout, and may impact
portions of NC-12 during times of high tide at 6:00 AM and 7:00
PM Tuesday. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw a
swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom causing neck and
back injuries.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most likely time for strong rip
currents to occur is a couple hours either side of low tide,
which will occur around 12:25 PM Tuesday.</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
