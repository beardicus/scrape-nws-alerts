<description>...STORM SURGE WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT...
...TROPICAL STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT...
* LOCATIONS AFFECTED
- Hilton Head Island
- Beaufort
- Bluffton
* WIND
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Equivalent Tropical Storm force wind
- Peak Wind Forecast: 45-55 mph with gusts to 65 mph
- Window for Tropical Storm force winds: Wednesday afternoon
until early Thursday morning
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for wind 74
to 110 mph
- The wind threat has remained nearly steady from the
previous assessment.
- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening wind of equivalent CAT 1 or
2 hurricane force.
- PREPARE: Remaining efforts to protect life and property
should be urgently completed. Prepare for considerable wind
damage.
- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive
- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some
window, door, and garage door failures leading to
structural damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some
destroyed. Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Some
locations may be uninhabitable for weeks.
- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne
projectiles outside.
- Large trees snapped or uprooted.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within
urban or heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and
access routes impassable.
- Large areas with power and communications outages, which
could persist for days.
- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.
* STORM SURGE
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible
- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 2-4 feet
above ground somewhere within surge prone areas
- Window of concern: Wednesday afternoon until early Thursday
morning
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm
surge flooding greater than 3 feet above ground
- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the
previous assessment.
- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of
greater than 3 feet above ground.
- PREPARE: Evacuation efforts and flood preparations should
soon be brought to completion before conditions become
unsafe.
- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for
your area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or
needlessly risk lives.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant
- Areas of inundation of saltwater along immediate shorelines
and in low-lying spots farther inland near rivers and
creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by waves.
Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads
become weakened or washed out, especially in normally
vulnerable low spots.
- Moderate to major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching
dunes. Strong and numerous rip currents.
- Minor to moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and
piers. Several small craft broken away from moorings,
especially in unprotected anchorages. Some navigation aids
possibly displaced well off station, creating difficult
navigation near inlets and waterways.
* FLOODING RAIN
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Flood Watch is in effect
- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 3-6 inches, with locally
higher amounts
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for major
flooding rain
- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from
the previous assessment.
- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for
major flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues are
likely.
- PREPARE: Strongly consider protective actions, especially
if you are in an area vulnerable to flooding.
- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take
action will likely result in serious injury or loss of life.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive
- Major rainfall flooding could prompt many rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries could rapidly overflow their banks
in multiple locations. Small streams, creeks, canals,
ditches may become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems
and barriers could become stressed.
- Flood waters could enter many structures within multiple
communities; some structures become uninhabitable or are
washed away. Flood waters could cover multiple escape
routes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving
water with underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become
dangerous. Many road and bridge closures with some weakened
or washed out.
- Drinking water and sewer services could be negatively
impacted.
- Hazardous containers and materials could possibly be
present in flood waters.
* TORNADO
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:
- Situation is favorable for tornadoes
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for several
tornadoes
- The tornado threat has increased from the previous
assessment.
- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for
several tornadoes with a few possibly intense having larger
damage paths.
- PREPARE: Those living in manufactured homes or on boats are
urged to relocate to safe shelter before hazardous weather
arrives.
- ACT: Listen for tornado watches and warnings. If a tornado
warning is issued, be ready to shelter quickly.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant
- Isolated to scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution of
emergency plans.
- Scattered locations could experience enhanced damage due to
tornadoes with a few spots of considerable damage, power
loss, and communications failures.
- Scattered locations could realize roofs torn off frame
houses, mobile homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large
trees snapped or uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and small
boats tossed about.
