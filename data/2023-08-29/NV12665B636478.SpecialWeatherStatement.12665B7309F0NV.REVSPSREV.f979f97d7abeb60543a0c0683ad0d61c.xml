<description>...Cool and windy with rain showers for Labor Day Weekend...
An anomalously cold early season storm will drop into the region
just in time for the holiday weekend. Here`s what you need to
know...
WINDS:
Southwest wind gusts 30-45 mph should be expected Thursday and
Friday, with gusts peaking Thursday night on Sierra ridgelines at
60-80 mph. Wind prone valley locations will remain breezy Thursday
night as well. Winds of this magnitude will cause problems for
outdoor recreation, including rough lake waters for smaller
watercraft such as kayaks or paddle boards and blowing dust on
and downwind of desert playas. The air will be turbulent for
aviators as well, especially smaller aircraft and gliders.
TEMPERATURES:
High temperatures will fall to 10-20 degrees below normal, with
the coldest days being Saturday and Sunday when the warmest of
valleys may only reach the low 70s. Colder Sierra valleys may see
low temperatures near the freezing mark by Sunday or Monday
morning.
RAIN SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORM POTENTIAL:
Rain showers will develop for portions of northeast CA, northern
NV, nearing the Tahoe Basin on Friday, spreading south across the
region Saturday and Sunday. A few embedded thunderstorms are also
possible, a 10-20% chance. Showers may occur at any point during
the day or night throughout the weekend, beginning to clear out of
the region for Labor Day. In the cold air mass, snow levels could
fall as low as 9.5-10 kft.
BOTTOM LINE:
If you have outdoor recreation plans this holiday weekend, be
sure that you are prepared for the cold, wet, and windy
conditions. It`s going to be quite the change from last year when
we were dealing with record breaking heat over Labor Day Weekend!</description>
