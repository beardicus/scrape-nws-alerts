<headline>Flood Watch issued August 29 at 6:36AM AKDT  by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...The Upper Kobuk and Noatak Valleys and Upper Koyukuk
Valley from Bettles west.
* WHEN...Through Wednesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff from heavy rain may result in flooding
of streams and rivers and other low-lying and flood-prone
locations. At this time, flooding of the mainstem of the Koyukuk,
Noatak and Kobuk Rivers is not expected, but those rivers will see
sharp rises this week with water overbank in some low lying
locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The 2 to 4 inches of rain that fell the past 5 days over the
Koyukuk Basin from the Dalton Highway West, and over the
Kobuk and Upper Noatak Basins, has now worked its way
downstream through tributaries and is working its way into
the mainstream of these rivers. Another half inch of rain is
expected over this area through Wednesday night. Expect
streams and small rivers to remain high today, while the
mainstem of these rivers rise over the next several days and
may reach near bankfull.
More heavy rain coming late this week with the remains of
Tropical Storm Damrey could cause further high water this
weekend.

Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
