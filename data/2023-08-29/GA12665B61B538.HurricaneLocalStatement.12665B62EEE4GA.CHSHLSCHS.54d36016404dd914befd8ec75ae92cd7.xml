SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Idalia is forecast to track northward across the eastern
Gulf of Mexico while strengthening through today and tonight. Idalia
is forecast to make landfall as a major hurricane in the Big Bend
region of Florida Wednesday morning. After making landfall, Idalia is
expected to track over southeast Georgia and just inland of the
southeast South Carolina coastline Wednesday evening through early
Thursday morning.
Local impacts from Idalia will begin as early as Wednesday morning as
heavy rainfall begins to overspread southeast Georgia and southeast
South Carolina from southwest to northeast. Heavy rainfall will then
continue through Wednesday night across the region with 4 to 8 inches
of rainfall forecast, with locally greater amounts possible. Tropical
Storm force winds are expected to occur across the southeast Georgia
on Wednesday morning with conditions deteriorating Wednesday afternoon
and into Wednesday night as Tropical Storm force winds spread up the
coast and into portions of southeast South Carolina. Tornadoes will be
possible across the area Wednesday afternoon and Wednesday night,
particularly along the coast, and waterspouts will be possible across
the adjacent Atlantic coastal waters. Finally, there is the potential
for storm surge Wednesday evening through early Thursday morning along
the southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina coasts, where
inundation up to 4 feet above ground level is possible.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across southeast South Carolina and southeast
Georgia. Potential impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding could prompt many rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries could rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple locations. Small streams, creeks, canals, ditches may
become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and barriers
could become stressed.
- Flood waters could enter many structures within multiple
communities; some structures become uninhabitable or are washed
away. Flood waters could cover multiple escape routes. Streets
and parking lots become rivers of moving water with underpasses
submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous. Many road and
bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
- Drinking water and sewer services could be negatively impacted.
- Hazardous containers and materials could possibly be present in
flood waters.
* SURGE:
Prepare for life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across coastal areas of southeast Georgia and southeast South
Carolina. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Areas of inundation of saltwater along immediate shorelines and
in low-lying spots farther inland near rivers and creeks, with
storm surge flooding accentuated by waves. Damage to several
buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in normally vulnerable low
spots.
- Moderate to major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching
dunes. Strong and numerous rip currents.
- Minor to moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and
piers. Several small craft broken away from moorings,
especially in unprotected anchorages. Some navigation aids
possibly displaced well off station, creating difficult
navigation near inlets and waterways.
* WIND:
Prepare for life-threatening wind having possible extensive impacts
across southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina, especially along
and near the coast. Potential impacts in this area
include:
- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some window,
door, and garage door failures leading to structural damage.
Mobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed. Damage
accentuated by airborne projectiles. Some locations may be
uninhabitable for weeks.
- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne
projectiles outside.
- Large trees snapped or uprooted.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and access routes
impassable.
- Large areas with power and communications outages, which could
persist for days.
- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a dangerous tornado event having possible significant
impacts across portions of southeast Georgia and southeast South
Carolina. Potential impacts include:
- Isolated to scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution of
emergency plans.
- Scattered locations could experience enhanced damage due to
tornadoes with a few spots of considerable damage, power loss,
and communications failures.
- Scattered locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses,
mobile homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees
snapped or uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed
about.
* OTHER COASTAL HAZARDS:
Prepare for additional coastal hazards along the entire southeast
Georgia and southeast South Carolina coastline including dangerous
rip currents, high surf, and beach erosion.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so immediately.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies
kit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your
home or business.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
