<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 29 at 8:20PM EDT until August 29 at 11:45PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1230 AM EDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...A portion of piedmont North Carolina, including the
following county, Mecklenburg.
* WHEN...Until 1230 AM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including parks, greenways, golf
courses, underpasses, and parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows
over roadways is possible.  A few flood-prone, low-water crossings
may become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 807 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms have
departed the Charlotte metro and only areas of light rain
remains.  These thunderstorms produced 1.25-2.25 inches of
rainfall in about 60 minutes, resulting in excessive runoff
and rapid rises on small streams and drainages in the area.
Stewart Creek and the headwaters of Irwin Creek and Little
Sugar Creek all have exceeded bankfull/Action Stage and are
currently flooding adjacent low-lying areas.  These streams
have not yet crested but the rate of rise is slowing and
crests will occur in the next 30 minutes.  Thereafter, expect
a fast recession below Action Stage/bankfull with improving
conditions after 9 PM.  The Flood Advisory will continue
until streams receded below critical levels.  Please avoid
all area streams until flows recede.
Flooding of Stewart Creek, Irwin Creek, and Little Sugar
Creek greenways is ongoing.  Expect flooding along Stewart
Creek near Southwest Blvd, Lasalle St, and Carrier Dr.
Flooding of Seversville and MLK Jr. community parks is
ongoing.  Irwin Creek is flooding Allen Hills and Double Oaks
neighborhood parks and adjacent areas.  Little Sugar Creek is
flooding Cordella Community Park and Alexander Neighborhood
Park and adjacent areas.
- Some locations that may continue to experience flooding
include...
Uptown Charlotte, Central Charlotte, South Charlotte, East
Charlotte, Southwest Charlotte, Northeast Charlotte,
Northwest Charlotte, West Concord, Belmont, Pineville,
Harrisburg, Freedom Park, The Plaza, Southpark Mall, Hidden
Valley, Paw Creek, The Arboretum, Reedy Creek Park and
University City.
