<senderName>NWS Greenville-Spartanburg (Western North Carolina and Northwest South Carolina)</senderName>
<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 29 at 10:22PM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 415 AM EDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of western North Carolina, including the
following county, Graham.
* WHEN...Until 415 AM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks, hiking
trails and boat-access areas.  Isolated, shallow flows over
roadways is possible.  A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may
become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1016 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms occurring mainly over the Snowbird Wilderness
Area.  Between 1 and 2 inches of rain have fallen over the
past 90 minutes.  This is likely to produce excessive runoff
and rapid rises on small streams within the rural and
uninhabited areas of western Graham County.  Backpackers and
campers should exercise caution on area hiking trails and
avoid low-lying areas near streams for the next few hours.
- Thunderstorms continue over the area and additional rainfall
amounts of 0.5 to 1 inch are expected.  This additional rain
will exacerbate high flows and bankfull conditions.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Robbinsville, Snowbird, and Town Of Santeetlah.

<instruction>Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
