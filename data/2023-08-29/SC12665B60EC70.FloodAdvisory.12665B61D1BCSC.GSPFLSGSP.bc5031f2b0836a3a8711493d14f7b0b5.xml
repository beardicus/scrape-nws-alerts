<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 29 at 12:28AM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 615 AM EDT THIS MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of upstate South Carolina, including the
following counties, Cherokee and Spartanburg.
* WHEN...Until 615 AM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks,
greenways, boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and
parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.
A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1220 AM EDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms
producing torrential rainfall from Boiling Springs to Chesnee
to Gaffney.  The heaviest rainfall has departed northeastern
Spartanburg County but is ongoing across northwest Cherokee
County.  At least 1-2 inches of rain has fallen over the past
hour, with isolated areas in Cherokee County receiving 2.5
inches of rain.  This is causing excessive runoff and rapid
rises on small streams.  Isolated areas of nuisance flooding
are likely over the next couple of hours.
Areas of greatest concern are within the headwaters of
Thicketty Creek near SC 11, including near Shady Grove Rd, SC
110. Cowpens National Battlefield. Fairview Rd, and
Farmington Rd.
- Another 0.5 to 1 inch of rainfall is possible over the next
30-60 minutes as thunderstorms continue over the area before
finally departing.  However. additional heavy rainfall is
possible later tonight.  Given saturated soils, any new
periods of heavy rainfall may cause new flood concerns to
develop quickly.  Please stay weather aware and be prepared
to seek higher ground if you are in an area vulnerable to
flooding.
- Some locations that may  experience flooding include...
Gaffney, Boiling Springs SC, Cowpens, Mayo, Chesnee, Cowpens
National Battlefield, Thicketty, Fingerville, and
Draytonville.

dangers of flooding.
Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.</instruction>
