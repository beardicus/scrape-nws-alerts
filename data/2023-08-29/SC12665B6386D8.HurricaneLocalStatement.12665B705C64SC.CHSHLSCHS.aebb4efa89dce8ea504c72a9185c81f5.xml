SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Idalia continues to track northward across the eastern
Gulf of Mexico while strengthening. Idalia is still forecast to make
landfall as a major hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida
Wednesday morning. After making landfall, Idalia is forecast to track
just inland through southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina
Wednesday evening through early Thursday morning.
Local impacts from Idalia will begin as early as Wednesday morning as
heavy rainfall begins to overspread southeast Georgia and southeast
South Carolina from southwest to northeast. Heavy rainfall is expected
to continue through Wednesday night across the region with 1 to
3 inches of rain forecast along the coast and 4 to 8 inches forecast
for inland locations. Tropical Storm force winds are expected to
develop across southeast Georgia late Wednesday morning, especially
along the coast, with conditions deteriorating Wednesday afternoon and
into Wednesday night as Tropical Storm force winds spread up the coast
and into portions of southeast South Carolina. Tornadoes will be
possible across the area Wednesday afternoon and Wednesday night,
particularly along the coast, and waterspouts will be possible across
the adjacent Atlantic coastal waters. Finally, there is the potential
for storm surge Wednesday evening through early Thursday morning along
the southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina coasts, where
inundation up to 4 feet above ground level is possible.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina,
especially inland of the coast. Potential impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding could prompt many rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries could rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple locations. Small streams, creeks, canals, ditches may
become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and barriers
could become stressed.
- Flood waters could enter many structures within multiple
communities; some structures become uninhabitable or are washed
away. Flood waters could cover multiple escape routes. Streets
and parking lots become rivers of moving water with underpasses
submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous. Many road and
bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
- Drinking water and sewer services could be negatively impacted.
- Hazardous containers and materials could possibly be present in
flood waters.
* SURGE:
Protect against life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across coastal areas of southeast Georgia and southeast South
Carolina. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Areas of inundation of saltwater along immediate shorelines and
in low-lying spots farther inland near rivers and creeks, with
storm surge flooding accentuated by waves. Damage to several
buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in normally vulnerable low
spots.
- Moderate to major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching
dunes. Strong and numerous rip currents.
- Minor to moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and
piers. Several small craft broken away from moorings,
especially in unprotected anchorages. Some navigation aids
possibly displaced well off station, creating difficult
navigation near inlets and waterways.
* WIND:
Protect against dangerous wind having possible significant impacts
across southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina. Potential impacts
in this area include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges and access routes
impassable.
- Travel by vehicle or on foot increasingly difficult. Danger of
death or injury from falling objects such as trees or electric
wires outside.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines, which could persist for hours
or days.
- Some poorly secured small craft could break loose from their
moorings.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a dangerous tornado event having possible significant
impacts across southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina, especially
closer to the coast. Potential impacts include:
- Isolated to scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution of
emergency plans.
- Scattered locations could experience enhanced damage due to
tornadoes with a few spots of considerable damage, power loss,
and communications failures.
- Scattered locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses,
mobile homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees
snapped or uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed
about.
* OTHER COASTAL HAZARDS:
Prepare for additional coastal hazards along the entire southeast
Georgia and southeast South Carolina coastline including dangerous
rip currents, high surf, and beach erosion.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
