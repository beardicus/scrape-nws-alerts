<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 29 at 6:45PM EDT until August 29 at 9:00PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 1230 AM EDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of piedmont North Carolina, including the
following county, Mecklenburg.
* WHEN...Until 1230 AM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including parks, greenways, golf
courses, underpasses, and parking lots.  Isolated, shallow flows
over roadways is possible.  A few flood-prone, low-water crossings
may become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 644 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms across the Charlotte metro.  These storms are
producing 1-2 inches of rainfall within an hour, which will
result in excessive runoff and rapid rises on small streams
and drainages in the area.  Expect impacts to common, flood-
prone areas along several streams including Little Sugar
Creek, Briar Creek, and Irwin Creek to develop over the next
30-60 minutes as these streams and their associated
tributaries respond to the heavy rainfall.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 0.5 to 1 inch are expected
over the area as these storms move very slowly over the
Charlotte area.  Isolated heavier totals are possible.  A
Flash Flood Warning may be required if these storms do not
dissipate or move away from the area quickly enough.  Please
stay weather aware and be prepared to seek higher ground if
you are in an area vulnerable to flooding.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Uptown Charlotte, Central Charlotte, South Charlotte, East
Charlotte, Southwest Charlotte, Northeast Charlotte,
Northwest Charlotte, West Concord, Belmont, Pineville,
Harrisburg, Freedom Park, The Plaza, Southpark Mall, Hidden
Valley, Paw Creek, The Arboretum, Reedy Creek Park and
University City.
