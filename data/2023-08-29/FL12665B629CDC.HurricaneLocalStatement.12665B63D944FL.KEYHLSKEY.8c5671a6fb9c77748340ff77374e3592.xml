**TROPICAL STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT**
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Monroe Lower Keys
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 190 miles west of Key West FL
- 24.6N 84.8W

SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Idalia continues to strengthen in the far southeastern Gulf
of Mexico. There have been no changes to Florida Keys watches and
warnings, with a Tropical Storm Warning remaining in effect for the
Dry Tortugas, and a Tropical Storm Watch for the Lower Keys. Idalia
will continue to accelerate to the north this afternoon, then slowly
turn to the north to northeast this evening into Wednesday. Confidence
continues to increase that the storm will make landfall on Wednesday
morning in the Big Bend region of the Florida Peninsula. Idalia is
currently making its closest approach to the Lower Keys, about 190
miles to the west of Key West. Outside of any squalls, tropical storm-
force wind gusts will continue through late this evening, particularly
along and west of the Lower Keys. Inside squalls, strong, potential
damaging wind gusts will be possible. The persistent southerly winds,
along with King tides, may continue to result in coastal flooding of
around 2 feet above normal high tides. This was observed at this
morning`s high tide and will likely occur again at around the time of
high tide Wednesday morning. In addition, rainfall of 1 to 2 inches,
with locally higher amounts, and few tornadoes cannot be ruled out.
Conditions are expected to gradually improve tonight into Wednesday,
although strong southerly breezes will persist through much of the day
on Wednesday.
No evacuations have been ordered. Monroe County and City of Key West
report facilities and services will remain open. Medical services and
The Key West International Airport remains open. However, there have
been some cancelled flights. For further details go to

POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across the
Florida Keys. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Minor damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and
unanchored mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown
about.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Isolated power and communications outages.
* SURGE:
Prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited impacts
across the Florida Keys. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of roads and parking lots inundated by surge water.
Driving conditions dangerous in places where surge water covers
the road.
- Moderate beach erosion.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
Elsewhere across the Florida Keys, little to no impact is anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across the Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.
- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually
vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding of water
occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become
near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge
closures.
* TORNADOES:
Isolated tornadoes are possible in any squall, with limited impacts
across the Florida Keys. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, mobile homes
pushed off foundations or overturned, large tree tops and
branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving
vehicles blown off roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
If you are exceptionally vulnerable to wind or water hazards from
tropical systems, consider voluntary evacuation, especially if being
officially recommended. Relocate to a safe destination.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging wind
gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the center of
the storm.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news outlets
for official storm information. Listen for possible changes to the
forecast.
There is a threat from tornadoes with this storm. Have multiple ways
to receive Tornado Warnings. Be ready to shelter quickly.
