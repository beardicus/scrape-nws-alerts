<description>* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...The Kobuk River, Noatak River, and Koyukuk River from
Allakaket to Hughes.
* WHEN...Through Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Bankfull conditions and minor flooding of low-lying
areas is possible along the Kobuk River, Noatak River, and the
Koyukuk River from Allakaket to Hughes. As of Tuesday morning,
water levels continue to rise in Allakaket. There is water over
the road that crosses Stanley Slough and water is now covering low
lying areas around the old runway. Water levels crested at Bettles
Monday night and are expected to crest in Allakaket Tuesday night.
Additional rainfall through Wednesday may cause smaller streams
and rivers to rise again.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Between 2 and 4 inches of rain fell the past 5 days over the
Koyukuk Basin from the Dalton Highway Wes and over the Kobuk
and Upper Noatak Basins. Runoff from this rainfall continues
to move down the Kobuk, Noatak, and Koyukuk Rivers. Another
half inch of rain is expected over this area through
Wednesday night.
More heavy rain coming late this week with the remains of
Tropical Storm Damrey could cause further high water this
weekend.
