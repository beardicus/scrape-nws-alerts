<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH WEDNESDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...Dangerous rip currents and large battering waves.
* WHERE...In North Carolina, Eastern Currituck County. In
Virginia, Virginia Beach, and Accomack and Northampton
Counties.
* WHEN...Through Wednesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Breaking waves of 4-5 ft will results in rough surf
conditions and a high risk of rip currents.</description>
<instruction>Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
