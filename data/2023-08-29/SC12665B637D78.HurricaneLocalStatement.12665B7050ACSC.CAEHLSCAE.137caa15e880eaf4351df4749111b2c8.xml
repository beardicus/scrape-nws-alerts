SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Idalia is forecast to track northward across the eastern
Gulf of Mexico while strengthening through tonight. Idalia is forecast
to make landfall as a major hurricane in the Big Bend region of
Florida Wednesday morning. After making landfall, Idalia is expected
to track over southeast Georgia and just inland of the southeast South
Carolina coastline Wednesday evening through early Thursday morning.
Local impacts from Idalia will begin as early as Wednesday morning as
heavy rainfall begins to overspread southeast Georgia and southern
South Carolina. Heavy rainfall will then continue through Wednesday
night across the region with 3 to 7 inches of rainfall forecast, with
locally greater amounts possible. Tropical Storm force winds, along
with isolated tornadoes, will be possible across the eastern Midlands
by Wednesday afternoon and into early Thursday morning.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across the eastern Midlands. Potential
impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, arroyos, and
ditches may become dangerous rivers. In mountain areas,
destructive runoff may run quickly down valleys while
increasing susceptibility to rockslides and mudslides. Flood
control systems and barriers may become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.
Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with
underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.
Many road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
Prepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant
impacts across the western Midlands and CSRA.
* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across the
Midlands of central South Carolina and east central Georgia CSRA.
Potential impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a dangerous tornado event having possible significant
impacts across the eastern Midlands of SC. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- Several places may experience tornado damage with a few spots
of considerable damage, power loss, and communications failures.
- Locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses, mobile
homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees snapped or
uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed about.
Dangerous projectiles can add to the toll.
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
the eastern Midlands of SC.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
No evacuations have been ordered across the Midlands and CSRA at this
time.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies
kit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your
home or business.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, and tornadoes extend well away from the center of the
storm.
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
near a large inland lake, in a low-lying or poor drainage area, in a
valley, or near an already swollen river, plan to move to safe
shelter on higher ground.
There is a threat from tornadoes with this storm. Have multiple ways
to receive Tornado Warnings. Be ready to shelter quickly.
