SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Idalia is continuing to intensify as it moves north and
eventually northeast across the eastern Gulf of Mexico through
Wednesday. Catastrophic storm surge will accompany the storm as it
makes landfall. Watches and Warnings remain in effect for West Central
and Southwest Florida and the adjacent coastal waters.
The following are the primary hazards of concern with Idalia:
* Storm Surge - Areas across the northern Nature Coast could see
catastrophic levels of storm surge, with life-threatening surge also
possible across west-central Florida. The main period of surge looks
to occur late this afternoon through early Thursday. Storm surge
inundation could reach 10 to 15 feet along the Levy county coastline,
8 to 12 across the Citrus County coastline, 6 to 9 feet along the
Hernando and Pasco county coastlines, 4 to 7 feet for the Pinellas,
Hillsborough, and Manatee county coastlines, 3 to 5 feet along the
Sarasota county coast, and 2 to 4 feet along Charlotte and Lee
counties.
* Wind - Winds will start to increase through the day today, with
hurricane force winds possible across much of the area, especially
near the coast. Idalia is forecast to intensify into a major
hurricane. Tropical storm force winds will be possible across the
southern zones. Rush to completion any preparedness activities this
morning. Downed trees and powerlines, with prolonged power outages
will be possible.
* Rainfall - Rain bands from Idalia will lift over the area today as
the storm approaches, with the more consistent tropical rains with the
storm possible later today through Wednesday. A slight to moderate
risk for flooding is possible, mainly along the coast and across the
northern zones, closer to the center of the storm. Rainfall totals of
4 to 8 inches with locally higher amounts up to 12 inches is possible.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across
West Central and Southwest Florida. Remain well away from life-
threatening surge having possible catastrophic impacts. If realized,
these impacts include:
- Widespread deep inundation, with storm surge flooding greatly
accentuated by powerful battering waves. Structural damage to
buildings, with many washing away. Damage greatly compounded
from considerable floating debris. Locations may be
uninhabitable for an extended period.
- Near-shore escape routes and secondary roads washed out or
severely flooded. Flood control systems and barriers may become
stressed.
- Extreme beach erosion. New shoreline cuts possible.
- Massive damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Numerous small craft broken away from moorings with many lifted
onshore and stranded.
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
West Central and Southwest Florida. Remain well sheltered from life-
threatening wind having possible devastating impacts. If realized,
these impacts include:
- Structural damage to sturdy buildings, some with complete roof
and wall failures. Complete destruction of mobile homes. Damage
greatly accentuated by large airborne projectiles. Locations
may be uninhabitable for weeks or months.
- Numerous large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and
roadway signs blown over.
- Many roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. Many bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Widespread power and communications outages.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
West Central and Southwest Florida. Remain well guarded against
dangerous flood waters having possible significant impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals, and
ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid inundation
at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage areas. Some
streets and parking lots take on moving water as storm drains and
retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions become hazardous.
Some road and bridge closures.
* TORNADOES:
Potential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across West
Central and Southwest Florida. Remain well braced against a dangerous
tornado event having possible significant impacts. If realized, these
impacts include:
- The occurrence of scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- Several places may experience tornado damage with a few spots
of considerable damage, power loss, and communications failures.
- Locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses, mobile homes
demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees snapped or uprooted,
vehicles tumbled, and boats tossed about. Dangerous projectiles
can add to the toll.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Do not enter evacuated areas until officials have given the all clear
to return.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Do not be a thrill seeker or risk your life for senseless photos or
videos.
If you are prone to flooding or in an area under a storm surge watch
or warning, be prepared for the possibility of a quick and dramatic
rise in water levels.
If a tornado warning is issued for your area, quickly move to the
safest place within your shelter. Protect your head and body.
