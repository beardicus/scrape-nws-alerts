<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued December 10 at 1:27PM MST until December 15 at 5:00AM MST by NWS RapidCity</headline>
<description>...POTENT WINTER STORM LIKELY NEXT WEEK...
.A strong winter storm will impact the region Tuesday through
Wednesday of next week, with heavy snow, wind, and mixed
precipitation possible for portions of northeast Wyoming and
western South Dakota. Several inches or more of snow is likely in
many areas, especially in the northern Black Hills where there is
the potential for 1 to 2 feet of snow. In addition, strong
northwest winds with gusts over 50 mph will be possible on the
plains east of the Black Hills, supporting potential blizzard
conditions. Further east into south central South Dakota, there
will be the potential for freezing rain and sleet with icing
possible. Much uncertainty remains with respect to the track,
duration, and intensity of the storm, which will impact snow
amounts and winds. This is especially the case for areas just
east and southeast of the Black Hills (including Rapid City,
Custer, and Hermosa) where downslope drying could highly affect
snow amounts. Listen to NOAA Weather Radio or your local media for
the latest updates on this storm.
...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY EVENING
THROUGH LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations over 6
inches possible. Winds could gust as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...The Rapid City area, the Southern Foot Hills, the
Central Black Hills, the Southern Black Hills and the Hermosa
Foot Hills.
* WHEN...From Monday evening through late Wednesday night.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Widespread blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. The cold wind
chills as low as 20 below zero could cause frostbite on
exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Watch means heavy snow, strong winds, freezing
precipitation, and cold temperatures are possible. Monitor NOAA
weather radio, local radio or television, or the Internet for
updates on this potentially dangerous storm. Take time to
prepare for severe winter conditions before the storm develops.</instruction>
