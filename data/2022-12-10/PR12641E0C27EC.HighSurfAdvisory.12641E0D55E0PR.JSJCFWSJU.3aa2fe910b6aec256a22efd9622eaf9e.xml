A Coastal Flood Warning means that flooding is occurring or
imminent. Coastal residents in the warned area should be alert
for rising water, and take appropriate action to protect life and
property.
A High Surf Warning indicates that dangerous, battering waves
will pound the shoreline. This will result in life-threatening
conditions.
All persons should refrain from entering the waters, due to the
risks associated with high surf conditions and rip currents.
