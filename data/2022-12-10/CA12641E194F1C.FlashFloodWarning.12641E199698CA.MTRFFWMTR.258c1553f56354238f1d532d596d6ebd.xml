<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued December 10 at 4:47PM PST until December 10 at 6:30PM PST by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in San Francisco has extended the
* Flash Flood Warning for...
The Colorado burn area in...
Northwestern Monterey County in central California...
* Until 630 PM PST.
* At 447 PM PST, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain over the
Colorado Burn Area. Between 0.5 and 1 inch of rain has fallen. The
expected rainfall rate is 0.5 to 0.9 inches in 1 hour. Additional
rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are possible in the warned area.
Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn area will result in debris flow
moving through the Colorado burn area. The debris flow can consist
of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by heavy rain in and around the
Colorado Burn Area.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flooding of areas in and around the Colorado Burn
Area.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
areas along Hwy 1
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
EXPECTED RAINFALL RATE...0.5-0.9 INCHES IN 1 HOUR</description>
<instruction>This is a life threatening situation. Heavy rainfall will cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks...streams...and
ditches in the Colorado Burn Area. Severe debris flows can also be
anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may be washed away in
places. If you encounter flood waters...climb to safety.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
