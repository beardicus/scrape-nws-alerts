along the immediate Cook Inlet coast through Sunday morning. A
second round of moderate to heavy snow is then expected to
develop across the entire Western Kenai Peninsula Sunday
afternoon and continue through Monday morning before ending from
west to east. The heaviest snow amounts are expected along the
coast from Kenai south to Ninilchik. Gusty northerly winds will
develop in conjunction with the heavier snow Sunday afternoon
and continue through Monday morning. The combination of heavy
snow and gusty winds could significantly reduce visibility.</description>
