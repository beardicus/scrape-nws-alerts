<description>The National Weather Service in San Francisco has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
The River Fire burn area in...
Northwestern Monterey County in central California...
* Until 500 PM PST.
* At 203 PM PST, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain over the River
Fire Burn Area. Between 0.2 and 0.4 inches of rain have fallen.
The expected rainfall rate is 0.5 to 0.9 inches in 1 hour.
Additional rainfall amounts of 0.5 to 1.5 inches are possible in
the warned area. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin
shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn area will result in debris flow
moving through the River Fire burn area. The debris flow can consist
of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by heavy rain in and around the
River Fire Burn Area.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flooding of areas in and around the River Fire Burn
Area.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
mainly rural areas near River Road, in the vicinity of Pine Canyon
Road, and Limekiln Road.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
EXPECTED RAINFALL RATE...0.5-0.9 INCHES IN 1 HOUR</description>
<instruction>Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
