<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued December 10 at 4:58AM AKST until December 12 at 9:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY MORNING
THROUGH MONDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 10 to 20
inches possible. Winds could gust as high as 40 mph.
* WHERE...Western Prince William Sound.
* WHEN...Sunday morning through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Light snow will begin late Saturday night
and gradually become heavier through Sunday. Heavy snow will
occur through Monday morning, before gradually diminishing.
Higher snowfall totals are expected across Portage Valley and
Turnagain Pass, with lower amounts closer to Seward. There is
uncertainty with precipitation types, especially for locations
along the coast where rain/snow mix may occur, which would
result in lower snow totals. Gusty easterly winds will lead to
blowing and drifting snow, making travel difficult along the
Seward Hwy between Girdwood and Whittier and through Turnagain
Pass.</description>
