<headline>Air Stagnation Advisory issued December 16 at 8:31AM PST until December 18 at 10:00PM PST by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...FREEZING FOG ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST THIS
MORNING...
...AIR STAGNATION ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST
SUNDAY...
* WHAT...For the Air Stagnation Advisory, stagnant air is
expected, which may lead to deteriorating air quality. For the
Freezing Fog Advisory, visibility at a quarter of a mile or
less in freezing fog with potential for frost or black ice
building on roadways.
* WHERE...For the Air Stagnation Advisory, all valleys in
southern Oregon. For the Freezing Fog Advisory, portions of
the Rogue Valley north of Talent, including the cities of
Medford, Rogue River and Grants Pass.
* WHEN...For the Air Stagnation Advisory, until 10 PM PST
Sunday. For the Freezing Fog Advisory, until 10 AM PST this
morning.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous driving conditions due to low visibility
and potential frost or black ice on bridges and roadways. Air
stagnation is likely to result in diminishing air quality with
time, especially in and near areas with significant sources of
air pollution. Diminished air quality is likely to cause
health issues for people with respiratory problems if
precautions are not taken.

https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/map/?wfo=mfr</description>
<instruction>If driving, slow down, use your headlights, and leave plenty of
distance ahead of you. Also, be alert for frost on bridge decks
causing slippery roads.
People with respiratory illness should follow their physician`s
advice for dealing with diminished air quality. N95 masks are
effective at filtering out the majority of harmful air
particulates.
State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor
burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be
limited as much as possible. According to state air quality
agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants
close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with
your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area.</instruction>
