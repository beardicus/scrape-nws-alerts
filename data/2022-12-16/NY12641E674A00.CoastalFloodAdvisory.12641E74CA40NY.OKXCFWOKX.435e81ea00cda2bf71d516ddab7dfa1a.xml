<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued December 16 at 6:52AM EST until December 16 at 7:00PM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO 7 PM
EST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...One to one and a half feet of inundation above
ground level expected in vulnerable areas near the waterfront
and shoreline.
* WHERE...Northwest Suffolk County.
* WHEN...From noon today to 7 PM EST this evening.
* COASTAL IMPACTS...Widespread minor to locally moderate flooding
is expected in the most vulnerable locations near the
waterfront and shoreline during the times of high tide. Expect
around 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level in low
lying, vulnerable areas. Several roads and low lying property
including parking lots, parks, lawns and homes/businesses with
basements near the waterfront will experience shallow flooding.
Vehicles parked in vulnerable areas near the waterfront may
become flooded. Flooding will also extend inland from the
waterfront along tidal rivers and bays.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...2 to 4 ft breaking waves will result in
beach erosion and splashover with minor damage possible to dune
structures.
* ADDITIONAL INFORMATION...The timing of windshift from the east
to the north will determine the magnitude of coastal impacts. If
winds back to the north before the time of high tide scattered
minor coastal impacts are likely, while if the winds back to the
north after the time of high tide, minor to locally moderate
impacts are likely.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
