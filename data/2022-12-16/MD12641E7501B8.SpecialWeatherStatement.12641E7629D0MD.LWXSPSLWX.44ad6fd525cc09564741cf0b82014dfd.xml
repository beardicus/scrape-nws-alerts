<description>...SNOW LIKELY ALONG AND WEST OF THE ALLEGHENY FRONT...
Snow showers are likely for locations along and west of the
Allegheny Front in western Maryland and West Virginia late tonight
into Saturday morning. Accumulations around an inch are most
likely, but heavier snow showers and perhaps even a snow squall
are possible between 2 AM and 8 AM. Localized snowfall
accumulations around 2 to 3 inches are possible. The best chance
for heavier snow showers will be around Keysers Ridge, McHenry,
Oakland, and Backbone Mountain just west of Bayard. Interstate 68,
US 219, US 50, and US 40 will be impacted.
The combination of accumulating snow with temperatures in the 20s
means that roads can be slippery and snow covered through the
morning hours Saturday.</description>
