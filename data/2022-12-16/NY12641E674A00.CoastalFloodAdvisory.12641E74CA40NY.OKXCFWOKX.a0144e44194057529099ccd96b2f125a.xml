<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued December 16 at 6:52AM EST until December 16 at 7:00PM EST by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO
7 PM EST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...One to two foot of inundation above ground level expected
in vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...Northeast Suffolk and Southeast Suffolk Counties.
* WHEN...From noon today to 7 PM EST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Widespread minor to locally moderate flooding is
expected in the most vulnerable locations near the Peconic and
Gardiners Bay waterfront and shoreline during the times of high
tide. Expect around 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level
in low lying, vulnerable areas. Several roads and low lying
property including parking lots, parks, lawns and
homes/businesses with basements near the waterfront will
experience shallow flooding. Vehicles parked in vulnerable areas
near the waterfront may become flooded. Flooding will also
extend inland from the waterfront along tidal rivers and bays.
* SHORELINE IMPACTS...4 to 8 ft breaking waves along the ocean
will result in beach erosion and flooding during the times of
high tide. Scattered areas of dune base erosion are possible
along the oceanfront. 2 to 4 ft waves are likely along the north
shore of Long Island, north facing shorelines of the south
forks and Orient Point, with beach erosion and minor damage to
shoreline structures possible.
* ADDITIONAL INFORMATION...The timing of windshift from the east
to the north will determine the magnitude of coastal impacts. If
winds back to the north before the time of high tide widespread
minor to locally moderate coastal impacts are likely, while if
the winds back to the north after the time of high tide, more
widespread moderate impacts are likely.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
