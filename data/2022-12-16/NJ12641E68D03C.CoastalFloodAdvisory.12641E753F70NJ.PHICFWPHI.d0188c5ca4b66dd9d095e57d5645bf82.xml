<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued December 16 at 4:51PM EST until December 16 at 10:00PM EST by NWS Philadelphia - Mount Holly</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM EST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Inundation above ground level expected in low-lying areas
near shorelines and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...Ocean, along Barnegat Bay.
* WHEN...Until 10 PM EST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with some road
closures expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...While the flow has switched to offshore,
the water level remains very high on Barnegat Bay. This is
resulting in areas of moderate flooding. The flooding should
diminish later this evening as the winds continue offshore and
the water is able to drain more.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.</instruction>
