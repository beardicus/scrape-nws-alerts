<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT...
The following message is transmitted at the request of the New Mexico
Departments of Health and Environment, United States Forest Service
and the Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality Response Program.
* WHAT...Smoke from the largest fires in the state will be rapidly
transported toward the northeast through the remainder of the
afternoon and evening. The most impactful near-surface smoke will
remain in close proximity to the fire`s perimeters, particularly
portions of the Mimbres and Lower Rio Grande valleys in southwest
New Mexico. Additionally, layers of dense smoke aloft will be
carried much farther downwind than recent days. This includes areas
between Belen and Socorro northeast toward Abo Pass, Mountainair,
Estancia, Moriarty, and Clines Corners along I-40. Smoke along the
east slopes of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains will also push farther
northeast resulting in diminished air quality for parts of the I-25
corridor in northeast New Mexico and surrounding areas. Overall,
haze will be more persistent away from the larger fires and areas of
blowing dust will, at times, contribute to diminished air quality
for lower elevations through the evening.
* WHERE...The most significant impacts from smoke are expected to
persist across much of Catron, Socorro, northern Grant, northwest
Lincoln, northern Luna, Sierra counties, and southwest Torrance
counties in central and southwest New Mexico and western San Miguel,
western Mora and western Colfax counties in north-central New
Mexico. More details on impacted locations and latest air quality
information can be found at https://fire.airnow.gov.
* WHEN...Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1 pm MDT,
Sunday, May 29, 2022.
* IMPACTS...Those with conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and heart
disease will be especially vulnerable to impacts from poor air
quality, as will adults over age 65, young children, and pregnant
women if smoke concentrations become unhealthy.
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method
available at
https://nmtracking.doh.nm.gov/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
https://nmtracking.doh.nm.gov/environment/air/IndoorQuality.html and
https://cv.nmhealth.org
New Mexicans will also need to take steps to keep their homes cool to
avoid heat-related illnesses. NMDOH offers tips here:
