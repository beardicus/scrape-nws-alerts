<headline>Wind Advisory issued May 28 at 11:14AM PDT until May 30 at 2:00AM PDT by NWS Phoenix</headline>
<description>...WIND ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 AM PDT MONDAY...
...BLOWING DUST ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 3 PM THIS
AFTERNOON TO 8 AM PDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...For the Blowing Dust Advisory, visibility between one
quarter mile and one mile in blowing dust expected. For the Wind
Advisory, west winds 30 to 40 mph with localized gusts as high
as 65 mph, particularly along I-8 near Mountain Springs County
Park.
* WHERE...Southwest corner of Imperial County.
* WHEN...For the Blowing Dust Advisory, from 3 PM this afternoon
to 8 AM PDT Sunday. For the Wind Advisory, until 2 AM PDT
Monday.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous driving conditions due to reduced
visibility. Difficult driving conditions, especially for
larger vehicles traveling along roads with crosswinds. Light,
unsecured objects may become airborne. Minor tree damage
possible.</description>
<instruction>Be ready for a sudden drop in visibility. If you encounter
blowing dust or blowing sand on the roadway or see it
approaching, pull off the road as far as possible and put your
vehicle in park. Turn the lights all the way off and keep your
foot off the brake pedal.
Remember, pull aside, stay alive.
A Wind Advisory means that sustained wind speeds of between
30 and 40 mph are expected, or wind gusts of between 40 and
58 mph. Winds this strong can make driving difficult, especially
for high profile vehicles. In addition, strong winds over desert
areas could result in briefly lowered visibilities to well under
a mile at times in blowing dust or blowing sand. Use extra
caution.</instruction>
