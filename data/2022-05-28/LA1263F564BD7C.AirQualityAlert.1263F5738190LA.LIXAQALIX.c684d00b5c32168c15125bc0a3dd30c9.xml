<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT CDT TONIGHT...
The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality is forecasting an
Ozone Advisory Day for Orleans, Jefferson, St John the Baptist, St
Charles, St Bernard, St Tammany, and Plaquemines Parishes, in effect
until midnight CDT tonight.
The Air Quality Index indicates that ozone will be at the Orange
level, which is unhealthy for sensitive groups. Increasing ozone
levels may cause unhealthy air quality during afternoon hours.
Active children and adults, the elderly, and people with respiratory
diseases such as asthma should avoid prolonged outdoor exertion.
Please take whatever voluntary steps you can to reduce emissions
that contribute to ozone formation. Drive less and make sure your
automobile is in good working condition. Make sure your gas cap is
tight. Wait until after 6 PM to refuel your vehicle and use gas
powered lawn equipment. More information about current air quality
and what you can do to help prevent ozone formation is available at
the D E Q website www.deq.louisiana.gov/enviroflash or by calling
8 6 6 8 9 6 5 3 3 7.</description>
