<headline>Red Flag Warning issued May 28 at 4:47AM CDT until May 29 at 10:00PM CDT by NWS El Paso</headline>
<description>...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TODAY AND ON
SUNDAY...
.An approaching upper level system will create stronger west to
southwest winds Saturday and Sunday afternoons. Winds look to
become gusty in the higher terrain locations as stronger winds
aloft move over the area, especially over the Gila Region and
Sacramento Mountains. Afternoon humidity values will remain in
the single digits through the weekend as well, with overnight
humidity recoveries struggling to make it over 30%. A very dry
spring has led to extremely dry fuels over much of southern New
Mexico and far west Texas. These critical fire weather conditions
are expected to persist through the holiday weekend; with winds
strengthening in the afternoon hours, afternoon humidity values
remaining extremely dry, and overnight humidity recoveries hardly
reaching 30%. Similar conditions are expected on Monday except
the winds will be slightly weaker than they are this weekend.
...RED FLAG WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM THIS MORNING TO
8 PM MDT THIS EVENING FOR LOW HUMIDITY AND STRONG WINDS FOR FIRE
WEATHER ZONES 055 AND 056... ...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 10
AM TO 9 PM MDT SUNDAY FOR LOW HUMIDITY AND STRONG WINDS FOR FIRE
WEATHER ZONES 055 AND 056...
The National Weather Service in El Paso Tx/Santa Teresa has
issued a Red Flag Warning, which is in effect from 10 AM to 9 PM
MDT Sunday. The Fire Weather Watch is no longer in effect.
* WIND...Southwest winds of 20 to 30 mph with gusts up to 40
mph. Potentially stronger gusts in higher terrain areas.

<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now, or will shortly. A combination of
strong winds, low relative humidity, and warm temperatures can
contribute to extreme fire behavior.</instruction>
