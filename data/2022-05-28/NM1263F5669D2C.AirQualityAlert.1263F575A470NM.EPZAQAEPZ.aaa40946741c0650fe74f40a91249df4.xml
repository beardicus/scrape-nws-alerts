<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM MDT SUNDAY...
The New Mexico Departments of Health and Environment has issued an
Air Quality Alert, until 1 PM MDT Sunday.
An Air Quality Alert for Smoke has been issued.
* WHAT...Smoke from the largest fires in the state will be rapidly
transported toward the northeast through the remainder of the
afternoon and evening. The most impactful near surface smoke will
remain in close proximity to the fires perimeters particularly
portions of the Mimbres and Lower Rio Grande Valleys in southwest
New Mexico. Additionally, layers of dense smoke aloft will be
carried much farther down wind than recent days. This includes
areas between Belen and Socorro northeastward toward Abo Pass,
Mountainair, Estancia, Moriarty and Clines Corners along I-40.
Smoke along the east slopes of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains will
also push farther northeast resulting in diminished air quality for
parts of the I-25 corridor in northeast New Mexico and surrounding
areas. Overall, haze will be more persistent away from the larger
fires and areas of blowing dust will, at times, contribute to
diminished air quality for lower elevations through the evening.
* WHERE...The most significant impacts from smoke are expected to
persist across much of Catron, Socorro, northern Grant, northwest
Lincoln, northern Luna, Sierra and southwest Torrance counties in
central and southwest New Mexico and western San Miguel, western
Mora and western Colfax counties in north-central New Mexico. More
details on impacted locations and latest air quality information
can be found at https://fire.airnow.gov
* WHEN...Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1pm MDT
Sunday, May 29.</description>
