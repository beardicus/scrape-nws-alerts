<description>...Gusty winds, colder temps and rain and snow showers for
Memorial Day weekend...
A cold upper-level system will bring showers through Memorial Day,
with a few thunderstorms possible. Breezy to windy conditions
expected each afternoon and evening as well. Much cooler temps
Sunday and Monday with highs in the mid 40s to 50s. Mountain snow
expected tonight through Monday and a few inches possible. Snow
levels could dip down to valley locations Sunday into Monday, but
little to no accumulation expected.
While not in the official growing season, overnight temps will be
trending lower the next few nights. Beginning tonight some valley
locations will see low temperatures drop into the low to mid 30s.
Sunday night and Monday night the temperatures will be the
coldest, with many locations dropping into the 20s. Anyone with
sensitive plants or animals outside should monitor the temperature
forecasts these next few nights and take appropriate preventative
measures.
