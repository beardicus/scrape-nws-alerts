GUSTY WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR NORTHEAST WYOMING AND
WESTERN SOUTH DAKOTA...
.Strong gusty southwest winds coupled with very dry air and warm
temperatures will continue to bring a long duration of critical
fire weather conditions through Wednesday evening.
The strongest winds are expected over northeast Wyoming into far
western SD, where gusts over 50 mph are likely. Minimum afternoon
relative humidities will drop into the teens with poor recovery
tonight, especially on the eastern slopes of the Black Hills.
A cold front will move into the region Wednesday evening. Gusty
northwest winds and increasing relative humidities are expected
behind it, along with chances for snow. The best chances for
accumulating snow will be over northeast Wyoming, the northern
Black Hills, and near the Nebraska border.
