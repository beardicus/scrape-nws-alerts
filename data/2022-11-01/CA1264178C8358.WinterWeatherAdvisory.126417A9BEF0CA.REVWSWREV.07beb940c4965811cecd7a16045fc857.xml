8 PM PDT WEDNESDAY...

for elevations above 5500 feet west of US-395. Elsewhere, up to
2 inches expected. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.
* WHERE...Lassen-Eastern Plumas-Eastern Sierra Counties.
* WHEN...From noon today to 8 PM PDT Wednesday.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A band of steady snow with snow levels
crashing from 6500 feet to valley floors this afternoon. This
will be followed by periods of snow showers tonight through

with a quick 1 to 2 inches of accumulation possible.</description>
<instruction>Even light snowfall causes major travel delays, especially during
periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to
reach your destination. Leave extra space between vehicles since
it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
