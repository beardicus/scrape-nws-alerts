<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued November 01 at 9:20AM AKDT until November 02 at 7:00AM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM THIS
AFTERNOON TO 7 AM AKDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Blowing snow expected. Visibility reduced to as low as
one half mile. Total snow accumulations of 3 to 5 inches.
Northeasterly winds gusting as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...Kuskokwim Delta.
* WHEN...From 1 PM Tuesday to 7 AM AKDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snowfall will begin Tuesday afternoon
along the coast and quickly push inland. Snow will combine
with intensifying northeasterly winds to reduce visibilities
through the overnight hours. Winds and snowfall rates will
diminish in tandem Wednesday morning, putting an end to the
threat.</description>
<instruction>There will also be potential for reduced visibilities as heavy
snowfall rates combine with gusty easterly winds to produce
blowing snow. Slow down and use caution while traveling.
The latest road conditions for the state you are calling from can
be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
