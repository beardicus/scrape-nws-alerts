<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued November 01 at 4:42AM PDT until November 02 at 8:00PM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO
8 PM PDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 3 inches,
except 3 to 9 inches above 7000 feet. Winds gusting as high as
50 mph with 80 to 100 mph gusts along the Sierra crest.
* WHERE...Greater Lake Tahoe Area.
* WHEN...From noon today to 8 PM PDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous
conditions could impact the morning or evening commute. Very
strong winds could cause extensive tree damage. Lake Tahoe
waters will be rough this afternoon with wave heights locally
up to 5 feet.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow levels will crash this afternoon with
snow expected for all elevations. There will be an initial band
of heavy wet snow pushing through this afternoon into the
evening. This will be followed by periods of snow showers tonight
through Wednesday. These showers may bring rapidly changing
conditions with a quick 1 to 2 inches of accumulation possible.</description>
<instruction>Even light snowfall causes major travel delays, especially during
periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to
reach your destination. Leave extra space between vehicles since
it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
