<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM NOON TUESDAY TO 9 PM MDT
WEDNESDAY FOR GUSTY WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR ALL OF
NORTHEAST WYOMING AND WESTERN SOUTH DAKOTA...
.Increasing southwest winds ahead of a developing low pressure
system, coupled with very dry air and warm temperatures, will
support a long duration of critical fire weather conditions over
northeast WY and western SD this afternoon into Wednesday. Gusty
southwest winds will develop this afternoon and will persist into
Wednesday. The strongest winds are expected over northeast WY into
far western SD, where gusts over 50 mph will be possible,
especially Wednesday. Daytime RHâ€™s will fall into the teens both
days. Poor RH recovery tonight will support continued elevated to
critical fire weather conditions, especially on the eastern slopes
of the Black Hills. A cold front will then move into the region
Wednesday evening, with winds shifting northwest and RH`s
increasing.

WEATHER ZONES 318, 319, AND 320...
