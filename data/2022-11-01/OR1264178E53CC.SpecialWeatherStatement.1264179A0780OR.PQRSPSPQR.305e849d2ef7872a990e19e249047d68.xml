<instruction>If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building. If driving,
slow down to avoid hydroplaning. Torrential rainfall is occurring
with this storm and may lead to localized ponding of water in areas
of poor drainage. Do not drive your vehicle through flooded roadways.
Conditions are favorable for the development of weak, brief funnel
clouds. This type of funnel cloud is harmless, but on rare occasions
they can briefly touch down, producing wind gusts over 50 mph. If a
funnel cloud is spotted move indoors and report your sighting to the
National Weather Service.</instruction>
