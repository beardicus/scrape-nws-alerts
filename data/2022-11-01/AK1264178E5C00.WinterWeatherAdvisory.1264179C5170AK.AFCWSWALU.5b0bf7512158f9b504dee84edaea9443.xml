<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued November 01 at 3:52PM AKDT until November 02 at 7:00AM AKDT by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 AM AKDT
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Snow and blowing snow. Visibility reduced to as low as
one half mile. Total snow accumulations of 4 to 7 inches.
Northeasterly winds gusting as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...Kuskokwim Delta.
* WHEN...Until 7 AM AKDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snowfall will push inland from the coast
this evening. Snow will combine with intensifying northeasterly
winds to reduce visibilities through the overnight hours. Winds
and snowfall rates will diminish gradually on Wednesday morning,
with some areas continuing to experience low visibility from
blowing snow into the afternoon.</description>
<instruction>There will also be potential for reduced visibilities as heavy
snowfall rates combine with gusty easterly winds to produce
blowing snow. Slow down and use caution while traveling.
The latest road conditions for the state you are calling from can
be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
