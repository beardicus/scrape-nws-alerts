<headline>High Surf Advisory issued January 20 at 1:37PM PST until January 21 at 4:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST
SUNDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM PST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding
expected within a couple of hours of the high tide Sunday
morning. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 9
to 14 feet are expected, highest on west facing beaches, along
with dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...San Luis Obispo County Beaches and Santa Barbara
County Central Coast Beaches.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 10 AM PST Sunday.
For the High Surf Advisory, until 4 PM PST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely around the time of
the early morning high tides, mainly in vulnerable low-lying
coastal areas such as parking lots, beaches, and walkways.
Significant damage to roads or structures is NOT expected.
There is an increased risk for ocean drowning. Rip currents
can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Large breaking waves
can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and
capsize small boats near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...High tide near 6.0 feet is expected around
600 AM PST Sunday morning.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, so stay off the rocks.</instruction>
