<headline>High Surf Warning issued January 20 at 11:18PM ChST until January 21 at 6:00AM ChST by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM CHST SUNDAY...
...HIGH RISK OF RIP CURRENTS THROUGH LATE SUNDAY
NIGHT...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM SUNDAY TO 6 AM CHST
MONDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking
waves of 14 to 18 feet in the surf zone. For the High Surf
Advisory, large breaking waves of 8 to 12 feet expected in the
surf zone. For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip
currents.
* WHERE...North and east facing reefs of Tinian and Saipan.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Warning, until 6 AM ChST Sunday. For
the High Surf Advisory, from 6 AM Sunday to 6 AM ChST Monday.
For the High Rip Current Risk, through late Sunday night.
* IMPACTS...Breaking waves can sweep people off jetties and
docks, and into dangerous seas. Life-threatening swimming
conditions and significant beach erosion can be expected. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A new pulse of energy has raised wave heights
enough to produce dangerous surf once again. It is expected to be
short-lived, just several hours.</description>
<instruction>Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other waterside
infrastructure.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
