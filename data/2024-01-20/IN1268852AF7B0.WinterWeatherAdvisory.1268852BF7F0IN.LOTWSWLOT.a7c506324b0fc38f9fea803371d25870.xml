<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 20 at 3:44AM EST until January 20 at 10:00AM EST by NWS Chicago</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM CST THIS
MORNING...
* WHAT...Lake effect snow expected. Localized snowfall amounts in
excess of 3 inches expected across far northeast Lake County
east of Gary. Little to no snow accumulation expected south of
U.S. 30.
* WHERE...Lake IN County.
* WHEN...Until 9 AM CST this morning.
* IMPACTS...For portions of northeast Lake County, including the
junctions of I-65, I-80, I-90, and I-94, travel is expected to
be hazardous under any heavy lake effect snow through at least
sunrise. Peak snowfall rates in excess of 2 inches per hour are
likely.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Due to the nature of lake effect snow,
conditions can vary significantly over very short distances,
going from flurries to white out conditions over the span of
just a few miles. This can also result in highly variable
snowfall totals over short distances.</description>
