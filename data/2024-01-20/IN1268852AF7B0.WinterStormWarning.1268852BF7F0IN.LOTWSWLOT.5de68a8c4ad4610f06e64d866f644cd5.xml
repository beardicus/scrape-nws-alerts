<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 20 at 3:44AM EST until January 20 at 10:00AM EST by NWS Chicago</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM CST THIS
MORNING...
* WHAT...Locally very heavy lake effect snow expected. Additional
snow accumulations in excess of 6 inches expected in parts of
northern Porter County through mid-morning.
* WHERE...Porter County.
* WHEN...Until 9 AM CST this morning.
* IMPACTS...For portions of northern Porter County, travel is
expected to be very dangerous in spots through mid-morning under
the most intense lake effect snow. Peak snowfall rates in excess
of 2 inches per hour are likely. Unnecessary travel should be
avoided over northern Porter County through mid-morning.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Due to the nature of lake effect snow,
conditions can vary significantly over very short distances,
going from flurries to white out conditions over the span of
just a few miles. This can also result in highly variable
snowfall totals over short distances.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in
your vehicle in case of an emergency.
The latest road conditions for Indiana are available by calling 1-
