<description>...Prolonged Cold Temperatures in Southwest Virginia, Northwest
North Carolina, and Southeast West Virginia Tonight through the
weekend...
Very cold air will remain over the area through this weekend. Lows
will be mainly in the single digits in the mountains and in the
teens in the foothills and piedmont. Daytime temperatures today will
only be in the teens in the mountains and the mid 20s to around
30 in the foothills and piedmont. Temperatures begin to moderate
on Sunday with highs in the 20s in the mountains and 30s in the
foothills and piedmont, which still means the average temperature
for the day will be 10 to 20 degrees below normal.
In addition to the actual air temperatures, the wind will be gusty
until Sunday afternoon, especially at higher elevations and during
daytime hours. This will result in wind chills from -5 to -20 in the
mountains and in the single digits east of the Blue Ridge.
Data suggests that when the average daily air temperature remains at
least 12 degrees below normal for at least 48 hours, significant
impacts to infrastructure may occur. This includes frozen water
pipes and frozen sprinkler systems.
Take steps now to protect yourself and your property from the
extreme cold. If you go outside, wear several layers of loose
fitting, lightweight, warm clothing rather than one layer of heavy
clothing. Mittens are warmer than gloves. Wear a hat and cover your
mouth with a scarf.
If driving, keep your gas tank near full to avoid ice in the tank
and fuel lines. Check your antifreeze and windshield washer fluid
levels. Be sure to carry a fully charged cell phone. The latest road
conditions for the state you are calling from can be obtained by
calling 5 1 1.
If you have pets or farm animals, make sure they have plenty of food
and water, and are not overly exposed to extreme cold.</description>
