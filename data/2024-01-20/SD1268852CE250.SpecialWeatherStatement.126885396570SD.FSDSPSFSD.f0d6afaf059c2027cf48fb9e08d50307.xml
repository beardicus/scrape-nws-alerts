<description>...STRONG WINDS MAY LEAD TO BLOWING SNOW TONIGHT INTO SUNDAY...
Increasing southerly winds will peak late this evening into early
Sunday morning, with occasional gusts of 40 to 50 mph. In areas
where snow cover is still sufficiently loose, these strong winds
will lead to areas of blowing snow, which could reduce visibility
to a mile or less at times. Further into Sunday, warming road
surfaces may become susceptible to a melt and refreeze of drifting
snow, which could also impact travel with stretches of icy roads.
The strongest winds are expected along and east of the higher
elevations along the Buffalo Ridge in southwest Minnesota, and
would include portions of US Highway 75, US Highway 59, US Highway
14, as well as Minnesota State Highway 23 and 30. While not quite
as strong as farther north, portions of Interstate 90 could also
be impacted by reduced visibility at times.
These areas could also see wind chill values tonight dip to around
25 below zero. However, warming temperatures after midnight should
likewise allow wind chills to recover through the latter half of
tonight.</description>
