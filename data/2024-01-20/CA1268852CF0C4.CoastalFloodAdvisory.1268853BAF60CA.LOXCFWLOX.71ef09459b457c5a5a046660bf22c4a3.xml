<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued January 20 at 1:37PM PST until January 21 at 10:00AM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM PST SUNDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 2 AM TO 10 AM
PST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 5
to 8 feet on west facing beaches, highest near Point
Conception, along with dangerous rip currents. For the Coastal
Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding expected within a
couple of hours of the high tide Sunday morning.
* WHERE...Santa Barbara County Southwestern Coast and Santa
Barbara County Southeastern Coast.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 10 AM PST Sunday. For
the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 2 AM to 10 AM PST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely around the time of
high tide, mainly in vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such
as parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to
roads or structures is NOT expected. There is an increased
risk for ocean drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers and
surfers out to sea. Large breaking waves can cause injury,
wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats
near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...High tide near 6.0 feet is expected at
around 600 AM PST Sunday.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, so stay off the rocks.</instruction>
