<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 20 at 11:24AM AKST until January 21 at 6:00AM AKST by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND, BLOWING SNOW, AND LOW WIND CHILLS FOR SKAGWAY AND
KLONDIKE HIGHWAY TODAY AND TONIGHT...
...HEAVY SNOW FROM PELICAN TO JUNEAU FOR SUNDAY NIGHT INTO
MONDAY...
.A heavy band of snow from a stationary front looks to set up from
Pelican to Juneau for Sunday night through Monday. Resilient cold
air from the north is expected to remain in place through much of
the event, keeping precipitation as snow. Moisture transport
appears to hit Juneau the hardest, prompting the highest snow
totals. At this time, snow looks to fully transition to a wintery
mix and rain early Tuesday morning. However, this transition will
depend on how fast the incoming front can break through the cold
air. It is possible that this event will be long duration.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM AKST SUNDAY...
...WIND CHILL ADVISORY IS CANCELLED...
* WHAT...Blowing snow. Visibilities as low as one half mile. Wind
chills as low as 45 below zero.
* WHERE...Municipality of Skagway.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM AKST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Areas of blowing snow could significantly reduce
visibility. Strong winds could cause tree damage. The cold wind
chills as low as 35 below zero could cause frostbite on exposed
skin in as little as 30 minutes.</description>

People are urged to prepare their property before the onset of
winter weather.
