<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 20 at 1:19PM PST until January 23 at 1:00AM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM PST TUESDAY FOR
THE TAHOE BASIN ABOVE 6500 FEET...
...WINTER STORM WATCH IS CANCELLED...
* WHAT...Snow. Total snow accumulations through Monday night 1 to 2
feet above 7000 feet, with 8 to 14 inches between 6500 and 7000
feet. Below 6500 feet, 1 to 5 inches with locally higher amounts
up to 8 inches. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph with gusts to 75
mph along Sierra ridges.
* WHERE...Greater Lake Tahoe Area.
* WHEN...Until 1 AM PST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult at times. The hazardous
conditions could impact daily commutes through Monday night, with
the most widespread impacts expected Monday morning. Gusty winds
will create choppy lake waters on Lake Tahoe through tonight with
wave heights up to 3 feet.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The main periods of snow are expected this
evening through late tonight, and again late Sunday night into
Monday morning. At other times, lighter snow will continue mainly
near the Sierra crest. Road conditions will vary from wet to
slushy and snow covered across the Tahoe region this evening
through Monday night, check with Caltrans or NDOT for the latest
road conditions.</description>
<instruction>Even lighter snowfall causes major travel delays, especially during
periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to reach
your destination. Leave extra space between vehicles since it takes
longer to stop on slick roadways.</instruction>
