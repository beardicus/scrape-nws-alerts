<headline>Special Weather Statement issued January 20 at 1:34PM MST  by NWS Aberdeen</headline>
<description>Locally strong and gusty winds are expected along the eastern
slopes of the Prairie Coteau tonight into Sunday. South-
southwesterly winds of 20 to 35 mph with occasional gusts of 40 to
50 mph will develop. The locations most affected will be the
higher terrain areas of the Sisseton Hills near Veblen down to
near Clear Lake, as well as up to 15 miles east of the hills.
This includes Interstate 29 between Summit and Peever, or between
mile markers 210 and 225. U.S. Highway 12 from Summit to Milbank
and U.S. Highway 212 from near Kranzburg to near Marietta, MN may
also experience these strong winds. These winds will promote
blowing and drifting snow, along with visibility reduced to less
than a mile. At times, very low visibility of less than one half
mile could occur. Anyone with travel plans across far northeast
South Dakota should be prepared for inclement weather and are
urged to slow down and allow for extra distance between vehicles
if need be.</description>
