<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued January 20 at 7:23PM AKST until January 22 at 9:00PM AKST by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND, BLOWING SNOW, AND LOW WIND CHILLS FOR SKAGWAY AND
KLONDIKE HIGHWAY TODAY AND TONIGHT...
...HEAVY SNOW FROM PELICAN TO JUNEAU FOR SUNDAY NIGHT INTO
MONDAY...
.A heavy band of snow from a stationary front looks to set up
from Pelican to Juneau for Sunday night through Monday. Resilient
cold air from the north is expected to remain in place through
much of the event, keeping precipitation as snow. Moisture
transport appears to hit Juneau the hardest, prompting the
highest snow totals. At this time, snow looks to fully transition
to a wintry mix and rain early Tuesday morning. However, this
transition will depend on how fast the incoming front can break
through the cold air. It is possible that this event will be long
duration.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM SUNDAY TO
9 PM AKST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 11 to
15 inches.
* WHERE...City and Borough of Juneau.
* WHEN...From 9 PM Sunday to 9 PM AKST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be very difficult and is discouraged
unless it is an emergency. The hazardous conditions could
impact the morning or evening commute. Heavy wet snow will be
difficult to manage due to high water content. Increased snow
load could threaten vessel buoyancy for vessels that are
docked.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow is expected to increase in water
content through Monday, becoming increasingly heavy and wet.</description>
<instruction>If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water
with you in case of an emergency.
People are urged to prepare their property before the onset of
winter weather.
For the latest road conditions, where available, call 5 1 1 or
