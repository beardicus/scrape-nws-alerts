<headline>High Surf Advisory issued January 20 at 2:52AM PST until January 21 at 10:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM PST SUNDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 2 AM TO 10 AM PST
SUNDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 5 to
8 feet, along with dangerous rip currents. For the Coastal Flood
Advisory, minor coastal flooding expected within a couple of
hours of the high tide Sunday morning.
* WHERE...Catalina and Santa Barbara Islands, Malibu Coast and
Los Angeles County Beaches.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 10 PM PST Sunday. For
the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 2 AM to 10 AM PST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely around the time of
high tide, mainly in vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as
parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to
roads or structures is NOT expected. There is an increased risk
for ocean drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers and surfers
out to sea. Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people
off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...High tides near 6.0 feet are expected at
around 600 AM PST Sunday.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly in
such conditions, so stay off the rocks.</instruction>
