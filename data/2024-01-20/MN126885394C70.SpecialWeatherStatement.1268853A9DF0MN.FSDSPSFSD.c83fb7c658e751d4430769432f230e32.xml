<description>...STRONG WINDS MAY LEAD TO BLOWING SNOW AND ICY ROADS TONIGHT
INTO SUNDAY...
Southerly winds will increase after midnight and continue well
into Sunday. Sustained southwest winds of 20 to 25 mph with
occasional gusts of 40 to 45 mph will be possible after 3am. These
strong gusts may continue well into Sunday.
Strong winds may lead to areas of blowing snow and minor drifting
over roads, which could reduce visibility under a couple miles at
times. Further into Sunday, warming road surfaces may become
susceptible to a melt and refreeze of drifting snow, which could
also impact travel with stretches of icy roads.</description>
