<description>...PATCHY DENSE FOG THIS MORNING...
Areas of fog will continue to develop across far interior
Southeast Georgia to near Allendale, South Carolina, through
daybreak. The fog will become locally dense at times with
visibilities 1/4 mile more less. The nature of the fog is such
that visibilities will vary greatly over short distances with the
risk for locally dense fog being the greatest near bodies of water
and other low-lying areas such as marshes, swamps and large
ditches. Motorists should remain alert for these conditions this
morning.
Some locations that could see locally dense fog include Allendale,
Statesboro, Portal, Sylvania, Newington, Millen, Metter, Claxton,
Cobbtown and Reidsville.</description>
