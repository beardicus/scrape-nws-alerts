<headline>Rip Current Statement issued November 07 at 2:08AM EST until November 09 at 4:00AM EST by NWS Melbourne</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE TUESDAY
NIGHT...
...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT
THROUGH FRIDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Onset of coastal flooding and additional beach erosion
likely on Tuesday, and then moderate to major coastal flooding
and major beach erosion possible Wednesday and Thursday.
Numerous, strong and life-threatening rip currents with large
breaking waves 7 to 8 feet through tonight, and at least 9 to
10 feet Monday.
* WHERE...Coastal Volusia, Coastal Indian River, Coastal Saint
Lucie, Coastal Martin, Mainland Northern Brevard, Northern
Brevard Barrier Islands, Mainland Southern Brevard and
Southern Brevard Barrier Islands Counties.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Watch, from late tonight through
Friday evening. For the High Rip Current Risk, through at least
late Tuesday night.
* IMPACTS... Coastal flooding impacts will include the potential
for some roads to be closed. Low lying property including
homes, businesses and some critical infrastructure may be
inundated. Major shoreline erosion will be possible this week.
Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore
into deeper water. Large breaking waves can knock you off your
feet and make you even more susceptible to becoming caught in
the seaward pull of a rip current.</description>
<instruction>Conditions favorable for coastal flooding are expected to develop
as early as Tuesday and continue to worsen through mid week.
Coastal residents should pay close attention to the evolving
weather threat this week and be alert for later statements or
warnings as the threat to lives and property may continue to
increase through the week. Now is the time to take action to
protect flood-prone property.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as jetties and
piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs. Entering the water is strongly discouraged for the next
several days!</instruction>
