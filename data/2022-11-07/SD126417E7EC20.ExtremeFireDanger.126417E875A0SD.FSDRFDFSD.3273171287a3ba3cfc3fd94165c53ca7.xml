<description>.DISCUSSION...
Light winds will begin the day, but will see increasing southeast
winds to develop through the late morning/afternoon, with gusts
as high as 30 to 40 mph expected through the Missouri and James
River Valleys by afternoon. Despite a band of clouds lifting
across the region this morning, should see increasing sunshine
through the afternoon. The gusty winds will be accompanied by
temperatures warming through the 40s, with dew points near to
below 10 degrees. This will yield minimum humidity levels of 18 to
28 percent, lowest in the area of strongest winds west of the
James River this afternoon. Will maintain the Red Flag Warning for
areas west of a line from Howard to Parker to Vermillion during
the afternoon hours, though eastern portions of the warning may be
a bit more marginal on reaching criteria, depending on how
quickly the winds increase this afternoon.
Will see many windy days throughout the week ahead, but a strong
storm system will bring increasing humidity to the region Tuesday
and Wednesday, with a good chance for widespread rain and even
snow as much colder air pushes into the region late this week and
into the weekend.
Postpone burning due to the very high or extreme fire danger.
Grass fires can move very quickly.
...EXTREME FIRE DANGER...
The Grassland Fire Danger Index will reach the extreme category
this afternoon. Extreme weather conditions and very low
moisture content of grasses, and other dry organic material
on the ground, indicate that critical burning conditions exist.
All fires have the potential to become large and spread quickly,
becoming erratic with extreme behavioral characteristics.
No outdoor burning should take place.
OUTLOOK FOR TUESDAY AFTERNOON...The Grassland Fire Danger Index
will reach the high category.
The grassland fire danger product reflects fire danger for native
grasses. It is not intended for cured agricultural crops, nor
will it reflect conditions in road ditches which have been mowed.</description>
