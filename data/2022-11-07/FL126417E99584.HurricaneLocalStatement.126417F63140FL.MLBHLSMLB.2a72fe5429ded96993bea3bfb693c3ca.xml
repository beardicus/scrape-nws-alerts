SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Subtropical Storm Nicole will drift westward on Tuesday before
taking a turn west-southwestward Tuesday night into Wednesday, moving
toward the northern Bahamas. Nicole is expected to approach the
eastern Florida Peninsula, potentially near or at hurricane strength,
Wednesday into Wednesday night and will produce significant impacts
across east central Florida. Preparations should begin now for at
least strong tropical storm conditions by mid-week.
A Hurricane Watch is now in effect for Brevard, Indian River, Saint
Lucie and Martin counties, as well as the adjacent Atlantic waters of
Brevard County and the Treasure Coast. A Tropical Storm Watch is now
in effect for the rest of east central Florida, including the Volusia
County Atlantic waters. Additionally, a Storm Surge Watch is now in
effect for the entire east central Florida coast, for the potential of
3 to 5 feet of surge waters above ground level.
Conditions will begin to deteriorate as early as tonight due to the
nature of the storm and the large wind field associated with the
system. Use today to complete preparations, as winds will increase
tomorrow, with increasing shower chances as cells begin to move
onshore. As the center of Nicole nears the east coast of Florida,
tropical storm force winds will begin to overspread the region, with
hurricane conditions possible near and to the north of where the
center makes landfall.
Boating and beach conditions will become increasingly dangerous for a
prolonged period. Strong, gusty northeast winds will produce very high
seas, rough, pounding surf, large breaking waves and numerous life
threatening rip currents. These winds and high seas and surf will
combine with upcoming high astronomical tides to bring the threat of
significant storm surge and major beach erosion around the times of
the next several high tide cycles from Tuesday through Thursday.
To reiterate, conditions over the open Atlantic and in the surf zone
will be extremely dangerous! Entering the water is strongly
discouraged and small craft operators should consider staying in port
until conditions start to improve late this week or the weekend.
Increasing coverage of showers and squalls is also expected from this
storm. Squalls could produce wind gusts in excess of 50 mph,
especially offshore and over coastal counties. Repeated rounds of
heavy showers could produce rainfall totals of 3 to 4 inches over the
coastal counties, with 2 to 3 inches forecast farther inland. Locally
higher amounts up to 6 inches are possible, especially along the coast
closer to where the system makes landfall. This may cause flooding and
ponding of water in poorly drained urban areas, especially where the
water table remains high. This could also cause additional flooding
and standing water concerns over the Saint Johns River Basin.
A threat for tornadoes will likely develop into Wednesday and
Wednesday night as the center nears the east coast of Florida.
Don`t let the fact that the calendar says November or hurricane season
fatigue allow you to become complacent about preparing for this storm.
Make sure your hurricane supply kit is stocked, and you have a plan in
place, especially if you live along the coast or in an area that is
either prone to flooding or has recently experienced flooding.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Prepare for life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across the entire east central Florida coast. Potential impacts in
this area include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
* WIND:
Prepare for life-threatening wind having possible extensive impacts
across Brevard and the Treasure Coast Counties. Potential impacts in this area
include:
- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some having
window, door, and garage door failures leading to structural
damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed.
Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Locations may be
uninhabitable for weeks.
- Many large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and
roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. Several bridges, causeways, and
access routes impassable.
- Large areas with power and communications outages.
Also, prepare for dangerous wind having possible limited to
significant impacts across Volusia County and the interior counties of
east central Florida.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant
impacts from Sanford and Orlando to Lake Okeechobee, and eastward to
the coast. Potential impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals, and
ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
TORNADOES:
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
East Central Florida. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies
kit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your
home or business.
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
When securing your property, outside preparations should be concluded
as soon as possible before conditions deteriorate. The onset of strong
gusty winds or flooding can cause certain preparedness activities to
become unsafe.
Be sure to let friends and family members know of your intentions for
weathering the storm and your whereabouts. Have someone located away
from the threatened area serve as your point of contact. Share vital
contact information with others. Keep cell phones handy and charged.
Check on those who may not be fully aware of the situation or who are
unable to make personal preparations.
If you are a visitor, know the name of the county or parish in which
you are located and where it is relative to current watches and
warnings. If staying at a hotel, ask the management staff about their
onsite disaster plan. Listen for evacuation orders, especially
pertaining to area visitors.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes
to the forecast.
