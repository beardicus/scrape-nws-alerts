SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Subtropical Storm Nicole is expected to bring widespread impacts
with prolonged coastal flooding, tropical-storm-force winds, heavy
rainfall, rough surf, and rip currents.
Nicole is expected to reach Hurricane strength as it crosses through
the Bahamas and towards the southeast Florida peninsula. The current
track has Nicole moving across central Florida, and then turning north
and northeast over northern Florida and southeast Georgia before
racing across the Carolinas and Mid Atlantic states this weekend.
Localized flash flooding risk on Thursday and Friday, mainly impacting
coastal areas and along the St Johns River. Tropical Storm Warnings and
Storm Surge Warnings have been put into effect for coastal southeast
Georgia and northeast Florida and the St. Johns River. Tropical Storm
Watches are in effect for inland portions of northeast Florida.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Protect against life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across coastal northeast Florida, coastal southeast Georgia,
and the St. Johns River Basin. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Several
small craft broken away from moorings, especially in unprotected
anchorages.
* WIND:
Protect against dangerous wind having possible significant impacts
across portions of coastal and inland northeast Florida. Potential
impacts in this area include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
Also, protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts
across the rest of northeast Florida and southeast Georgia.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across coastal northeast Florida. Potential impacts
include:
- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter currents.
Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may become swollen
and overflow in spots.
- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually
vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding of water
occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage areas.
Several storm drains and retention ponds become near-full and
begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge closures.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
coastal northeast Florida. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned, large
tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees knocked
over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats pulled
from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
For those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,
falling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move,
relocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help keep
roadways open for those under evacuation orders.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
If heading to a community shelter, become familiar with the shelter
rules before arrival, especially if you have special needs or have
pets. Take essential items with you from your Emergency Supplies Kit.
Storm surge is the leading killer associated with tropical storms and
hurricanes! Make sure you are in a safe area away from the surge zone.
Even if you are not in a surge-prone area, you could find yourself
cutoff by flood waters during and after the storm. Heed evacuation
orders issued by the local authorities.
Rapidly rising flood waters are deadly. If you are in a flood-prone
area, consider moving to higher ground. Never drive through a flooded
roadway. Remember, turn around don`t drown!
If in a place that is vulnerable to high wind, such as near large
trees, a manufactured home, upper floors of a high-rise building, or
on a boat, consider moving to a safer shelter before the onset of
strong winds or flooding.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
