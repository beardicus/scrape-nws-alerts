<senderName>NWS Midland-Odessa (Western Texas and Southeastern New Mexico)</senderName>
<headline>Flood Warning issued September 06 at 3:52PM CDT until further notice by NWS Midland-Odessa</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Midland/Odessa TX has issued a
Flood Warning for the following rivers in Texas...
Rio Grande at Castolon affecting Brewster County.
Rio Grande at Boquillas affecting Brewster County.
Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch affecting Brewster County.
.Thunderstorms have produced heavy rainfall over the Rio Conchos
basin over the past few weeks.  As a result, high flows are expected
to come out of the Rio Conchos and into the Rio Grande over the next
week.  These flows may result in considerable flooding of the Rio
Grande from Presidio downstream through Big Bend National Park.
For the Rio Grande...including Presidio International Bridge,
Presidio 5SE, Castolon, Johnson Ranch, Boquillas...Major flooding is
forecast.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY MORNING UNTIL FURTHER
NOTICE...
* WHAT...Major flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch.
* WHEN...From Wednesday morning until further notice.
* IMPACTS...At 12.0 feet (3.7 meters), the river reaches bankfull,
minor lowland flooding occurs, and no significant damage is
expected.
At 15.0 feet (4.6 meters), flood stage is reached.  Moderate
lowland flooding begins.  Roads that lead to Cottonwood Campground
and River Road may flood.  Stages are practically synonymous with
the gage at Cottonwood Campground at Castolon (CSTT2), and
therefore represent the reach from Santa Elena Canyon through
Cottonwood Campground, where damage may occur.  Cattle also graze
in the lowlands, and may be threatened.
At 19.0 feet (5.8 meters), the river reaches major flood stage.
Flooding begins to occur upstream in Cottonwood Campground at
Castolon, as stages at each location are practically synonymous.
Moderate lowland flooding begins at the gage site, but no damage
occurs.  The gage is inaccessible, as River Road is impassable at
several locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 3:15 PM CDT Tuesday the stage was 9.2 feet (2.8 meters).
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above flood stage
late tomorrow morning and continue rising to 20.4 feet (6.2
meters) Sunday morning. Additional rises are possible
thereafter.
- Flood stage is 15.0 feet (4.6 meters).
- Flood History...No available flood history.
