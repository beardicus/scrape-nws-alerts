<description>...The National Weather Service in Midland/Odessa TX has issued a
Flood Warning for the following rivers in Texas...
Rio Grande at Boquillas affecting Brewster County.
.Thunderstorms have produced heavy rainfall over the Rio Conchos
basin over the past few weeks.  As a result, high flows are expected
to come out of the Rio Conchos and into the Rio Grande over the next
week.  These flows may result in considerable flooding of the Rio
Grande from Presidio downstream through Big Bend National Park.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM THIS EVENING UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE...
* WHAT...For the Rio Grande...including Boquillas...Moderate
flooding is forecast.

* IMPACTS...At 12.0 feet (3.7 meters), the river reaches bankfull,
and no damage is expected.  Preparations may be necessary to
remove water pumps.  The park should be notified at this time if
additional rises are expected so they will have time to remove the
pumps.
At 13.0 feet (4.0 meters), the river reaches minor flood stage.
Water reaches the water pumps maintained by the park service that
are used to water the campgrounds and to provide water to the
employee living quarters.  It may be necessary for park personnel
to remove the pumps.
