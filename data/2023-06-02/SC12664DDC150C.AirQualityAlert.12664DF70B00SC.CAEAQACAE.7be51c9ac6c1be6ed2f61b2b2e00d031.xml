<description>...Air Quality Alert in effect from 10 AM to 8 PM EDT Saturday...
The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control
in Columbia SC has issued a Code Orange Ozone Action Day for the
Catawba region of South Carolina in effect from 10 AM
to 8 PM EDT Saturday.
An ozone action day means that atmospheric conditions will
likely produce unhealthy concentrations of ground level ozone
air pollution. A Code Orange forecast indicates that ground
level ozone concentrations are expected to be unhealthy for
sensitive groups, which includes people with lung disease,
older adults and children. Sensitive groups should reduce
prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion, take more breaks, and
do less intense activities, especially during afternoon and
early evening hours. You can help prevent ozone pollution by
walking or riding your bicycle, taking your lunch to work,
reducing idling, conserving energy, and keeping your vehicle
properly tuned. For additional information, please visit the
South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental
Control web site at http://www.scdhec.gov/ozone or the
Environmental Protection Agency AirNow website at
