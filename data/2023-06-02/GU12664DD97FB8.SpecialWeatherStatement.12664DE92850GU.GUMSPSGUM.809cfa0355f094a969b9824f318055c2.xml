<description>...HEAVY RAIN AND GUSTY WINDS POSSIBLE LATE SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH
MONDAY...
A tropical system, Invest 98W, continues to be monitored by the
Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and your National Weather
Service Forecast Office in Guam. At this time, we expect this
tropical disturbance to lift slowly north as it tracks roughly
parallel to the Marianas, west of the coastal waters.
Heavy rainfall will be the main concern with this disturbance, with
the potential for 4 to 8 inches of rainfall, perhaps with locally
higher amounts. Additionally, stronger winds on the northern and
eastern flanks of the system may give Guam sustained winds of 25 to
35 mph, with gusts to 45 mph possible with any heavier shower or
thunderstorm that develops.
Much uncertainty exists amongst the various model guidance, and
this system is still very early in its formation stage.
Additional changes in the forecast track, intensity, and impacts
to Guam. We urge the first responders and the public to continue
to monitor the situation for later forecast updates.</description>
