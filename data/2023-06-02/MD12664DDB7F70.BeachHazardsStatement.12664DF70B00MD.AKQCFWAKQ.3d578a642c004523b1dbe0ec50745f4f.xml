<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued June 02 at 3:48PM EDT until June 03 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Wakefield</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY MORNING
THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Dangerous rip currents expected.
* WHERE...In Maryland, Maryland Beaches County. In Virginia,
Accomack and Northampton Counties.
* WHEN...From Saturday morning through Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw a swimmer or
surfer head first into the bottom causing neck and back
injuries.</description>
<instruction>Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
