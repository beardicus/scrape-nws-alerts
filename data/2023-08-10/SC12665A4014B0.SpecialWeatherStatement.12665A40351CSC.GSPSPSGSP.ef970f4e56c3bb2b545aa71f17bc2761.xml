<description>...An area of thunderstorms with intense lightning and heavy

Anderson...and Pickens Counties through 815 AM EDT...
At 728 AM EDT, Doppler radar indicated the leading edge of an area
of thunderstorms with intense lightning and heavy rainfall along a

miles northeast of Anderson, and moving east at 35 mph.
Locations to be impacted include...
Greenville, Easley, Powdersville, Greer, Mauldin, Taylors,
Simpsonville, Berea and Five Forks.
In addition to intense lightning, very heavy rainfall rates up to 2
inches per hour will be possible in these areas.</description>
<instruction>Torrential rainfall may flood areas with poor drainage, such as
ditches and underpasses. Avoid these areas and do not cross flooded
roads. Water levels of small streams may also rise rapidly. Seek
higher ground if threatened by flood waters.
Frequent lightning is occurring with these storms. If outdoors, try
to get indoors or into a hard topped vehicle. Otherwise, stay away
from open areas and isolated high objects such as trees. When
indoors, stay away from windows and doors and avoid using wired
electronic devices. Do not take a shower or bath. Try to unplug
unnecessary appliances before the storms approach.</instruction>
