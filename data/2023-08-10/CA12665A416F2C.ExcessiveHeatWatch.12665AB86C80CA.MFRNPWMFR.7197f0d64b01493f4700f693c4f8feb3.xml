<headline>Excessive Heat Watch issued August 10 at 1:19PM PDT until August 17 at 5:00PM PDT by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...EXCESSIVE HEAT WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Potential for high heat risk across the region. High
temperatures reaching up to 112 degrees and overnight lows as
warm as 69 degrees. Multiple days of heat increases the heat
risk.
* WHERE...Shasta, Scott and Klamath River Valleys. The warmest
temperatures will be in the Klamath River Valley.
* WHEN...From Sunday afternoon through Thursday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous heat will significantly increase the
potential for heat related illnesses, particularly for those
without air conditioning, or those working or participating in
outdoor activities without adequate hydration.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...If thunderstorms do form, then cloud cover
will impact temperatures throughout the event. The cloud cover
would reduce high temperatures and perhaps keep temperatures
warmer than anticipated overnight.

<instruction>Monitor the latest forecasts and warnings for updates on this
situation. Be prepared to drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-
conditioned room, stay out of the sun, and check up on relatives
and neighbors.
Young children and pets should never be left unattended in
vehicles under any circumstances. This is especially true during
warm or hot weather when car interiors can reach lethal
temperatures in a matter of minutes.</instruction>
