<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 10 at 10:11AM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1245 PM EDT THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...A portion of piedmont North Carolina, including the
following county, Mecklenburg.
* WHEN...Until 1245 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks, greenways,
boat-access areas, golf courses, underpasses, and parking lots.
Isolated, shallow flows over roadways is possible.  A few flood-
prone, low-water crossings may become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 959 AM EDT, Heavy rainfall has ended across the Charlotte
metro, but a very quick burst of 1-2&quot; of rainfall fell in
less than an hour, causing excessive runoff and rapid stream
rises.  Nuisance flooding is ongoing along Little Sugar
Creek, primarily impacting the Little Sugar Greenway and
especially near Medical Center Drive.  Edwards Branch at
Sheffield Dr is also out of its banks above Action Stage but
it has already crested and will be falling back within bank
momentarily.
Rapid rises to near bankfull/Action Stage levels are also
underway along Briar Creek.  Significant rises are occurring
along Irwin Creek as well, but it is expected to stay within
its banks.  Fortunately, smaller tributaries have crested and
are already receding.  Therefore, expect all streams to fall
below bankfull levels within the next 60-90 minutes.
- Light to moderate rainfall will persist for the next 30-60
minutes but no additional heavy rainfall is expected through
the early afternoon hours.  Up to an additional 0.25 inches
is possible.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Uptown Charlotte, Central Charlotte, South Charlotte, East
Charlotte, Southwest Charlotte, Northeast Charlotte,
Pineville, Freedom Park, Southpark Mall, The Plaza, The
Arboretum and Hidden Valley.
