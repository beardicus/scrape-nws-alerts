<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1245 PM EDT THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...A portion of piedmont North Carolina, including the
following county, Mecklenburg.
* WHEN...Until 1245 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including parks, greenways,
golf courses, underpasses, and parking lots.  Isolated, shallow
flows over roadways is possible.  A few flood-prone, low-water
crossings may become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1054 AM EDT, Rainfall has ended across the Charlotte metro
and no additional heavy rainfall is expected.  However, an
earlier round of thunderstorms produced torrential rainfall
totaling 1-2&quot; in less than an hour, causing excessive runoff
and rapid stream rises.
Little Sugar Creek, Briar Creek, and McMullen Creek all
remain elevated following earlier heavy rainfall.  Little
Sugar Creek is currently flooding the Little Sugar Greenway,
but it has crested and will continue to recede back below
critical levels over the next hour.  Expect continued impacts
near Medical Center Dr, Hillside Ave, and Archdale Dr.
Briar Creek near Shamrock Dr and McMullen Creek at Addison
Dr/Lincrest Pl are out of their banks flooding adjacent low-
lying areas.  Expect shallow flooding of Addison Dr over the
next half hour.  The headwaters of both creeks are cresting
and will begin to recede over the next 30 minutes, falling
back within their banks within the next 60-90 minutes.  Briar
Creek is also out of bank near Independence Blvd, Providence
Rd, and Colony Rd, impacting adjacent low-lying areas with
nuisance flooding, including along the Briar Creek Greenway
and at the Myers Park Country Club.
People are urged to stay away from area streams until flood
waters recede.  Rapid stream flows can quickly sweep you
away.
- Some locations that may be experiencing flooding include...
Uptown Charlotte, Central Charlotte, South Charlotte, East
Charlotte, Southwest Charlotte, Northeast Charlotte,
Pineville, Freedom Park, Southpark Mall, The Plaza, The
Arboretum and Hidden Valley.
