<instruction>Remain alert for a possible tornado! Tornadoes can develop quickly
from severe thunderstorms.
Prepare immediately for damaging winds. People outside should move
to a shelter, inside a strong building and away from windows.
Intense thunderstorm lines can produce brief tornadoes and widespread
significant wind damage. Although a tornado is not immediately
likely, it is best to move to an interior room on the lowest floor of
a building. This storm may cause serious injury and significant
property damage.
Continuous cloud to ground lightning is occurring with this storm.
Move indoors immediately. Lightning is one of nature`s leading
killers. Remember, if you can hear thunder, you are close enough to
be struck by lightning.</instruction>
