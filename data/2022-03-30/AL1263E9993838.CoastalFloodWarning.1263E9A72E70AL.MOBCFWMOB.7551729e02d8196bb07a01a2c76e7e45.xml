* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, moderate coastal flooding
is expected with 2 to 3.5 feet above normally dry ground in the
Mobile Bay region including the U.S. 90 Causeway. For the High
Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking waves of 9 to 12 feet
in the surf zone. For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip

High Rip Current Risk, through late Friday night.
* IMPACTS...Numerous roads may be closed. Low lying property
including homes, businesses, and some critical infrastructure
will be inundated. Some shoreline erosion will occur. Breaking
waves can sweep people off jetties and docks, and into dangerous
seas. Life-threatening swimming conditions and significant beach
erosion can be expected. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other waterside
infrastructure.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
