<headline>Special Weather Statement issued March 30 at 10:57PM CDT  by NWS Brownsville</headline>
<description>...Smoke from Wildfire on the Santa Gertrudis Division of the King
Ranch to Reach Northeast Brooks and Northwest Kenedy County...
A wildfire...known as the Borrega Fire...near the Kleberg and Jim
Wells County line has been spreading smoke south and southwest
late this evening...and a surge of wind from the north and
northeast will bring the smoke and potentially some of the
wildfire into far northwestern Kenedy and far northeastern Brooks
County...including State Highway 285...by midnight and perhaps
into the early morning hours of Thursday.
Travelers along State Road 285 between Falfurrias and Riviera
should be alert to lowered visibility as low as 1 mile...and
residents in the area should remain alert to possible rapid spread
of the ongoing fire due to north-northeast winds that could gust
to 25 to 30 mph through 1 AM or later.</description>
