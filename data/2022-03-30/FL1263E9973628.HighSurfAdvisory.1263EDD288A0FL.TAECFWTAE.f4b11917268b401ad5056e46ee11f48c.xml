<headline>High Surf Advisory issued March 30 at 2:34AM EDT until April 01 at 2:00AM EDT by NWS Tallahassee</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH FRIDAY
EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT FROM 8 PM THIS EVENING TO
2 AM EDT FRIDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THIS EVENING
THROUGH THURSDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Minor to moderate coastal flooding possible. For the High
Surf Advisory, large breaking waves up to 6 feet expected in
the surf zone. For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip
currents expected.
* WHERE...Coastal Franklin County.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, from 8 PM this evening to 2
AM EDT Friday. For the Coastal Flood Watch, from this evening
through Thursday evening. For the High Rip Current Risk,
through Friday evening.
* IMPACTS...Water levels are expected to be highest east of
Carrabelle. With peak water levels of 2 to 4 feet above ground
possible, overwash onto Alligator Point Road is possible, as is
minor to moderate flooding of areas near St Teresa Beach. Due to
accompanying high surf, some shoreline erosion may occur.
Dangerous rip currents are expected and can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
