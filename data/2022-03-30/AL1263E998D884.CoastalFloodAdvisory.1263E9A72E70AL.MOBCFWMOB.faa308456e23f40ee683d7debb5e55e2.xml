<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued March 30 at 12:05PM CDT until March 31 at 6:00AM CDT by NWS Mobile</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM CDT THURSDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE FRIDAY
NIGHT...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM CDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Warning, dangerously large breaking
waves of 9 to 12 feet expected in the surf zone. For the
Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding expected with 2
to 3 feet above normally dry ground in the Mobile Bay region
and 1 to 2 feet above normally dry ground in the Western
Florida panhandle. For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous
rip currents.
* WHERE...In Alabama, Baldwin Coastal and Mobile Coastal
Counties. In Florida, Santa Rosa Coastal, Okaloosa Coastal and
Escambia Coastal Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Warning, until 6 PM CDT Thursday. For
the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 6 AM CDT Thursday. For the
High Rip Current Risk, through late Friday night.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Breaking waves can sweep
people off jetties and docks, and into dangerous seas. Life-
threatening swimming conditions and significant beach erosion
can be expected. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers
away from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening
surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other waterside
infrastructure.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
