<headline>Red Flag Warning issued March 30 at 11:50AM EDT until March 31 at 6:00AM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...VERY WINDY CONDITIONS AND ONGOING WILDFIRES WILL YIELD
CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS IN AND NEAR THE GREAT SMOKY
MOUNTAINS THROUGH TONIGHT...
.Strong southerly winds will ramp up quickly this afternoon and
evening across the southwest mountains of western North Carolina
ahead of an approaching cold front. While relative humidity
values have briefly fallen into the 30s percent range around
midday, the moisture will steadily increase under southerly flow
through the late afternoon and evening hours. However, the very
windy conditions will persist and worsen in areas of active fire
suppression activity, and the onset of rain showers along the
approaching front will be delayed until the early morning hours
Thursday. This will provide a setup for critical fire weather
conditions to develop this afternoon through most of tonight.
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM EDT THURSDAY FOR HIGH
WINDS AND ACTIVE FIRE SUPPRESSION ACTIVITIES...
The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has issued
a Red Flag Warning for high winds, which is in effect until 6 AM
EDT Thursday.
* AFFECTED AREA...Swain, Haywood, Graham, Northern Jackson and the
Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
* TIMING...Winds will increase through the afternoon hours, peak
this evening and early overnight, then slowly wane through
daybreak Thursday.
* WINDS...South 20 to 30 mph with gusts of 50 to 60 mph,
especially at elevations above 3500 feet.
* HUMIDITY...As low as 38 percent early, but rising through the
40s and into the 50s tonight.
* FUEL MOISTURE...Below 10 percent, with continued drying until
the rain arrives later tonight.
* IMPACTS...Outdoor fires may easily grow out of control under
these conditions. Fires could quickly run long distances and
pose a hazard to downwind communities.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now, or will shortly. A combination of
strong winds, low relative humidity, and warm temperatures can
contribute to extreme fire behavior.</instruction>
