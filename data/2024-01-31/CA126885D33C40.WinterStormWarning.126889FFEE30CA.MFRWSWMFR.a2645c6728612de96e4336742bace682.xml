<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING NOW IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM THIS MORNING TO
7 AM PST THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snowfall accumulations of 7
to 14 inches for most roadways, elevations above 5500 feet could
see accumulations up to 3 feet. South winds 35 to 45 mph with
gusts as high as 60 mph.
* WHERE...Areas of Siskiyou County at and above 4000 feet,
including ridgelines in the Siskiyou Mountain Range and higher
terrain around Mount Shasta. Affected roadways include Highway
89 near Snowmans Summit and Highway 3 south of Callahan.
* WHEN...From 11 AM this morning to 7 AM PST Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Patchy
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. The
hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening
commute. Strong winds could cause tree damage.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The heaviest snowfall will occur late this
afternoon through this evening. Snow will mostly occur above
4000 feet, but high snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour are
possible late this afternoon through this evening which could
bring snow levels down to around 3500 feet on Interstate 5.
Winter weather impacts like poor visibility and snow on roads
are why elevations below 4000 feet were included despite our
expectation that accumulations will be limited.

protective action now.</instruction>
