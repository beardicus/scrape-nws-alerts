<headline>Flood Watch issued April 30 at 11:59AM EDT until May 02 at 10:00AM EDT by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 8 PM EDT THIS EVENING THROUGH
TUESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of south central Maine, including the following
areas, Coastal Waldo, Interior Waldo, Knox, Lincoln and Sagadahoc.
* WHEN...From 8 PM EDT this evening through Tuesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Current streamflows are near normal, but excessive rain
combined with saturated ground will lead to higher than
normal runoff. This may cause river levels to exceed minor
flood stage at several locations. Excessive runoff will also
coincide with the Monday morning high tide, which will lead
to additional concerns with slow drainage.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
