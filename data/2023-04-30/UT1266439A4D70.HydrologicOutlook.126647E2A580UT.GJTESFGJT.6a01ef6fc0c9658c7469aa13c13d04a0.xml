<description>...INCREASED RELEASES FROM MCPHEE DAM AND HEAVY RUNOFF FROM SNOWMELT
IN SMALLER TRIBUTARIES WILL LEAD TO HIGH FLOWS AND INCREASING RIVER
LEVELS ALONG THE DOLORES RIVER BASIN UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE...
Areas along the Dolores River from McPhee Dam to the confluence with
the Colorado River will be impacted by increasing river flows and
river levels until further notice.
Releases are increasing from McPhee Dam in preparation for elevated
inflows due to the melting of this year`s snowpack. As temperatures
increase into early next week...the melting of this snowpack will
accelerate. Runoff along tributaries into the Dolores will bring
additional flows to the reservoir releases. High flows may impact
those living adjacent to these water ways, and can expect to see low
land flooding into early next week. Recreational interest should be
prepared for the impacts of high flows along the Dolores River.
Camping areas and access to the river may become inaccessible or
inundated. Please heed local advisories and closures.
Stay tuned for additional statements and/or Watches and Warnings as
river levels continue to rise.</description>
