<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued April 30 at 9:25PM EDT until May 01 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 AM EDT MONDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM EDT MONDAY
THROUGH MONDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 5 to
8 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards Statement,
dangerous rip currents and strong longshore currents in the surf
zone.
* WHERE...Ocracoke Island beaches.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 5 AM EDT Monday. For
the Beach Hazards Statement, from 8 AM EDT Monday through
Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Strong longshore
currents will create dangerous swimming conditions.</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
