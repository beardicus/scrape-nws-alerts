<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued April 30 at 3:21AM EDT until April 30 at 10:00PM EDT by NWS Philadelphia - Mount Holly</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Up to one half foot of inundation above ground level in
low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...Ocean and Coastal Ocean.
* WHEN...Until 10 PM EDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...At this level, flooding begins on the most
vulnerable roads in coastal and bayside communities, and along
inland tidal waterways. Some partial or full road closures are
possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Water remains trapped in Barnegat Bay and
although levels have diminished somewhat overnight, they will
rise once again with the high tide cycle early this morning and
especially the high tide cycle later this afternoon into this
evening. Heavy rain is also expected today and this may
exacerbate the flooding.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
