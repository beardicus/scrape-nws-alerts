<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 AM EDT MONDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents,
large breaking waves, and strong longshore currents in the surf
zone. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, 1 to 2 feet of inundation
above ground level expected in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking
waves of 5 to 8 feet expected in the surf zone.
* WHERE...West Carteret, East Carteret and Coastal Onslow
Counties.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 10 PM EDT this
evening. For the High Surf Advisory, until 5 AM EDT Monday.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, until 8 PM EDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Dangerous swimming and
surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip currents
can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper
water. Dangerous shore break can throw a swimmer or surfer
head first into the bottom causing neck and back injuries.
Strong longshore currents will create dangerous swimming
conditions.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
