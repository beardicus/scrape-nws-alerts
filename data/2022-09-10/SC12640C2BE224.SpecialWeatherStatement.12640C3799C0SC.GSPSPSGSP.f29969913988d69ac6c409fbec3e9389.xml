<headline>Special Weather Statement issued September 10 at 7:21PM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...A THUNDERSTORM WITH INTENSE LIGHTNING AND TORRENTIAL RAINFALL WILL
IMPACT SOUTHWESTERN MECKLENBURG...NORTHWESTERN CHESTER AND CENTRAL
YORK COUNTIES UNTIL 800 PM EDT...
At 721 PM EDT, Doppler radar was tracking a thunderstorm with intense
lightning and torrential rainfall 4 miles north of Chester, or near
Lowrys, moving north at 25 mph.
Locations to be impacted include...
Rock Hill, York, Chester, Fort Mill, Tega Cay, Clover, Newport,
Mcconnells, Lowrys and Steele Creek.
Very heavy rainfall rates up to 2 inches per hour will be possible in
these areas.</description>
<instruction>The combination of gusty winds and saturated soil conditions will
cause scattered trees and power lines to fall. Seek shelter inside an
interior room.
Torrential rainfall may flood areas with poor drainage, such as
ditches and underpasses. Avoid these areas and do not cross flooded
roads. Water levels of small streams may also rise rapidly. Seek
higher ground if threatened by flood waters.
Frequent lightning is occurring with this storm. If outdoors, try to
get indoors or into a hard topped vehicle. Otherwise, stay away from
open areas and isolated high objects such as trees. When indoors,
stay away from windows and doors and avoid using wired electronic
devices. Do not take a shower or bath. Try to unplug unnecessary
appliances before the storm approaches.</instruction>
