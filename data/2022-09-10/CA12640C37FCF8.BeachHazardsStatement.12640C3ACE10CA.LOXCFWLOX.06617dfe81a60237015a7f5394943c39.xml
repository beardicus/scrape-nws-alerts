<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued September 10 at 7:54PM PDT until September 11 at 2:00PM PDT by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY AFTERNOON...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 AM PDT
SUNDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents and
breaking waves of three to six feet.
* WHERE...Catalina and Santa Barbara Islands and Los Angeles
County Beaches.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 2 AM PDT Sunday.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, through Sunday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely, around the time of
high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as
parking lots, beaches, and walkways. Significant damage to
roads or structures is NOT expected. There is an increased
risk of ocean drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers and
surfers out to sea. Waves can wash people off beaches and
rocks, and capsize small boats nearshore.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to hazardous swimming conditions, or
stay near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly
in such conditions, stay off the rocks.</instruction>
