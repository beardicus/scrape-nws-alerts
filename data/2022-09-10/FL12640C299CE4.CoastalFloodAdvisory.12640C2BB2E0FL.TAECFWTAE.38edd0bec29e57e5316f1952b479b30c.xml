* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding is
expected. For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip
currents.
* WHERE...Coastal Franklin County.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 6 PM EDT this
evening. Peak water levels are expected around the time of high

Rip Current Risk, through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Peak water levels of 1.5 ft to 2.5 ft above ground
level are expected around the time of high tide. At these levels
boat ramps are flooded, along with docks along the water front.
Minor overwash is expected along Alligator Point Road. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
