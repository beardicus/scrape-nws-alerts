<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued September 10 at 11:43AM PDT until September 11 at 2:00AM PDT by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 AM PDT
SUNDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 AM PDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, shallow flooding of sea
water is expected. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking
waves of 5 to 8 feet with dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...Catalina and Santa Barbara Islands.
* WHEN...Until 2 AM PDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of sea water is likely around the time of
high tide. Areas of concern include vulnerable low-lying
coastal areas such as Pebbly Beach Yard, coastal walkways, and
beach areas. Significant damage to roads or structures is NOT
expected. There is an increased risk for ocean drowning. Rip
currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Large
breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and
rocks, and capsize small boats near shore.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Coastal Flooding will be most hazardous
during high tide. A high tides of 6.5 to 7.0 feet is expected
this morning around 10 AM, and a high tide of 7.0 to 7.5 feet
is expected this evening around 9 PM.</description>
<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Do
NOT drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.
Remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions, or stay
near occupied lifeguard towers. Stay off rock jetties, as they
can be deadly locations in such conditions.</instruction>
