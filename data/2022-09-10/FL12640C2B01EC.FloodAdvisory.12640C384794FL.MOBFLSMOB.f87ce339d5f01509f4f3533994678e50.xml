* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
Ponding of water in urban or other areas is occurring or is

is poor will likely see minor flooding over the next hour as a
slow moving thunderstorm moves across the area. This area saw 4 to
6 inches of rain last night and is already saturated and if the
storm lingers then a warning may be necessary.

thunderstorms. Minor flooding is ongoing or expected to begin
shortly in the advisory area. Up to 1 inch of rain has
fallen.

over the area. This additional rain will result in minor
flooding.
