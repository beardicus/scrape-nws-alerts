<headline>Special Weather Statement issued September 10 at 7:58PM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...AN AREA OF HEAVY RAIN WITH INTENSE LIGHTNING WILL IMPACT
SOUTHWESTERN MECKLENBURG...SOUTH CENTRAL GASTON AND YORK COUNTIES
UNTIL 830 PM EDT...
At 758 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicated the leading edge of an area of
heavy rain with intense lightning along a line extending from 4 miles
south of York to 9 miles north of Lancaster, and moving north at 15
mph.
Locations to be impacted include...
Rock Hill, York, Gastonia, Southwest Charlotte, Fort Mill, South
Gastonia, Tega Cay, Clover, Newport and Lesslie.
In addition to intense lightning, very heavy rainfall rates up to 2
inches per hour will be possible in these areas.</description>
<instruction>The combination of gusty winds and saturated soil conditions will
cause scattered trees and power lines to fall. Seek shelter inside an
interior room.
Torrential rainfall may flood areas with poor drainage, such as
ditches and underpasses. Avoid these areas and do not cross flooded
roads. Water levels of small streams may also rise rapidly. Seek
higher ground if threatened by flood waters.
Frequent lightning is occurring with these storms. If outdoors, try
to get indoors or into a hard topped vehicle. Otherwise, stay away
from open areas and isolated high objects such as trees. When
indoors, stay away from windows and doors and avoid using wired
electronic devices. Do not take a shower or bath. Try to unplug
unnecessary appliances before the storms approach.</instruction>
