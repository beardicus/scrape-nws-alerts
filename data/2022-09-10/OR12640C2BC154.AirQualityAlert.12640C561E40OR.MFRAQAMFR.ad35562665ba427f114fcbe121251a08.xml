<headline>Air Quality Alert issued September 10 at 3:37PM PDT  by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL AT LEAST 5 PM PDT MONDAY...
The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality extended its air
quality advisory Saturday, Sept. 10, for Curry, Douglas, Jackson,
Josephine, Klamath, Lake, counties due to smoke from fires across
Oregon and central Idaho.
DEQ expects the air quality advisory to last until at least Monday,
Sept. 12. The advisory for Coos County ends today. DEQ and partner
agencies will continue to monitor smoke in the area.
Smoke levels can change rapidly depending on weather. Check current
conditions on the Oregon Smoke Information Blog, DEQ’s Air Quality
Index, or by downloading the free OregonAIR app on your smartphone.
Smoke can irritate the eyes and lungs and worsen some medical
conditions. People most at risk include infants and young children,
people with heart or lung disease, older adults and pregnant people.
Protect yourself and your family when smoke levels are high:
* Stay inside if possible. Keep windows and doors closed. If it’s
too hot, run air conditioning on recirculate or consider moving to
a cooler location. Avoid strenuous outdoor activity. Use high-
efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters in indoor ventilation
systems or portable air purifiers. Or create your own air purifying
filter by following these instructions. Be aware of smoke in your
area and avoid places with the highest levels. When air quality
improves to moderate or healthy (yellow or green on the Air Quality
Index), open windows and doors to air out homes and businesses. If
you have a breathing plan for a medical condition, be sure to
follow it and keep any needed medications refilled. Cloth, dust and
surgical masks don’t protect from the harmful particles in smoke.
N95 or P100 respirators approved by NIOSH may offer protection, but
they must be properly selected and worn. Select a NIOSH-approved
respirator with a N, R or P alongside the number 95, 99 or 100.
Learn how to put on and use a respirator. Respirators won’t work
for children as they don’t come in children’s sizes. People with
heart or lung conditions should consult their health care provider
before wearing a respirator.

for “Wildfire Related Clean Air Shelters.” Or call 2 1 1 any time
or day.</description>
