<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM PDT THIS AFTERNOON...
An Air Quality Advisory remains in effect for Lake, Klamath,
Josephine, Douglas, Jackson, Coos, and Curry counties until 5 PM PDT
Saturday.
Wildfires burning in the region combined with forecast conditions
will cause air quality levels to fluctuate to unhealthy levels, at
times through 5 PM PDT this afternoon.
Smoke levels can change rapidly depending on weather. Check current
conditions on the Oregon Smoke Information Blog, DEQ’s Air Quality
Index, or by downloading the free OregonAIR app on your smartphone.
- Smoke can irritate the eyes and lungs and worsen some medical
conditions. People most at risk include infants and young
children, people with heart or lung disease, older adults, and
pregnant people.
- Protect yourself and your family when smoke levels are high by:
- Staying inside if possible. Keep windows and doors closed. If it’s
too hot, run air conditioning on recirculate or consider moving to
a cooler location. Avoid strenuous outdoor activity.
- Use a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter in indoor
ventilation systems or portable air purifiers.
- Be aware of smoke in your area and avoid places with the highest
levels.
- If you have a breathing plan for a medication condition, be sure
to follow it and keep any needed medications refilled.
