<senderName>NWS Midland-Odessa (Western Texas and Southeastern New Mexico)</senderName>
<headline>Flood Warning issued September 10 at 7:53PM CDT until further notice by NWS Midland-Odessa</headline>
<description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in Texas...
Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch affecting Brewster County.
Rio Grande below Presidio 5SE affecting Presidio County.
Rio Grande at Presidio International Bridge affecting Presidio
County.
Rio Grande at Boquillas affecting Brewster County.
Rio Grande at Castolon affecting Brewster County.
For the Rio Grande...including Presidio 6WNW, Presidio International
Bridge, Presidio 5SE, Castolon, Johnson Ranch, Boquillas, Dryden
16S, Terlingua 8S...Moderate flooding is forecast.
...FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE...
* WHAT...Moderate flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch.
* WHEN...Until further notice.
* IMPACTS...At 12.0 feet (3.7 meters), the river reaches bankfull,
minor lowland flooding occurs, and no significant damage is
expected.
At 15.0 feet (4.6 meters), flood stage is reached.  Moderate
lowland flooding begins.  Roads that lead to Cottonwood Campground
and River Road may flood.  Stages are practically synonymous with
the gage at Cottonwood Campground at Castolon (CSTT2), and
therefore represent the reach from Santa Elena Canyon through
Cottonwood Campground, where damage may occur.  Cattle also graze
in the lowlands, and may be threatened.
At 19.0 feet (5.8 meters), the river reaches major flood stage.
Flooding begins to occur upstream in Cottonwood Campground at
Castolon, as stages at each location are practically synonymous.
Moderate lowland flooding begins at the gage site, but no damage
occurs.  The gage is inaccessible, as River Road is impassable at
several locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 9:15 AM CDT Saturday the stage was 13.4 feet (4.1 meters).
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above flood stage
early Monday morning and continue rising to 17.4 feet (5.3
meters) early Thursday morning. Additional rises are possible
thereafter.
- Flood stage is 15.0 feet (4.6 meters).
- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of
15.7 feet (4.8 meters) on 09/03/2022.
