<description>...Showers and Thunderstorms Capable of Heavy Rain and Areas of
Blowing Dust through Early Evening...
* Scattered showers and thunderstorms are developing this
afternoon across the eastern Sierra in Mono County and
extending into Mineral County.
* Increased moisture associated with the remnants of former
Tropical Storm Kay may allow storms to produce localized areas
of heavy rainfall, which may yield flash flooding potential for
burn scar locations or in areas of steep terrain.
* While precipitation amounts around a quarter inch are possible
with any shower or storm, heavier cores will be capable of up to
0.50&quot; to 1.00&quot;/hr rainfall rates on the high end due to the
increased instability and moisture.
* Strong outflow winds with gusts to 40 mph may produce blowing
dust across western Nevada late this afternoon into the evening.
Visibility could be reduced to less than 1 mile at times
downwind of dry sinks.
* Be sure to keep a close eye on the weather, have multiple ways
to receive weather warnings and be prepared to take shelter if
you are outdoors.</description>
