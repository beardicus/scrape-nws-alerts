<description>...LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL POSSIBLE ...
This Hydrologic Outlook is for Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan in
the Mariana Islands.
A tropical circulation has formed a little north of the CNMI. This
system is forecast to slowly strengthen, as it gradually heads
off to the west, while placing the Marianas and the CNMI in a
monsoon flow for the middle to end of the upcoming week. There
remains some disagreement in timing, location, and duration of the
heavier rainfall potential amongst the various model forecasts.
Any stronger shower or thunderstorm may also produce strong wind
gusts.
Timing: Wednesday afternoon through Friday afternoon.
Locations: The Mariana Islands
Amounts: Northern CNMI     - 5 to 8 inches
Tinian and Saipan - 3 to 5 inches
Guam and Rota     - 2 to 4 inches
Note: All locations may see locally higher rainfall totals
Should this occur as forecast, urban and small stream flooding
would be a possibility.
Closely monitor this developing situation in the event watches,
advisories, or warnings are needed. Forecasts will likely change in
the next few days.
Make sure nearby storm drains are not clogged, especially for
low-lying or flood-prone areas.</description>
