SUNDAY EVENING FOR THE EASTERN PLAINS DUE TO STRONG WINDS, LOW
RELATIVE HUMIDITY AND AN UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
.After a break from the winds today, southwesterly winds will
strengthen on Sunday. Combined with exceptionally dry conditions
and an unstable atmosphere, critical fire weather conditions will
return for western and central areas Sunday. It is unclear at
this time how far east a dryline will advance and the eastern
plains may not experience critical fire weather conditions on
Sunday due to Gulf moisture holding on and the potential for
wetting storms. Another round of critical fire weather is likely
Monday afternoon across all of the east.
