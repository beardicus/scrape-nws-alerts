<headline>High Wind Warning issued April 30 at 2:44AM CDT until April 30 at 4:00PM CDT by NWS Goodland</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 PM MDT /4 PM CDT/
THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Northwest winds at 30 to 45 mph with gusts up to 65 mph.
* WHERE...Majority of the Tri-State area, mainly along and north
of Highway 40.
* WHEN...Until 3 PM MDT /4 PM CDT/ this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Hazardous travel conditions, especially on major
routes such as Interstate 70, Highway 385, Highway 83, and
Highway 283. Wind of this magnitude may also down trees, power
lines, and damage property.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The strongest winds are anticipated to
occur between 3 AM and 12 PM MDT.</description>
<instruction>Expect difficult travel conditions along the Interstate 70
corridor in eastern Colorado and northwest Kansas today,
especially this morning. Watch for objects blowing across the
roadway and into your path. Keep a safe distance from cars in
adjacent lanes as strong gusts could suddenly push a vehicle
outside its lane of travel. Take extra care in high-profile
vehicles such as a truck, van, or SUV, or when towing a trailer,
as these are more prone to be pushed or even flipped by high
winds.</instruction>
