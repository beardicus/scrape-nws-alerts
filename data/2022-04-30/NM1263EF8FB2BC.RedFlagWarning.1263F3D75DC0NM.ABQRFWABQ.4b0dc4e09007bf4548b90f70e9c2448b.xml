.After a break from strong winds today, south to southwest winds
will strengthen on Sunday. Combined with exceptionally dry
conditions and an unstable atmosphere, critical fire weather
conditions will return for western and central areas Sunday. Low
level moisture will make a run into eastern NM tonight but it`s
uncertain how far to the east it will be driven Sunday afternoon
so portions of the plains near the TX border may see minimum
humidities greater than 15 percent, as well as localized wetting
storms. Drier activity with variable gusty winds is possible along
the Pecos Valley. Another round of critical fire weather is
likely Monday afternoon along and east of the central mountain
chain.
