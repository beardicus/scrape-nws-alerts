<description>...More wind with light showers on the way...
-Today into Sunday-
A quick-moving system will sweep through the Sierra and western
Nevada today into Sunday bringing breezy southwest to west winds
today, and northerly winds Sunday. The winds will result in choppy
lake conditions this afternoon and early evening and it may be a
good idea to save lake recreation for another day. Localized areas
of blowing dust are possible downwind of the Carson Sink, possibly
affecting I-80, US-95, and US-50.
Light showers and isolated thunderstorms will form near the
Oregon border today, with showers spreading south along the I-80
corridor overnight. A few showers may linger early Sunday morning
near and east of US-95. Liquid totals will be minimal -- a few
sprinkles up to a tenth of an inch.
-Windy Monday-
Yup, more wind on Monday, and winds will be stronger. Confidence
is high for widespread southwest to northwest wind gusts 35 to 50
mph, locally higher in wind prone locations. There is potential
for downslope enhancement of the wind gusts, which would boost the
peak wind gusts for canyons along the US-395/I-580 corridor from
Susanville south to Mammoth.
Travel impacts are nearly certain with high profile vehicle
restrictions and rough air for aviators. Be sure to check with
NDOT/CalTrans for road conditions and with your airline for flight
details. Choppy lakes and possible ski area impacts are also
expected, along with more widespread areas of blowing dust into
the central Nevada Basin and Range.
While a few light showers are possible near the Oregon border on
Monday, elsewhere conditions will be very dry along with the
gusty winds, leading to increased fire weather danger. Avoid
activities which could ignite a spark.</description>
