<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR SNOWMELT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by snowmelt continues to be possible.
* WHERE...The following area, Chilkat River.
* WHEN...Through Sunday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Backyards along the Chilkat River in the village of
Klukwan may start to flood and impact some smoke houses.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Unusually warm daytime temperatures into the 70s and 80s
through the weekend may accelerate snow and glacier ice melt
in the Chilkat River basin. River levels are expected to rise
to the point that water may start to cause issues for areas
around Klukwan by Saturday morning. Highest water levels are
expected Saturday morning and Sunday morning. There is
uncertainty on how high the river will get with the
possibilities ranging from the bankfull conditions to minor
flooding in some areas.
- If you live near or along Chilkat River stay alert and be
prepared to take action.</description>
