<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR SNOWMELT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH SUNDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by snowmelt continues to be possible.
* WHERE...The following area, Taiya River.
* WHEN...Through Sunday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...The Taiya River may rise out of their banks and start to
inundate the first few miles of the Chilkoot trail to ankle depth.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Unusually warm daytime temperatures into the 70s and 80s
through the weekend may accelerate snow and glacier ice melt
in the Taiya River basin. River levels are expected to rise
to the point that water may start to cause issues for the
Chilkoot Trail by Saturday morning causing minor flooding.
Highest water levels are expected Saturday morning and Sunday
morning. There is uncertainty on how high the river will get
with the possibilities ranging from bankfull conditions to
minor flooding in some areas.
- If you live near or along the Taiya River stay alert and be
prepared to take action.</description>
