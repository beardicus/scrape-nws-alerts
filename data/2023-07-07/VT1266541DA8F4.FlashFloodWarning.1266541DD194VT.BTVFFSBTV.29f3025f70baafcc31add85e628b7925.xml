<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 445 PM EDT THIS
AFTERNOON FOR CENTRAL CALEDONIA COUNTY...
At 341 PM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated
thunderstorms producing heavy rain across the warned area. Between
1.5 and 2.5 inches of rain have fallen. Additional rainfall amounts
up to 0.5 inches are possible in the warned area. Flash flooding is
ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar and automated gauges.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,
highways, streets and underpasses as well as other poor
drainage and low-lying areas.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
St. Johnsbury, Lyndon, Danville, Walden, Barnet, Stannard, Peacham,
Wheelock, North Danville, Greenbank Hollow, West Danville and East
Peacham.
Most affected areas are in the headwaters of the Passumpsic River
Basin, particularly in the Danville and North Danville areas and
Sleepers River watershed. These small tributaries will rise rapidly
in the next few hours, leading to a higher threat of flash flooding.
