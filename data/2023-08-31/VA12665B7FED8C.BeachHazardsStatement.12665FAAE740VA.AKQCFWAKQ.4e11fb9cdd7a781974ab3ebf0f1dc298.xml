<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued August 31 at 3:47AM EDT until August 31 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Wakefield</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS
EVENING...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IS CANCELLED...
* WHAT...Dangerous rip currents and large battering waves
expected.
* WHERE...Accomack County.
* WHEN...Through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Breaking waves of 4 to 6 ft through tonight will
result in rough surf conditions and a high risk of rip currents.</description>
<instruction>Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
