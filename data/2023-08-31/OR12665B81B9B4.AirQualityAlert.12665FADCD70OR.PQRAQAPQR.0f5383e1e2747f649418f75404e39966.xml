<description>...AIR QUALITY ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON PDT FRIDAY...
The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality and Southwest Clean
Air Agency have issued an Air Quality Advisory for Multnomah and
Clark Counties, which is in effect until midday Friday.
Smoke associated with the Camp Creek Fire near Mount Hood will cause
air quality to reach unhealthy levels at times through midday Friday.
Smoke can irritate the eyes and lungs and worsen some medical
conditions. People most at risk include infants and young children,
people with heart or lung disease, older adults, and pregnant people.
Protect yourself and your family when smoke levels are high:
- Stay inside if possible. Keep windows and doors closed.
- Avoid strenuous outdoor activity.
- Use high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters in indoor
ventilation systems or portable air purifiers.
- Be aware of smoke in your area and avoid places with the highest
levels of smoke. Latest conditions can be found at www.airnow.gov.
- When air quality improves to moderate or healthy (yellow or green
on the Air Quality Index), open windows and doors to air out homes
and businesses.
- If you have a breathing plan or a medical condition, be sure to
follow it and keep any needed medications refilled.
Cloth, dust and surgical masks don`t protect from the harmful
particles in smoke. N95 or P100 respirators approved by NIOSH may
offer protection, but they must be properly selected and worn. Select
a NIOSH-approved respirator with a N, R, or P alongside the number
95, 99, or 100. Learn how to put on and properly use a respirator.
Respirators won`t work for children as they don`t come in children`s
sizes. People with heart or lung conditions should consult their
health provider before wearing a respirator.
To find a place with cleaner air, visit 211info.org and search for
Wildfire Related Clean Air Shelters. Or call 211 at any time.
