SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Idalia has undergone post tropical transition and

evening. It will continue to track out to sea tonight though gusty
winds and some coastal flooding will continue to persist around the
Outer Banks and portions of Downeast Carteret as well as the Neuse,
Bay, Pamlico, and Pungo Rivers.
Inundation of 1-3 feet above ground is possible along the Neuse and
Pamlico Rivers and associated tributaries, as well as Core and
southern Pamlico Sounds as well the Outer Banks.
Dangerous marine conditions are expected for all offshore waters and
the Pamlico Sound, with strong winds and dangerous seas persisting
through tonight and creating treacherous conditions for mariners.
Localized ocean overwash is expected along Hatteras Island and the
Northern Outer Banks due to high surf. Stronger and more frequent rip
currents will also exist along area beaches.

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Remain safely sheltered until conditions improve. When going outside
be sure to stay away from downed power lines, hazardous debris and
flooded areas.
If your home or shelter was damaged, be alert to the smell of gas
leaks and be cautious around electrical wiring, broken glass, jagged
metal and wood, and protruding nails and screws.
Check to see if everyone in your group is OK. Administer first aid to
those who are injured. If possible, call 9 1 1 for any serious
injuries. Remember, it may be difficult for emergency responders to
arrive quickly.
Check in with your emergency points of contact. Let them know your
location and status. Keep conversations short and to the point. Do
not tie up communications systems.
Check on your neighbors. If necessary, help them connect with their
points of contact.
Allow extra time for emergency vehicles to reach you as they navigate
road hazards.
When entering areas that have been heavily damaged, bring along a
GPS-enabled device to help with street navigation. Do not drive on
roads that have been marked closed.
Do not go sightseeing within impacted communities. Sightseers
interfere with the emergency work of first responders.
When inspecting damage, use flashlights rather than candles or flamed
lanterns. Be aware of sparks that can ignite natural gas or other
leaking flammables.
Do not go up on your roof until the weather conditions are safe.
Ladders can be slippery in the rain and unexpected wind gusts can
blow you off the roof.
When clearing out fallen trees, be careful with chainsaws and axes.
Always wear protective gear and keep others at a safe distance.
Leaning trees and those which have fallen on roofs or power lines can
be especially dangerous. If you are not in good health or unsure
about what you are doing, have someone with tree cutting experience
do the job. Never cut trees without a partner.
If using a generator, avoid carbon monoxide poisoning by following
instructions provided by the manufacturer. Operate your generator in
a well-ventilated space outside of your living area and away from
open doors and windows.
Be alert for any lingering wind gusts which could take down weakened
trees and/or power lines, collapse damaged structures, or cause
flying debris.
Be alert for potential flooding from rising rivers and streams which
may have yet to crest. Remain informed of the latest river forecasts
and heed any flood watches and warnings.
Be alert for flooded roads which could be compromised or littered
with debris. Avoid travel until water levels subside and roads have
been cleared. Do not drive through places where flood waters cover
the road. Turn around, don`t drown!
