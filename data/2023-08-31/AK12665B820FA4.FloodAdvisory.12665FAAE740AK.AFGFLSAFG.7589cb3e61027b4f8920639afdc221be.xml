<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 31 at 1:45PM AKDT  by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON AKDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...The Tanana River from Nenana to Old Minto
* WHEN...Until noon AKDT Monday.
* IMPACTS...The Tanana River is bankfull from Nenana to Old Minto
with minor flooding occurring or expected in some low lying areas.
The lower Nenana River at Nenana is also bankfull and may
experience minor flooding. As water levels gradually rise into the
weekend, areas around Nenana will likely see water going overbank
into low lying areas near the river, including the boat landing on
the Nenana River. Additionally, rising groundwater may start to
impact crawl spaces or pond in town. Minor flooding or bankfull
conditions are expected to persist into early next week.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 130 PM AKDT, heavy rain that fell over the south slopes of
the Alaska Range since last weekend is causing high water on
the Tanana River and Nenana River. Additional heavy rain in
the Alaska Range and in the Tanana Valley over the next few
days will result in more runoff into the Tanana and Nenana
Rivers into the weekend.
- For those recreating or hunting on the Tanana and Nenana
Rivers, all gravel bars will be covered with water, debris
will be in the river, along with increased erosion. Be
cautious of rising water levels if you plan to park your
vehicle near the river while out on your boat.
- For Tanana River at Nenana:
At 12:15pm Thu, the stage was 12.55 feet.
Flood Stage is 12.5 feet.
Forecast: A crest around 13.2 feet is expected around 10:00pm
Sunday.

alert and be prepared to take action.</description>
