SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Conditions continue to improve across southeast Georgia and the South
Carolina Lowcountry as Tropical Storm Idalia moves away from the area.
Breezy conditions will continue through early morning, especially
along the immediate coast where gusts up to 30 to 35 mph are possible.
Most of the rain has ended, though a few fast moving showers could
move into the area through early morning.
Some areas continue dealing with residual standing water and flooding.
Remember to never drive through a flooded roadway - Turn Around, Don`t
Drown!
Over the next few days, many local rivers and streams will experience
significant rises as water from heavy rain moves downstream. Remain
informed of the latest river forecasts and heed any flood warnings.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* SURGE:
Little to no additional surge impacts expected.
- Community officials are now assessing the extent of actual
surge impacts accordingly.
- Emergency work crews are restoring essential community
infrastructure as necessary.
- If you have an emergency dial 9 1 1.
Elsewhere across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia,
little to no impact is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
RECOVERY PHASE - Do not enter evacuated areas until officials have
given the all clear to return.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
If your home or shelter was damaged, be alert to the smell of gas
leaks and be cautious around electrical wiring, broken glass, jagged
metal and wood, and protruding nails and screws.
Do not attempt to return to evacuated areas until local authorities
give the all clear. Allow time for officials to inspect bridges and
overpasses and to mark washed-out roads.
Do not drive on roads that have been marked closed or are flooded.
Do not go sightseeing within impacted communities. Sightseers
interfere with the emergency work of first responders.
When inspecting damage, use flashlights rather than candles or flamed
lanterns. Be aware of sparks that can ignite natural gas or other
leaking flammables.
When clearing out fallen trees, be careful with chainsaws and axes.
Always wear protective gear and keep others at a safe distance.
Leaning trees and those which have fallen on roofs or power lines can
be especially dangerous. If you are not in good health or unsure
about what you are doing, have someone with tree cutting experience
do the job. Never cut trees without a partner.
If using a generator, avoid carbon monoxide poisoning by following
instructions provided by the manufacturer. Operate your generator in
a well-ventilated space outside of your living area and away from
open doors and windows.
Be alert for any lingering wind gusts which could take down weakened
trees and/or power lines, collapse damaged structures, or cause
flying debris.
Be alert for potential flooding from rising rivers and streams which
may have yet to crest. Remain informed of the latest river forecasts
and heed any flood watches and warnings.
Be alert for flooded roads which could be compromised or littered
with debris. Avoid travel until water levels subside and roads have
been cleared. Do not drive through places where flood waters cover
the road. Turn around, don`t drown!
