<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued August 31 at 3:59AM EDT until August 31 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM EDT FRIDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 8 AM EDT THIS
MORNING THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 7 to
10 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards Statement,
dangerous rip currents, large breaking waves expected, and
strong longshore currents in the surf zone.
* WHERE...Core Banks beaches.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 AM EDT Friday. For
the Beach Hazards Statement, from 8 AM EDT this morning
through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore
break can throw a swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom
causing neck and back injuries. Strong longshore currents will
create dangerous swimming conditions.</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
