- All watches and warnings have been canceled
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None

SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Idalia will continue to push farther offshore as
conditions improve over the local area. Gusty winds will continue, but
below tropical storm force.
Over the next few days, many local rivers and streams will experience
significant rises as water from heavy rain moves downstream. Remain
informed of the latest river forecasts and heed any flood warnings.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time across southeast
North Carolina and northeast South Carolina.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
If your home or shelter was damaged, be alert to the smell of natural
gas leaks and cautious around exposed electrical wiring, broken glass,
jagged metal and wood, and protruding nails and screws.
Check to see if everyone in your group is OK. Administer first aid to
those who are injured. Call 9 1 1 for any serious injuries. Remember,
it may be more difficult for emergency responders to arrive quickly
in the time period immediately following the storm.
When clearing out fallen trees, be careful with chain saws and axes.
Always wear protective gear and keep others at a safe distance. Use
these tools according to operating manuals and safety instruction.
Leaning trees and those which have fallen on roof tops can be
especially challenging. If you are not in good health or unsure about
what you are doing, have someone else with tree cutting experience do
the job. Never cut trees without a partner.
