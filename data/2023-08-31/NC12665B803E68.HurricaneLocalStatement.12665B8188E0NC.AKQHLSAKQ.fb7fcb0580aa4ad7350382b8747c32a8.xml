THURSDAY NIGHT**
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Coastal Flood Warning has been issued for Eastern Currituck
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Eastern Currituck and
Western Currituck
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 370 miles south-southwest of Ocean City MD or about 250
miles south-southwest of Norfolk VA
- 33.6N 78.0W
- Storm Intensity 60 mph
- Movement East-northeast or 75 degrees at 21 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Idalia has moved just offshore of Myrtle Beach,
South Carolina early this morning and will continue to track east
today. Idalia will make its closest approach as it tracks just to
the south of Cape Lookout.
Tropical storm force wind gusts are expected to develop this morning
for coastal and inland Currituck County as well as the Currituck
Sound. A Tropical Storm Warning remains in effect for these areas.
Additionally, the pressure gradient between Idalia`s circulation and
high pressure to the north will result in strong winds along the
coast, even outside of the Tropical Storm Warning area. Strong winds
could lead to downed trees and scattered power outages. Strong
onshore winds are expected to lead to areas of minor to moderate
coastal flooding.
Heavy rain bands from Idalia will continue to move across the area
through early this evening. There will likely be a sharp rainfall
gradient across the local area as high pressure over the Great Lakes
builds south and east today. 2 to 4 inches of rainfall is forecast
near and south of the Virginia North Carolina border. This includes
what has already fallen. Locally higher amounts are possible,
especially along and south of the Virginia North Carolina border
where a Flood Watch remains in effect.
Dangerous marine conditions are expected today into early Friday due
to the strong winds. Seas build to 7 to 12 feet on today and remain
elevated into Saturday.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
CURRITUCK COUNTY NC, and coastal areas of SOUTHEAST VIRGINIA.
Potential impacts in this area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, especially if soils are saturated. Some roadway signs
will sustain damage.
- A few roads will be impassable from debris. Hazardous driving
conditions on bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across CENTRAL AND EASTERN VIRGINIA...AND THE LOWER
MARYLAND EASTERN SHORE, little to no impact is anticipated.
* SURGE:
Protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across SOUTHEAST VIRGINIA and NORTHEAST NORTH CAROLINA.
Potential impacts in this area include:
- Widespread storm surge flooding of vulnerable areas will result
in an elevated threat of property damage to homes and
businesses near the waterfront and shoreline.
- Sections of low-lying vulnerable roads, parking lots and
property will likely become flooded. Driving conditions could
become dangerous in places where flooding covers the road.
- Moderate to severe beach erosion is likely, including heavy
surf possibly breaching dunes, especially in vulnerable
locations. Strong and dangerous rip currents are likely.
- Minor to moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and
piers is likely. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
Elsewhere across CENTRAL AND EASTERN VIRGINIA...AND THE LOWER
MARYLAND EASTERN SHORE, little to no impact is anticipated.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible
significant impacts across NORTHEAST NORTH CAROLINA. Potential
impacts include:
- Flooding from heavy rainfall may prompt evacuations and rescues
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen, with swift
currents, and overspill their banks. Small streams, creeks, and
ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures and/or weaken
foundations. Some areas may experience areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures are expected.
Protect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across FAR SOUTHEAST VIRGINIA.
* TORNADOES:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time across CENTRAL AND
EASTERN VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST NORTH CAROLINA...AND THE LOWER MARYLAND
EASTERN SHORE.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to stay inside and away from windows. Listen for
updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Keep a battery-
powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.
Keep your cell phone charged and in power-saving mode. If you lose
power, use it sparingly and mainly for personal emergencies and
check-ins.
Rapidly rising flood waters are deadly. If you are in a flood-prone
area, consider moving to higher ground. Never drive through a flooded
roadway. Remember, turn around don`t drown!
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
