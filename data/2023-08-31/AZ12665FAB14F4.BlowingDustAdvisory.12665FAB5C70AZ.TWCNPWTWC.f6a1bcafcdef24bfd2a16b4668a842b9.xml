<headline>Blowing Dust Advisory issued August 31 at 6:17PM MST until August 31 at 8:00PM MST by NWS Tucson</headline>
<description>...BLOWING DUST ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM MST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Strong thunderstorms this afternoon and evening will be
capable of producing areas of dense blowing dust, reducing
visibility between one quarter mile and one mile.
* WHERE...Western Pima County, Tohono O&amp;#039;odham Nation, Tucson
Metro Area and South Central Pinal County.
* WHEN...Until 8 PM MST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Thunderstorms will produce strong thunderstorm
outflow winds capable of producing dense blowing dust this
afternoon and evening...with a potential for Haboob formation
between Tucson and Phoenix. Hazardous driving conditions due
to a rapidly reduced visibility in blowing dust is possible,
especially along Interstate 10 between Tucson and Phoenix and
Highway 86 west of Tucson. Strong and gusty thunderstorm
outflow winds will likely suspend dust into the air that
people and animals breathe. Individuals with heart disease and
respiratory sensitivities may want to reduce their level of
exertion to limit the dust they breathe into their lungs...
especially if they are near dust- prone locations. Those most
at risk may feel better if they avoid outside exercise today...
keeping windows and doors closed to help reduce exposure.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
Motorists should not drive into an area of blowing dust.
Remember, Pull Aside, Stay Alive.</description>
