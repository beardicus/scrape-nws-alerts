<description>...STRONG WINDS IN THE ANCHORAGE AREA LATE THIS MORNING INTO
FRIDAY...
Southeast winds are expected to rapidly increase by late morning
and bring in gusts of 40 to 50 mph across the Anchorage bowl this
afternoon. Gusts along the hillside may reach the 60 to 70 mph
range during the afternoon. Winds will then shift more south-
southwest but remain gusty in the 25 to 35 mph range from this
evening through Friday afternoon or evening.
People are urged to secure loose objects that could be blown
around or damaged by the wind. Prepare for the possibility of
power outages. Use caution if you must drive, especially if in a
high profile vehicle.
