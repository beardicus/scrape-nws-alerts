<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...The Tanana River from Old Minto to Manley Hot Springs
* WHEN...Through Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...The Tanana River is near or at bankfull from Old Minto
to Manley Hot Springs. As water levels gradually rise into the
weekend, minor flooding is possible of low-lying areas near the
river. Water levels will remain high into early next week.
For those recreating or hunting on the Tanana and Nenana Rivers, all
gravel bars will be covered with water, debris will be in the river,
along with increased erosion. Be cautious of rising water levels if
you plan to park your vehicle near the river while out on your boat.
A Flood Advisory is currently in effect until Noon Monday from
Nenana to Old Minto. Please see that product for more details.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Heavy rain that fell over the Alaska Range since last weekend
is causing high water on the Tanana River. Additional heavy
rain in the Alaska Range and in the Tanana Valley over the
next few days will result in more runoff into the Tanana and
Nenana Rivers into the weekend.

to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
