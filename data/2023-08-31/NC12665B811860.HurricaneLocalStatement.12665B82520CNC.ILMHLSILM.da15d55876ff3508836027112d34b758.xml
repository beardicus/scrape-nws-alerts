SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Idalia will continue to push farther offshore today.
The flooding rain and tornado threats have come to an end, but the
threat for gusty winds continues. Ongoing gusty winds and saturated
soils may lead to some downed trees and power lines.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the wind event are continuing across coastal
areas north of Cape Fear. Remain well sheltered from hazardous wind
having possible limited impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes is possible. Unsecured lightweight objects may be
blown about.
- Some large limbs may break from trees. A few shallow rooted or
weak trees may snap or be knocked down. Some fences and roadway
signs damaged.
- A few roads may become impassable due to debris, particularly
within urban or heavily wooded locations. Hazardous driving
conditions are possible, especially for high profile vehicles
on bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages are possible.
Elsewhere across southeast North Carolina and northeast South
Carolina, little to no impact is anticipated.
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the surge event are continuing across coastal
areas north of Cape Fear. Remain well away from locally hazardous surge
having possible limited impacts. If realized, these impacts include:
- Localized inundation and minor over-wash is possible, mainly
along immediate shorelines and other vulnerable low-lying areas
along the coast. Low spots along waterways and tidal creeks may
also be impacted.
- Some portions of near-shore roads and parking lots may become
covered by surge water. Driving conditions may become hazardous
in places where the surge covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion is possible, mainly in the vulnerable
locations along the ocean front.
- Minor damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers is
possible. A few small craft may break away from moorings if not
properly secured.
- Navigation may be difficult near inlets and waterways, as
navigational aids may be off station or missing.
Elsewhere across southeast North Carolina and northeast South
Carolina, little to no impact is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to remain safely sheltered from the storm. Stay inside
and away from windows. Listen for updates and be ready in case you
lose electrical power. Locate your battery powered radio and flashlight
from your Emergency Supplies Kit. Keep these items close.
Continue to keep your cell phone well charged for as long as
possible. If you lose power, use it more sparingly and mainly for
personal emergencies and check-ins.
