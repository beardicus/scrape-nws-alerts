<headline>Coastal Flood Statement issued August 31 at 6:09AM EDT until August 31 at 1:00PM EDT by NWS Caribou</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM THIS MORNING TO
1 PM THIS AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 4 to
6 feet in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Statement, minor
overwash is expected on vulnerable low lying roads along the
immediate coast.
* WHERE...Coastal Hancock and Coastal Washington Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 11 PM EDT this evening.
For the Coastal Flood Statement, from 10 AM this morning to 1
PM EDT this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...High dangerous surf and strong rip currents will make
for hazardous surf conditions. Large waves can present a danger
to people on rocks above the water. Stay away from rock outcrops
along the shoreline exposed to ocean waves, as waves can easily
sweep people into the cold ocean water. Water may begin to
approach the most vulnerable locations near the waterfront and
piers. Low-lying causeways will have some minor splash-over, but
inundation is not expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Minor overwash will be possible around the
time of high tide this morning around 1130 am.</description>
<instruction>Do not drive through flooded roadways.
A high surf advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in
the advisory area...producing rip currents and localized beach
erosion.</instruction>
