<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of unknown
depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Stay out of the surf. If you are ever caught in a rip current,
relax and float. Do not swim against the current. If possible,
swim in a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape,
face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
