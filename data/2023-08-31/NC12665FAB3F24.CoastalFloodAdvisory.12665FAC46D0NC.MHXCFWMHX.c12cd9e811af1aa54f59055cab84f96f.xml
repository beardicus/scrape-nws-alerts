<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 AM EDT
FRIDAY...
...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 AM EDT FRIDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH FRIDAY
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip
currents, large breaking waves, and strong longshore currents
in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to one
half foot of inundation above ground level in low-lying areas
near shorelines and tidal waterways. For the High Surf
Advisory, large breaking waves of 5 to 8 feet in the surf zone.
* WHERE...East Carteret County, and Ocracoke Island.
* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, through Friday
evening. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 5 AM EDT
Friday. For the High Surf Advisory, until 5 AM EDT Friday.
* IMPACTS...Up to 1 to 3 feet of inundation above ground level
is possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways resulting in a low threat of property damage. Some
roads and low lying property including parking lots, parks,
lawns, and homes adjacent to the waterfront will experience
shallow flooding. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions
and localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the
best swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Dangerous
shore break can throw a swimmer or surfer head first into the
bottom causing neck and back injuries. Strong longshore
currents will create dangerous swimming conditions.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.
Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.
Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
