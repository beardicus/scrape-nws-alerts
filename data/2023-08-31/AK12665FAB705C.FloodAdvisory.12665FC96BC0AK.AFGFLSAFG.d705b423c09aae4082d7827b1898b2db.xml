<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 31 at 7:51PM AKDT until September 02 at 4:00PM AKDT by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON AKDT SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...Tanana River from Delta Junction to Nenana, including
Fairbanks
* WHEN...Until noon AKDT Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding is occurring in low lying areas along the
Tanana River from Delta to Nenana. In Fairbanks, water from 1 to 3
feet deep is flowing over portions of Perkins Drive, Melanie Lane,
and Chief John Drive. Several driveways and yards are inundated
with water. Minor flooding is also occuring around the boat
landing at Whitestone Farms near Delta Junction. Minor flooding or
bankfull conditions are expected through Sunday.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 745 PM AKDT, heavy rain that fell over the south slopes of
the Alaska Range from Denali to the Alcan Border is causing
high water to flow down the Delta River and other rivers
draining the Alaska Range. This has caused the Tanana River
to rise to bankfull and overbank in some locations.
Additional heavy rain in the Alaska Range the next few days
will result in more runoff into the Tanana River into the
weekend.
- For those recreating or hunting on the Tanana River, all
gravel bars will be covered with water, debris will be in the
river, along with increased erosion. Be cautious of rising
water levels if you plan to park your vehicle near the river
while out on your boat.
- For Tanana River at Fairbanks:
At 7:15pm the stage was 25.13 feet.
Flood Stage is 24.5 feet.
Forecast: The river is expected to remain above flood stage
through Sunday.

prepared to take action.</description>
