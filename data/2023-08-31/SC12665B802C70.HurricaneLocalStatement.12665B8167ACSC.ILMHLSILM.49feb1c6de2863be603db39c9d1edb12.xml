SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Tropical Storm Idalia will continue to push offshore through
midday today. The flooding rain and tornado threats have come to an
end, but the threat for gusty winds continues. Ongoing gusty winds
and saturated soils may lead to some downed trees and power lines.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across
northeast South Carolina and southeast North Carolina. Remain well
sheltered from dangerous wind having possible significant impacts. If
realized, these impacts include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding, along with damage to porches
and awnings. A few buildings experiencing window, door, and
garage door failures. Damage to vulnerable structures such as
carports, sheds and mobile homes is possible.
- Large limbs will be down with several trees snapped or
uprooted. Several fences and roadway signs may become blown
over. Some roads may become impassable due to large debris
blocking the roadway, especially within urban or heavily wooded
locations. Some bridges, causeways, and elevated roads may be
impacted by high winds making driving on them hazardous.
- Scattered power and communications outages are possible, but
more prevalent in areas with above ground lines.
- Small craft that are not properly moored may break loose.
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across
coastal areas north of Cape Fear. Remain well away from locally
hazardous surge having possible limited impacts. If realized, these
impacts include:
- Localized inundation and minor over-wash is possible, mainly
along immediate shorelines and other vulnerable low-lying areas
along the coast. Low spots along waterways and tidal creeks may
also be impacted.
- Some portions of near-shore roads and parking lots may become
covered by surge water. Driving conditions may become hazardous
in places where the surge covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion is possible, mainly in the vulnerable
locations along the ocean front.
- Minor damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers is
possible. A few small craft may break away from moorings if not
properly secured.
- Navigation may be difficult near inlets and waterways, as
navigational aids may be off station or missing.
Elsewhere across southeast North Carolina and northeast South
Carolina, little to no impact is anticipated.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to remain safely sheltered from the storm. Stay
inside and away from windows. Listen for updates and be ready in case
you lose electrical power. Locate your battery powered radio and
flashlight from your Emergency Supplies Kit. Keep these items close.
Continue to keep your cell phone well charged for as long as
possible. If you lose power, use it more sparingly and mainly for
personal emergencies and check-ins.
