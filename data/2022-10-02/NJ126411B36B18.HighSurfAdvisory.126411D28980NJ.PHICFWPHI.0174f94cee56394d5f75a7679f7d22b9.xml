<instruction>Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. If
travel is required, do not drive around barricades or through
water of unknown depth.
Swimmers should remain out of the water due to dangerous surf
conditions. If caught in a rip current, relax and float. Don`t
swim against the current. If able, swim in a direction following
the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the shore and call or
wave for help.</instruction>
