<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Swimmers should remain out of the water due to dangerous surf
conditions. If caught in a rip current, relax and float. Don`t
swim against the current. If able, swim in a direction following
the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the shore and call or
wave for help.</instruction>
