For the High Surf Advisory, until 8 PM EDT Tuesday. For the
Beach Hazards Statement, through Tuesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Widespread flooding of vulnerable areas will result
in an elevated threat of property damage to homes and
businesses near the waterfront and shoreline. Water will be 1
to 2 feet above ground level in some areas resulting in a
sufficient depth to close numerous roads and threaten homes
and businesses. Flooding will extend inland from the
waterfront along tidal rivers and bays resulting in some road
closures and flooding of vehicles. Large breaking surf will
create dangerous swimming and surfing conditions, beach
erosion, and ocean overwash.
