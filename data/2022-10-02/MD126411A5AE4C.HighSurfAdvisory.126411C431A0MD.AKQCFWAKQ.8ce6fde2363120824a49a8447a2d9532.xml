EDT TUESDAY...
...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT TONIGHT TO 8 PM
EDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Warning, one to two feet of
inundation above ground level expected in low-lying areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways. For the High Surf Advisory,
large breaking waves of 8 to 12 feet expected in the surf
zone. For the Beach Hazards Statement, a high risk for rip currents.

8 PM EDT Monday. For the High Surf Advisory, from 2 PM this
afternoon to 6 AM EDT Tuesday. For the Beach Hazards
Statement, through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...Widespread flooding of vulnerable areas will
result in an elevated threat of property damage to homes and
businesses near the waterfront and shoreline. Water will be 1 to
2 feet above ground level in some areas resulting in a sufficient
depth to close numerous roads and threaten homes and businesses.
Flooding will extend inland from the waterfront along tidal
rivers and bays resulting in some road closures and flooding of
vehicles. Large breaking surf will create dangerous swimming and
surfing conditions, beach erosion, and ocean overwash.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.
