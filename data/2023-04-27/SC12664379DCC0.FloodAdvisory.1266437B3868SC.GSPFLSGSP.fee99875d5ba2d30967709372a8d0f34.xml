<headline>Flood Advisory issued April 27 at 10:40PM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 445 AM EDT FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Nuisance flooding caused by excessive rainfall is ongoing.
* WHERE...Central and southern Greenville County, South Carolina,
including the Greenville metropolitan area.
* WHEN...Until 445 AM EDT Friday.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to
drainages and streams including parks and greenways.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1024 PM EDT, Between 2.5 and 4 inches of rainfall have
fallen since early Thursday morning across central and
southern Greenville County, including the city of Greenville.
Excess runoff into area streams continue, causing significant
rises and isolated out-of-bank conditions across the area.
The heaviest rainfall has already occurred, but additional
periods of light to moderate rainfall are expected through
2am. Additional rain accumulations may prolong high stream
levels and cause flooding to persist.  Therefore, it will
take some time for area streams to crest and begin to recede
and the Flood Advisory will continue into the early morning
hours on Friday to allow conditions to improve.
The Reedy River at Hudson St crested at 9.31 feet at 8:18pm
and is now falling steadily.  The river is currently at 8.9
feet and will continue a gradual recession overnight as the
floodwave works downstream into southern Greenville County.
Additional rainfall may slow or reverse the recession
overnight so stream levels will continue to be monitored
closely.  Flooding of the lowest elevations of Unity Park
near the Reedy River and isolated flooding near Cleveland
Park along the Swamp Rabbit Trail will continue into the
early overnight hours.
High flows continue along Brushy and Gilder creeks feeding
the Enoree River as well and these streams are also nearing
crests.  Isolated out-of-bank conditions are possible,
flooding wooded and undeveloped areas.
- Some locations that may continue to experience nuisance
flooding include...
Greenville Downtown, Greenville Eastside, West Greenville,
Unity Park,  Reedy Falls Park, Cleveland Park, Mauldin,
Taylors, Simpsonville, Berea, Five Forks, Fountain Inn,
Welcome, Powdersville, and Piedmont</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.</instruction>
