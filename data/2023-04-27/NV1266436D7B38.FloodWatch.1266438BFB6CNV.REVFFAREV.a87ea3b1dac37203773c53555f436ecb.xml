Surprise Valley California. In western Nevada, Greater Lake Tahoe
Area, Greater Reno-Carson City-Minden Area and Mineral and
Southern Lyon Counties.
* WHEN...Through Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...Creeks and streams will be running high and fast.
Low-water crossings may be flooded. Minor mainstem flooding is

caution as water will be running high, fast, and potentially out
of banks for some creeks and streams. The water will be extremely
cold as well, quickly causing shock.
