<headline>Red Flag Warning issued April 27 at 1:15PM MDT until April 28 at 8:00PM MDT by NWS El Paso</headline>
<description>...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING FOR
THE LOWLANDS OF SOUTHWEST AND SOUTH CENTRAL NEW MEXICO, THE LOWER
AND MID ELEVATIONS OF THE GILA, AND EXTREME FAR WEST TEXAS...
.A passing storm system will push through southern New Mexico on
Friday bringing breezy to windy conditions with persisting dry
air. Temperatures will be seasonably warm. North to northwest
winds will be 20-25 MPH with gusts 30-35 MPH. In addition, a cold
front will push through the Sacramento mountains, and across
lowlands east of the Rio Grande through the day, shifting winds to
north and northeast over those areas. Minimum RH will be 7-12
percent across areas west of the advancing front. Behind the
front, cooler temperatures will help to raise relative humidity
above RFW criteria, but shifting winds will remain strong. Fire
weather conditions will improve through the evening as winds
subside and relative humidity rebounds above critical levels.
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM NOON TO 8 PM MDT FRIDAY FOR
STRONG WINDS AND DRY CONDITIONS...
The National Weather Service in El Paso Tx/Santa Teresa has
issued a Red Flag Warning, which is in effect from noon to 8 PM
MDT Friday.
* WIND...Northwest winds at 20 to 25 MPH and gusts 30 to 35 MPH.
* HUMIDITY...Minimum relative humidity 7 to 15 percent.
* COLD FRONT AND WIND SHIFTS...A cold front will push into the
region from the South Plains. Winds will turn northerly and
northeasterly through the day across the Sacramento mountains,
and the lowlands east of the Rio Grande.
* IMPACTS...any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly.
Outdoor burning is not recommended. Operational impacts due to
abrupt wind shifts should be considered due to the approaching
and passing cold front.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now, or will shortly. A combination of
strong winds, low relative humidity, and warm temperatures can
contribute to extreme fire behavior.</instruction>
