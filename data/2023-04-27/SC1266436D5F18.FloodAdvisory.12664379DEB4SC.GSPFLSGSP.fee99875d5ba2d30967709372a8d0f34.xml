<headline>Flood Advisory issued April 27 at 4:54PM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 1045 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Nuisance flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Central and southern Greenville County, South Carolina,
including the Greenville metropolitan area.
* WHEN...Until 1045 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to
drainages and streams including parks and greenways.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 453 PM EDT, Between 2 and 2.5 inches of rainfall have
fallen since early this morning across central and southern
Greenville County, including the city of Greenville.  This is
causing gradual excessive runoff into area drainages and
streams, including the Reedy River and West Brushy Creek in
Berea and Greenville; East Brushy Creek, Gilder Creek, and
the Enoree River near Mauldin, Five Forks, Taylors, and
Greer; and Grove Creek near Welcome and Piedmont.  Generally,
this runoff has not been enough to cause drainages and
streams to exceed their banks.
However, additional rainfall up to 1 inch is possible over
the next few hours as another round of rainfall moves over
Greenville County.  This rainfall will exacerbate ongoing
runoff and cause nuisance flooding along isolated reaches of
area drainages and streams through this evening, including
the Reedy River from Berea to Cleveland Park.
- The Reedy River at Hudson St is approaching 8 feet and is
rising steadily.  This will cause nuisance, shallow flooding
of isolated areas of the Swamp Rabbit Trail at Unity Park and
Cleveland Park.
Another round of heavy rainfall is possible later tonight,
generally after 10pm.  Given wet soils and elevated streams
from ongoing rainfall, any additional heavy rainfall,
especially over a short period of time, may induce flash
flooding over the area.  Please stay weather aware tonight in
case new Advisories or Warnings are issued.
- Some locations that may experience nuisance flooding
include...
Greenville Downtown, Greenville Eastside, West Greenville,
Unity Park,  Reedy Falls Park, Cleveland Park, Mauldin,
Taylors, Simpsonville, Berea, Five Forks, Fountain Inn,
Welcome, Powdersville, and Piedmont</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.</instruction>
