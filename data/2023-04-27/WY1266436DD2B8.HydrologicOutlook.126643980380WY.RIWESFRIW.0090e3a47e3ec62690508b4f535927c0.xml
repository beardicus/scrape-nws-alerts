<description>...Warming Temperatures this Weekend Increase Snow Melt and the
Potential for Flooding...
Temperatures steadily climb Saturday through Monday, which will melt
low elevation and foothill snow across far west Wyoming. High
temperatures in the valleys will range from 55 to 65 each afternoon
with a few readings nearing 70 by Monday.
These warm temperatures could result in significant melting of low
elevation snow given the deep snowpack that still exists in the
valleys. As of Thursday, April 27, many locations still had a snow
depth of 12 to 24 inches. Bedford and Star Valley Ranch reported the
greatest snow depth of 31 and 28 inches, respectively. Rapid melting
of this snowpack could quickly raise the water levels in smaller
tributary creeks and streams in the Bear, Salt, and Snake River
basins of Lincoln and Teton counties.
Now would be the time to clear snow, ice, and debris from culverts
and other flow paths to allow runoff to flow away from buildings and
other vulnerable infrastructure. This could include moving deep snow
away from the foundations of buildings, relocating equipment to
higher ground, and moving livestock out of poorly drained or
low-lying areas.
Stay tuned for the latest river forecasts. Remember, if you
encounter a flooded roadway, turn around don`t drown. You never
know what road conditions are hidden under the water.</description>
