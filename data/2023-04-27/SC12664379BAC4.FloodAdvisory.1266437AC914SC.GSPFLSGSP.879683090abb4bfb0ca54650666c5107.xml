<headline>Flood Advisory issued April 27 at 9:53PM EDT  by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 330 AM EDT FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Nuisance flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Central and southern Spartanburg County and northern
Laurens County, South Carolina.
* WHEN...Until 330 AM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to
drainages and streams, including parks, greenways and trails, golf
courses, boat-access areas, farmland, and woodlands.  Nuisance
flooding of poor-drainage areas, including underpasses and
intersections, is also expected.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 953 PM EDT, Storm-total rainfall of 2-4 inches has
occurred since Thursday morning, causing excessive runoff and
significant rises along area drainages and streams this
evening.  Some streams and associated tributaries may exceed
bankfull conditions over the next few hours, including
Lawsons Fork Creek and Fairforest Creek near Spartanburg, and
the North, Middle, and South Tyger rivers near Roebuck,
Reidville, Lyman, and Duncan, flooding adjacent low-lying
areas with shallow inundation.  Additionally, common flood-
prone areas in the Spartanburg metro, including railroad
underpasses, may experience ponding and brief closure.
Lawsons Fork Creek near Lake Forest Drive is rising steadily
and is expected to exceed the Action/Advisory Stage of 12
feet by 11pm.  The creek will continue to rise into the early
overnight hours and may approach 14 feet before cresting and
starting to recede early Friday morning.  Nuisance flooding
of adjacent low-lying woodland areas is expected between US
221 and Goldmine Rd at these levels, as well as the Edwin
Griffin Nature Preserve and The Country Club of Spartanburg.
- Another round of heavy rainfall is impacting metro
Spartanburg as of 10pm, producing another half inch of rain
over a short period of time.  This is likely to trigger areas
of additional nuisance flooding and will exacerbate ongoing
stream rises, prolonging high flows into the early overnight
hours.  Additional pockets of heavy rainfall are possible for
at least through midnight, and this may further prolong
ongoing flooding and cause new localized flooding to develop.
Stay weather aware tonight if traveling on area roadways and
turn around when encountering flooded roadways.
- Some locations that may experience nuisance flooding
include...
Spartanburg, Laurens, Greer, Woodruff, Duncan, Lyman,
Pacolet, Cowpens, Wellford, Roebuck, Gray Court, Pacolet
Mills, Reidville, Moore, Croft State Park, Cedar Springs,
Enoree, and Ora.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.</instruction>
