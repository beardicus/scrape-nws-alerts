<headline>Flood Watch issued September 26 at 4:41PM EDT until September 29 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Miami</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of South Florida, including the following areas,
Coastal Broward, Coastal Collier, Coastal Miami-Dade, Coastal Palm
Beach, Far South Miami-Dade, Glades, Hendry, Inland Broward,
Inland Collier, Inland Miami-Dade, Inland Palm Beach, Mainland
Monroe, Metro Broward, Metro Miami-Dade and Metro Palm Beach.
* WHEN...Through Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Hurricane Ian is forecast by NHC to move northward through
the
Southeastern Gulf Of Mexico through Wednesday. This will
allow for
the PWAT values to increase from 2.2 inches this afternoon to
2.3 to
2.5 inches on Tuesday and remain in the 2.2 to 2.4 inch range
on
Wednesday. These PWAT values are near the maximum values for
this
time of year. This means that South Florida will see the
potential for heavy rainfall this afternoon through at least
Wednesday night.
Forecast rainfall amounts will generally range from 4 to 6
inches
across the region from Hurricane Ian. There could be isolated
amounts of up 10 inches where repeated rounds of heavy
rainfall
occur. These rainfall amounts will be capable of producing
flooding
conditions due to the grounds being already saturated from
the daily
heavy rainfall that has been occurring over South Florida the
last
several days. WPC has also put the metro areas of South
Florida in a
Moderate Risk of Flooding with the interior areas of South
Florida
in a Slight Risk of Flooding for Tuesday. Most areas will
remain in
a slight risk of excessive rainfall on Wednesday. The
exception to
this will be over southern areas, where a marginal risk will
remain
in place. Therefore, a Flood Watch has been issued for all of
South
Florida through Thursday morning.

Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
