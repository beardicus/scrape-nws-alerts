above ground somewhere within surge prone areas
- Window of concern: Wednesday morning until Friday morning
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm
surge flooding greater than 3 feet above ground
- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of
greater than 3 feet above ground.
- PREPARE: Storm surge flooding preparations should be
underway. Assemble disaster supplies and know your
evacuation route.
- ACT: Leave if evacuation orders are given for your area.
Failure to heed evacuation orders may result in the loss of
your life.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant
- This statement pertains to storm surge forecasts up to 6
feet Above Ground Level (AGL) for portions of Glynn County
east of Interstate 95.
- All major causeways will be flooded at the time of high
tide with debris likely piled up on and near the roadways.
Saint Simons, Jekyll, and Sea Islands will all be
completely cut off during the high tide cycle. The Village
and Casino areas of Saint Simons Island may experience
storm surge flooding to a depth of 6 feet on the
lower-elevation streets such as East Peachtree Street. Some
homes along and near Dunbar Creek, including Ledbetter
Island, will flood with storm surge.
- The Oglethorpe Point Elementary School area could
experience flooding of up to 3 feet. Ground level portions
of Golden Island Marina and Frederica Yacht Club will be
totally inundated. Lower streets and neighborhoods on
Jekyll Island may flood to a depth of 4 feet. Lower
portions of Colonel&amp;#039;s Island may flood up to 6 feet.
- In the City of Brunswick, many neighborhoods in the lower
portions of the city south of L Street and also those
locations east of the Altama Connector will flood. Some of
the lowest areas may flood to a depth up to 6 feet. Howard
Coffin Park, River Road and Mansfield Road, near Old City
Hall may flood to 6 feet. Flooding near the City of
Brunswick Fire Station and Goodyear Elementary School may
be 2 to 4 feet. Portions of the Blythe Island Highway, or
Old Jacksonville Highway, will flood to a depth of 3 feet.
Flooding will occur along the banks of the Altama Canal.
- Wildlife including reptiles and rodents are semi-aquatic
and will be looking for high ground to escape storm surge
and rainfall flooding. Snakes, raccoons and some insects
including fire ants will seek higher elevations, and this
may include homes surrounded by water.
- This is a summary of storm surge impacts. Every
neighborhood that will experience flooding is not
mentioned. Do not return until Glynn County Emergency
Management advises it is safe to do so.
* FLOODING RAIN

amounts
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST

moderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues
are possible.
- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area
vulnerable to flooding.
- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take
action may result in serious injury or loss of life.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations
and rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with
swifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,
especially in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams,
creeks, canals, and ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken
foundations. Several places may experience expanded areas
of rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and
poor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on
moving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.
Driving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge
closures.
