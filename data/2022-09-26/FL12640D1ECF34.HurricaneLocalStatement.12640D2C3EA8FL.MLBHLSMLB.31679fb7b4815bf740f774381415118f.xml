**TROPICAL STORM WATCHES IN EFFECT FOR INLAND COUNTIES OF EAST CENTRAL FLORIDA**
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Watch has been issued for Northern Lake,
Okeechobee, Orange, Osceola, Seminole, and Southern Lake
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Northern Lake,
Okeechobee, Orange, Osceola, Seminole, and Southern Lake
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 670 miles south of Leesburg FL or about 650 miles south
of Orlando FL
- 19.1N 82.7W
- Storm Intensity 80 mph
- Movement Northwest or 325 degrees at 13 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Ian located 100 miles west of Grand Cayman with
80 mph winds continues to strengthen while moving Northwest at 13
mph. Ian is forecast to cross the westernmost portion of Cuba as a
major hurricane early Tuesday and enter the southeast Gulf of Mexico
Tuesday afternoon.
With the forecast arrival of the outer winds of Ian in central Florida
on Wednesday, a Tropical Storm Watch is now in effect for all inland
counties of east central Florida.
Occasional squalls, containing wind gusts to tropical storm force will
spread north over the region beginning early Wednesday. Periods of
very heavy rainfall, gusty winds will occur, especially within rain
band squalls. A Flood Watch will likely be in effect by tonight. There
will also be a concern for the development of tornadoes beginning
Wednesday, persisting through at least Thursday as Ian pulls
slowly northward near the west coast of Florida.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across east central Florida. Potential impacts
include:
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may
become dangerous rivers. In mountain areas, destructive runoff
may run quickly down valleys while increasing susceptibility to
rockslides and mudslides. Flood control systems and barriers
may become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.
Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with
underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.
Many road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
* WIND:
Prepare for life-threatening wind having possible extensive impacts
across inland areas of east central Florida. Potential impacts in this area
include:
- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some having
window, door, and garage door failures leading to structural
damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed.
Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Locations may be
uninhabitable for weeks.
- Many large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and
roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. Several bridges, causeways, and
access routes impassable.
- Large areas with power and communications outages.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
east central Florida. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
* SURGE:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time across East Central
Florida.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
For those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,
falling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move,
relocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help keep
roadways open for those under evacuation orders.
If evacuating, leave with a destination in mind and allow extra time
to get there. Take your emergency supplies kit. Gas up your vehicle
ahead of time.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
If you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as
near the ocean or a large inland lake, in a low-lying or poor
drainage area, in a valley, or near an already swollen river, plan to
move to safe shelter on higher ground.
When securing your property, outside preparations should be concluded
as soon as possible before conditions deteriorate. The onset of
strong gusty winds or flooding can cause certain preparedness
activities to become unsafe.
Check on those who may not be fully aware of the situation or who are
unable to make personal preparations.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes
to the forecast.
There is a threat from tornadoes with this storm. Have multiple ways
to receive Tornado Warnings. Be ready to shelter quickly.
