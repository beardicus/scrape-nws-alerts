SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Ian is forecast to continue to strengthen into a major
hurricane as it approaches western Cuba and enter the Gulf of Mexico
on Tuesday. While a direct landfall to South Florida is unlikely at
this time, hazardous conditions will extend well away from the center
of the system, and these are the possible impacts for South Florida:
* Multiple rounds of heavy rainfall associated with rainbands may lead
to flooding across all of South Florida. Rainfall totals may range
3 to 8 inches through Thursday with locally higher amounts possible,
and the risk could extend later into the week. This may result in
significant flooding impacts.
* Peak storm surge values of 3 to 5 feet are possible along the
Southwest Florida coast mainly between Tuesday night and Wednesday
night. This could lead to significant and life-threatening storm surge
flooding.
* Tornadoes may be embedded in showers and thunderstorms within the
outer rainbands associated with the system. Main concern is from
tonight through Wednesday.
* Hazardous marine and beach conditions are expected with a high risk
for rip currents across all South Florida beaches. Elevated surf
conditions are expected along the Gulf coast.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
Prepare for dangerous wind having possible significant impacts primarily
across portions of Southwest Florida from Mainland Monroe county to Glades
county.
. Potential impacts in this area include:
- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage
to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings
experiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile
homes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight
objects become dangerous projectiles.
- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater
numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several
fences and roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access
routes impassable.
- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent
in areas with above ground lines.
Also, prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts
across the rest of South Florida.
* SURGE:
Prepare for life-threatening surge having possible significant
impacts across the Southwest Florida coast. Potential impacts in this
area include:
- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by
waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become
weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low
spots.
- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and
numerous rip currents.
- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.
Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in
unprotected anchorages.
Also, prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across the coast of Florida Bay. Minor tidal flooding is also
possible in vulnerable locations along the southeastern coast of South
Florida.
* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant
impacts across South Florida. Potential impacts include:
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and
rescues.
- Ditches and canals may quickly become swollen with swift
currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially
in usually vulnerable spots.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.
Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid
inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as
storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions
become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.
* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across
South Florida. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, mobile
homes pushed off foundations or overturned, large tree tops and
branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving
vehicles blown off roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the
center of the storm.
