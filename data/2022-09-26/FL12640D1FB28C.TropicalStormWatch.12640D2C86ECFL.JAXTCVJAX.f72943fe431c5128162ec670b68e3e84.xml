<description>...STORM SURGE WATCH IN EFFECT...
...TROPICAL STORM WATCH IN EFFECT...
A Storm Surge Watch means life-threatening inundation, from rising
water moving inland from the coastline, is possible somewhere within
this area within the next 48 hours
A Tropical Storm Watch means tropical storm-force winds are possible
somewhere within this area within the next 48 hours
* LOCATIONS AFFECTED
- Arlington
- Jacksonville
- Jacksonville Beach
- Oceanway
- Tallyrand
* WIND
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Equivalent Tropical Storm force wind
- Peak Wind Forecast: 40-50 mph with gusts to 85 mph

until Friday evening
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for wind 39
to 57 mph
- PLAN: Plan for hazardous wind of equivalent tropical storm
force.
- PREPARE: Efforts to protect property should now be
underway. Prepare for limited wind damage.
- ACT: Act now to complete preparations before the wind
becomes hazardous.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees
are shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown
over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within
urban or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving
conditions on bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* STORM SURGE
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible
- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 2-4 feet
above ground somewhere within surge prone areas
- Window of concern: Wednesday morning until Friday morning
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm
surge flooding greater than 3 feet above ground
- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of
greater than 3 feet above ground.
- PREPARE: Storm surge flooding preparations should be
underway. Assemble disaster supplies and know your
evacuation route.
- ACT: Leave if evacuation orders are given for your area.
Failure to heed evacuation orders may result in the loss of
your life.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant
- This statement pertains to storm surge inundation up to 6
feet above normally dry ground for areas east of Interstate
95 in Duval County.
- Oceanfront surge flooding will reach the dune line, with
wave run up and over wash possible at the vehicle crossover
points at Atlantic Boulevard, 8th Avenue North, Beach
Boulevard and 16th Avenue South.
- Most storm surge flooding that impacts the Jacksonville
Beaches will inundate from the Intracoastal Waterway, with
flooding along Sherman Creek into Atlantic Beach, Hopkins
Creek to the Aquatic Drive area, and in drainage canals
paralleling Seminole Road and 3rd Street. Storm surge
flooding combined with heavy rainfall will likely flood
these locations. Locations along Aquatic Drive, Skate Road,
Cavalla Road, Sargo Road, the Atlantic Beach Police
Station, Atlantic Beach City Hall, and several blocks on
either side of 3rd Street, from Jarboe Park south to
Huguenot Park, will experience major storm surge flooding.
Kings Road Bridge will be impassable around times of high
tide.
- Low-lying neighborhoods near the immediate Intracoastal
Waterway will likely have major storm surge flooding. This
includes The Sanctuary area where storm surge flood water
will inundate streets and flood into numerous homes.
- Storm surge inundation will flood locations along Beach
Boulevard near the Palm Cove Marina. Streets in the Isle of
Palms will flood with storm surge and some single story
homes will be inundated with surge flooding. Storm surge
inundation will also enter some homes in Queens Harbor and
along Greenfield and Mount Pleasant Creeks. Storm surge
inundation will cover portions of the Wonderwood Expressway
at Mount Pleasant Creek. Heckscher Drive will be inundated
by storm surge flood water in areas including near Fire
Station 40.
- Storm surge flooding will occur on Blount Island and impact
the Tallyrand Docks. Some homes in Chaseville near Reddie
Point Preserve will flood. Waterfront areas of the
Jacksonville Zoo will experience storm surge inundation.
Flooding will occur along the banks of the Arlington River,
with storm surge inundation into some homes in the Oak
Haven area. Storm surge flooding will occur in Southampton
with inundation up to 8 feet in depth near the Chamber of
Commerce Building. Storm surge water will cover portions of
the TIAA Bank Field. Portions of Eagle Bend and Black
Hammock Island will experience storm surge inundation,
including into some low-lying homes.
- The combination of storm surge flooding and rainfall
flooding will lead to more extensive total water flooding
in some areas, including the Jacksonville Beaches.
- Wildlife including reptiles and rodents are semi-aquatic
and will be looking for high ground to escape storm surge
and rainfall flooding. Snakes, raccoons and some insects
including fire ants will seek higher elevations, and this
may include homes surrounded by flood water.
- This is a summary of surge impacts. Every neighborhood that
will experience flooding is not mentioned. Please heed the
advice of local Emergency Management.
* FLOODING RAIN
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:
- Peak Rainfall Amounts: 8-12 inches, with locally higher
amounts
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for major
flooding rain
- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for
major flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues are
likely.
- PREPARE: Strongly consider protective actions, especially
if you are in an area vulnerable to flooding.
- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take
action will likely result in serious injury or loss of life.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches
may become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and
barriers may become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or
washed away. Many places where flood waters may cover
escape routes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of
moving water with underpasses submerged. Driving conditions
become dangerous. Many road and bridge closures with some
weakened or washed out.
* TORNADO
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:
- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for a few
tornadoes
- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a
few tornadoes.
- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to
tornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before
hazardous weather arrives.
- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter
quickly.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the
execution of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with
power and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings,
chimneys toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or
overturned, large tree tops and branches snapped off,
shallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving vehicles blown
off roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.
