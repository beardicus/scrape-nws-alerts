<headline>Flood Warning issued September 26 at 10:25AM AKDT  by NWS Juneau</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM AKDT TUESDAY...
...REPLACES FLOOD ADVISORY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...The Taiya River near Skagway.
* WHEN...Until 700 PM AKDT Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, other low-lying
areas and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1020 AM AKDT, River gauge reports indicate rises in water
levels from heavy rain across the warned area. Flooding is
ongoing or expected to begin shortly, especially near The
Taiya River. Additional rainfall amounts of around 2 inches
are possible.
- Areas along low lying portions of the Chilkoot Trail is the
most likely place to experience flooding.
- For Taiya River near Skagway:
At 10:00am Monday the stage was 17.08 feet.
Flood Stage is 16.5 feet.
Forecast: A crest between 17.2 and 17.5 feet is expected
Monday evening.
Impacts:
At 17.0 feet: The National Park Service advises against
boating and other recreational water-based activities on the
Taiya River. Trail orientation and navigation begins to
become difficult and may hinder route-finding for several
hundred feet. Water will be knee deep or higher in places
along the lower portions of the trail.
At 17.5 feet: The National Park Service may close the
Chilkoot Trail due to flooding impacts associated with high
water in the surrounding watershed.</description>
<instruction>Stay tuned to further developments by listening to your local radio,
television, or NOAA Weather Radio for further information.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
