<headline>Special Weather Statement issued September 26 at 3:04AM CDT  by NWS Huntsville</headline>
<description>...Patchy Dense Fog was impacting portions of the Tennessee
Valley...
Patchy Dense Fog continued across portions of Franklin County
Tennessee, as well as Jackson, DeKalb, and Marshall Counties in
Alabama, with visibilities reduced to one quarter of a mile or less
in isolated areas. Some locations that were being impacted by fog
include areas near Winchester, the Paint Rock Valley in Jackson
County, portions of U.S. Highway 72 in northeast Jackson County, and
the DeKalb Valley.
Motorists are urged to drive with extreme caution, as visibilities
will vary significantly given the patchy nature of the fog. Use low
beams, reduce driving speed, and allow for plenty of room between
you and other vehicles.
Stay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio, or a favorite local media outlet,
for further statements or updates from the National Weather Service
in Huntsville.</description>
