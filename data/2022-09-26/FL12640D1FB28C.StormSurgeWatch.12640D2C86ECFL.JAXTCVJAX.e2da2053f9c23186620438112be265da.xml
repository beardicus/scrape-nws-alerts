<description>...STORM SURGE WATCH IN EFFECT...
...TROPICAL STORM WATCH IN EFFECT...
A Storm Surge Watch means life-threatening inundation, from rising
water moving inland from the coastline, is possible somewhere within
this area within the next 48 hours
A Tropical Storm Watch means tropical storm-force winds are possible
somewhere within this area within the next 48 hours
* LOCATIONS AFFECTED
- Amelia City
- Fernandina Beach
- Yulee
* WIND
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Equivalent Tropical Storm force wind
- Peak Wind Forecast: 40-50 mph with gusts to 85 mph
- Window for Tropical Storm force winds: early Thursday
morning until early Saturday morning
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for wind 39
to 57 mph
- PLAN: Plan for hazardous wind of equivalent tropical storm
force.
- PREPARE: Efforts to protect property should now be
underway. Prepare for limited wind damage.
- ACT: Act now to complete preparations before the wind
becomes hazardous.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees
are shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown
over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within
urban or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving
conditions on bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* STORM SURGE
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible
- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 2-4 feet
above ground somewhere within surge prone areas
- Window of concern: Wednesday morning until Friday morning
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm
surge flooding greater than 3 feet above ground
- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of
greater than 3 feet above ground.
- PREPARE: Storm surge flooding preparations should be
underway. Assemble disaster supplies and know your
evacuation route.
- ACT: Leave if evacuation orders are given for your area.
Failure to heed evacuation orders may result in the loss of
your life.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant
- This statement pertains to storm surge inundation up to 6
feet above normally dry ground for areas east of Interstate
95 in Nassau County.
- Oceanfront surge will likely breach the dune line in the
Ocean Avenue and North Fletcher Avenue areas north of the
Main Beach with storm surge flooding across streets.
- Major flooding of the Egans Creek Greenway is expected.
Flooding on streets near the Jean LaFitte Boulevard will
occur with water entering garages and some lower
lying-homes. Storm surge inundation along North Front
Street inland to North 3rd Street, including near Tiger
Point Marina. Flooding of roads and homes is expected from
Beachwood Road south to the Nassau Sound Bridge. Storm
surge will spread over A-1A south of the roundabouts.
- The Nassau Sound Bridge will be inaccessible during the
peak flooding around times of high tide. The bridge may be
prone to scour and may not reopen until inspected.
- While water is not expected across the Shave Bridge
Causeway, spray and wave run up may make the bridge
impassable around times of high tide. Most of Piney Island
and Oyster Bay Harbor will flood with water into ground
level homes. U.S. Highway 17 will flood in areas south of
Hedges toward the Nassau River, with high wave action
across the roadway around times of high tide.
- Wildlife including reptiles and rodents are semi-aquatic
and will be looking for high ground to escape storm surge
and rainfall flooding. Snakes, raccoons and some insects
including fire ants will seek higher elevations, and this
may include homes surrounded by flood water.
- This is a summary of surge impacts. Every neighborhood that
will experience flooding is not mentioned. Please heed the
advice of local Emergency Management.
* FLOODING RAIN
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:
- Peak Rainfall Amounts: 8-12 inches, with locally higher
amounts
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for
moderate flooding rain
- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for
moderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues
are possible.
- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area
vulnerable to flooding.
- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take
action may result in serious injury or loss of life.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations
and rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with
swifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,
especially in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams,
creeks, canals, and ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken
foundations. Several places may experience expanded areas
of rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and
poor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on
moving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.
Driving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge
closures.
* TORNADO
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:
- Situation is unfavorable for tornadoes
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Tornadoes not expected
