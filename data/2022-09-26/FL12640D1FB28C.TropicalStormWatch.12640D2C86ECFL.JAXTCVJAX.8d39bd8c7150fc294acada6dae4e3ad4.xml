mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees
are shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown
over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within
urban or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving
conditions on bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
* STORM SURGE
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible
- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 2-4 feet
above ground somewhere within surge prone areas
- Window of concern: Wednesday morning until Friday morning

UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm
surge flooding greater than 3 feet above ground
- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of
greater than 3 feet above ground.
- PREPARE: Storm surge flooding preparations should be
underway. Assemble disaster supplies and know your
evacuation route.
- ACT: Leave if evacuation orders are given for your area.
Failure to heed evacuation orders may result in the loss of
your life.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant
- This statement pertains to storm surge forecasts up to 6
feet Above Ground Level (AGL) for portions of Duval County
along the Trout River west of Interstate 95. Many ground
level homes will flood along rivers and creeks.
- Life-threatening flooding is expected in the Island Pointe
Apartments with 4 to 6 feet of flood water inundation.
Island Pointe Drive will be cut off and isolated. Flooding
over Riverview as far inland as Delaware Ave can be
expected. Low-lying areas along the immediate banks of the
Ribault River and Moncrief Creek will flood to 6 feet with
additional rainfall flooding adding to water levels. Homes
along Broward Road will flood up to 5 feet. Broward Drive
will be impassable in many locations. Trout River Blvd will
be cut off in several low spots where creeks cross it,
especially near Indian Road.
- This is a summary of storm surge impacts. Every
neighborhood that will experience flooding is not
mentioned. Heed the guidance of local Emergency Management.

amounts
- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST

vulnerable to flooding.
- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take
action may result in serious injury or loss of life.
- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant
- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations
and rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with
swifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,
especially in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams,
creeks, canals, and ditches overflow.
- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken
foundations. Several places may experience expanded areas
of rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and
poor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on
moving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.
Driving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge
closures.
