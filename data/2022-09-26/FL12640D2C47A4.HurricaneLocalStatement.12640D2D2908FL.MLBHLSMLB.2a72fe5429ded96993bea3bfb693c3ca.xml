SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Ian was located about 525 miles south of Leesburg at 11 pm,
with 105 mph winds, and continues to strengthen while moving north
northwest at 13 mph. Ian is forecast to cross the westernmost
portion of Cuba as a major hurricane early Tuesday and enter the
southeast Gulf of Mexico while continuing strengthening through
Tuesday afternoon. Ian is then forecast to track north northeast
offshore of the southwest Florida coast on Wednesday, and approach the
west central Florida coast Wednesday night and Thursday, while slowing
in forward speed.
As Ian approaches the west central Florida coast, tropical storm
conditions will develop across east central Florida from north to south
on Wednesday into Wednesday night. A Hurricane Watch is now in effect
for Lake County, and a Tropical Storm Warning is now in effect for all
inland east central Florida counties. A Tropical Storm Watch remains in
effect for all coastal east central Florida counties. Flooding impacts
may begin as early as Tuesday, and wind impacts as early as Wednesday.
Significant to extensive wind impacts are expected, with the onset of
tropical storm wind gusts from the outer bands of Ian Wednesday, and
deteoriating wind conditions expected Wednesday night into Thursday.
Wind impacts may linger into Thursday night and early Friday across
mainly northern portions of east central Florida from Orlando and Cape
Canaveral northward depending if the system slows further from its
current forecast path.
Locally heavy rainfall amounts are expected Tuesday through Thursday
night across east central Florida. Storm total rainfall amounts may
reach 5 to 10 inches with some localized spots reaching 12 inches. A
Flood Watch is in effect across all of east central Florida through
late Thursday night. Additional areal and river is likely across
portions of east central Florida that receive the heaviest rainfall.
The environment will be increasingly favorable for the development
of isolated tornadoes across east central Florida Tuesday through
mid week.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
extensive impacts across east central Florida. Potential
impacts include:
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may
become dangerous rivers. In mountain areas, destructive runoff
may run quickly down valleys while increasing susceptibility to
rockslides and mudslides. Flood control systems and barriers
may become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.
Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with
underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.
Many road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.
* WIND:
Protect against life-threatening wind having possible extensive
impacts across east central Florida. Potential impacts in
this area include:
- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some having
window, door, and garage door failures leading to structural
damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed.
Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Locations may be
uninhabitable for weeks.
- Many large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and
roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. Several bridges, causeways, and
access routes impassable.
- Large areas with power and communications outages.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts
across East Central Florida. Potential impacts include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
* SURGE:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time across East Central
Florida.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Listen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
including possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so
immediately.
For those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,
falling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move,
relocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help keep
roadways open for those under evacuation orders.
If evacuating, leave with a destination in mind and allow extra time
to get there. Take your emergency supplies kit. Gas up your vehicle
ahead of time.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
It is important to remain calm, informed, and focused during an
emergency. Be patient and helpful with those you encounter.
If you are a visitor, be sure to know the name of the city or town in
which you are staying and the name of the county in which it resides.
Listen for these locations in local news updates. Pay attention for
instructions from local authorities.
Rapidly rising flood waters are dangerous. If you are in a flood-prone
area, consider moving to higher ground. Never drive through a flooded
roadway. Remember, turn around don`t drown!
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
