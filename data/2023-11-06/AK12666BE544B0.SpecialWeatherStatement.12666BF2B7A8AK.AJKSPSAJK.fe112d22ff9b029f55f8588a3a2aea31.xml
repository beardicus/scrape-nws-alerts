<description>...A STORM FORCE LOW FOR MID WEEK...
A strong low over the Gulf of Alaska looks to bring a storm force
front to the panhandle for the middle of the week. This system
will bring increased winds along the outer coast as well as areas
along the Dixon Entrance. Wind gusts could range from 40 to 60
mph. While details on the exact wind speeds are still not
solidified based to the latest forecast solutions, the forecast
guidance continues to show a significant front impacting the area
Wednesday morning to Thursday morning. As such, confidence in this
system continues to increase as well. Most places look to see
their strongest winds during the day and into the evening on
Wednesday. The exception to this being the southern panhandle,
specifically Prince of Wales Island, which could see high winds
through Thursday morning before wind speeds decrease across the
area.
This is an evolving and changing situation. Stay tuned to the
National Weather Service for updates at weather.gov/Juneau.</description>
