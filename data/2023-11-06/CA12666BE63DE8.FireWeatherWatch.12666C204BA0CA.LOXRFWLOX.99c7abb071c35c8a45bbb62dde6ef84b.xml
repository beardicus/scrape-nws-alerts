<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued November 06 at 1:54PM PST until November 09 at 6:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM NOON WEDNESDAY UNTIL 6 PM
THURSDAY FOR MOST MOUNTAIN AND VALLEY AREAS OF LA/VENTURA COUNTIES
AS WELL AS THE MALIBU COAST DUE TO GUSTY SANTA ANA WINDS AND LOW
HUMIDITY...
.Another round of gusty Santa Ana winds and low humidities will
impact portions of Los Angeles and Ventura counties Wednesday
into Thursday. The gusty offshore winds will begin late Tuesday
night or Wednesday morning, but the humidity levels will most
likely not fall to critical levels until Wednesday afternoon or
evening. While there is still some uncertainty in the strength
of this upcoming Santa Ana wind event, there is at least a 50
percent chance of reaching Red Flag Warning durations from
Wednesday afternoon into Thursday afternoon for the most wind
prone areas of LA and Ventura counties. Elevated fire weather
conditions are likely across wind prone areas of San Luis
Obispo and Santa Barbara counties.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
THURSDAY AFTERNOON FOR GUSTY SANTA ANA WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE
HUMIDITY FOR WIND PRONE VALLEYS OF LOS ANGELES AND VENTURA
COUNTIES AS WELL AS THE MALIBU COAST...

40 mph.
