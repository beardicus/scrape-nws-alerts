<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued November 06 at 1:36PM PST until November 07 at 3:00AM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 3 PM THIS
AFTERNOON TO 3 AM PST TUESDAY ABOVE 8000 FEET...
* WHAT...Rain and snow showers will be heavy at times through
early Tuesday morning. Total snow accumulations of 2 to 5
inches at 8000 feet with 4 to 8 inches possible around Sierra
passes including Sonora and Tioga. Winds gusting as high as 45
mph, with wind prone areas along Highway 395 gusting to 60, and
Sierra summits 80 to 100 mph.
* WHERE...Mono County.
* WHEN...From 3 PM this afternoon to 3 AM PST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions through the evening
commute. Wet roads can be just as dangerous as snow covered
roads. Gusty winds could cause tree damage.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Bursts of heavy snow with very low
visibility may lead to dangerous travel conditions through this
evening.</description>
<instruction>Even light snowfall causes major travel delays, especially during
periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to
reach your destination. Leave extra space between vehicles since
it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
