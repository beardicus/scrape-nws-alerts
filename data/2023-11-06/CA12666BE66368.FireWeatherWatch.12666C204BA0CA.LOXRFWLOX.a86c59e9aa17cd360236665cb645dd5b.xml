<description>CORRECTED TO ADD CALABASAS AND AGOURA HILLS ZONES
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM NOON WEDNESDAY UNTIL 6 PM
THURSDAY FOR MOST MOUNTAIN AND VALLEY AREAS OF LA/VENTURA
COUNTIES AS WELL AS THE MALIBU COAST DUE TO GUSTY SANTA ANA WINDS
AND LOW HUMIDITY...
.Another round of gusty Santa Ana winds and low humidities will
impact portions of Los Angeles and Ventura counties Wednesday
into Thursday. The gusty offshore winds will begin late Tuesday
night or Wednesday morning, but the humidity levels will most
likely not fall to critical levels until Wednesday afternoon or
evening. While there is still some uncertainty in the strength of
this upcoming Santa Ana wind event, there is at least a
50 percent chance of reaching Red Flag Warning durations from
Wednesday afternoon into Thursday afternoon for the most wind
prone areas of LA and Ventura counties. Elevated fire weather
conditions are likely across wind prone areas of San Luis Obispo
and Santa Barbara counties.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON FOR GUSTY SANTA ANA WINDS AND LOW
RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR CALABASAS AND AGOURA HILLS...
The National Weather Service in Los Angeles/Oxnard has issued a
Fire Weather Watch for wind and low relative humidity, which is
in effect from Wednesday afternoon through Thursday afternoon.
* WINDS...North to northeast winds 15 to 30 mph with gusts 30 to
40 mph.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...Falling to 10 to 20 percent by Wednesday
afternoon and evening, and 8 to 15 percent by Thursday.
* Impacts...If fire ignition occurs there could be rapid spread
of wildfire that would lead to a threat to life and property.</description>
<instruction>A Fire Weather Watch means that critical fire weather conditions
are likely to occur in the coming days. Residents near wildland
interfaces should prepare now on what to do if a wildfire breaks
out. See readyforwildfire.org and wildfirerisk.org for
