<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued November 06 at 1:54PM PST until November 09 at 6:00PM PST by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM NOON WEDNESDAY UNTIL 6 PM
THURSDAY FOR MOST MOUNTAIN AND VALLEY AREAS OF LA/VENTURA COUNTIES
AS WELL AS THE MALIBU COAST DUE TO GUSTY SANTA ANA WINDS AND LOW
HUMIDITY...
.Another round of gusty Santa Ana winds and low humidities will
impact portions of Los Angeles and Ventura counties Wednesday
into Thursday. The gusty offshore winds will begin late Tuesday
night or Wednesday morning, but the humidity levels will most
likely not fall to critical levels until Wednesday afternoon or
evening. While there is still some uncertainty in the strength
of this upcoming Santa Ana wind event, there is at least a 50
percent chance of reaching Red Flag Warning durations from
Wednesday afternoon into Thursday afternoon for the most wind
prone areas of LA and Ventura counties. Elevated fire weather
conditions are likely across wind prone areas of San Luis
Obispo and Santa Barbara counties.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
THURSDAY AFTERNOON FOR GUSTY SANTA ANA WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE
HUMIDITY FOR THE MOUNTAINS OF LOS ANGELES AND VENTURA COUNTIES...
The National Weather Service in Los Angeles/Oxnard has issued a
Fire Weather Watch FOR GUSTY SANTA ANA WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE
HUMIDITY, which is in effect from Wednesday afternoon through
Thursday afternoon.
* Winds...North to northeast 25 to 35 mph with gusts 40 to 50 mph.
Strongest winds across the mountains and foothills of eastern
Ventura and western Los Angeles counties.
* Relative Humidity...Falling to 10 to 20 percent by Wednesday
afternoon and evening, and 8 to 15 percent on Thursday. Poor
humidity recovery between 12 and 25 percent expected Wednesday
night across wind prone mountains and foothills.
* Impacts...If fire ignition occurs there could be rapid spread
of wildfire that would lead to a threat to life and property.</description>
