<description>...ENHANCED FIRE DANGER IN WEST VIRGINIA TODAY...
Relative Humidity values will lower to between 28 to 35 percent
through early this afternoon, before gradually recovering through
early this evening. Light southwest winds will increase 7 to 12
mph, with gusts of around 20 mph this afternoon. This combination
of gusty winds and lower relative humidity will bring an increased
threat of wildfire activity today.
Fall fire season for the state of West Virginia runs from October
1st through December 31st. From October 1st through December
31st, West Virginia law prohibits all outdoor burning between the
hours of 7am and 5pm. Fall is a dangerous time for forest fires in
West Virginia as warm weather, and sometimes dry and windy
conditions, often combines with dry leaves and dead grasses on the
ground to create an enhanced fire danger.
All burning between the hours of 7am and 5pm, or during extremely
dry or windy conditions, should be avoided. When burning debris,
supervise all fires until they are completely extinguished. Keep a
rake, shovel, and a water source such as a hose nearby in case
the fire does escape. Also, create a 10 foot perimeter around the
fire so that it does not spread away from you. In addition,
caution should be exercised to prevent fires from inadvertently
starting, such as by avoiding smoking outdoors in fire prone
areas, taking extra care to prevent sparks from equipment or
machinery from triggering fire starts, and educating children
about the dangers of playing with fire.
For more information on West Virginia fire laws, contact the West
Virginia Division of Forestry or your local fire department.
If a fire does get out of control, call 911 immediately.</description>
