SPOTS DURING HIGH TIDE LATE EACH EVENING THIS WEEK...

in the localized flooding of specific low lying areas each year.
In addition, the lowest low tides of the event will be observed
during the early morning hours which may lead to trouble for
mariners navigating shallow waterways. The King Tides tidal
readings are expected to peak Wednesday night.
