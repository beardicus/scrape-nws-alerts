<headline>Rip Current Statement issued July 11 at 4:40PM EDT until July 12 at 9:00PM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH
TUESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents
expected. For the Coastal Flood Statement, less than a foot of
inundation above ground level expected in vulnerable areas
near the waterfront and shoreline.
* WHERE...Southern Queens and Southern Nassau Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, from Tuesday morning
through Tuesday evening. For the Coastal Flood Statement,
until 9 PM EDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Brief minor flooding of the more vulnerable
locations near the waterfront and shoreline. Life-threatening
rip currents are likely for all people entering the surf zone.
Anyone visiting the beaches should stay out of the surf. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Similar water levels are likely with the
evening high tide cycles through Thursday.</description>
<instruction>Do not drive through flooded roadways.
If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
