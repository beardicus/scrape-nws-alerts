<description>...A SNOW SQUALL WILL AFFECT PARTS OF SOMERSET COUNTY...
HAZARDS...A snow squall accompanied by winds of up to 30 MPH which
can rapidly reduce visibility to less than a quarter of a mile.
LOCATION AND MOVEMENT...At 707 PM EDT, a snow squall was 13 miles
east of Connellsville moving southeast at 40 MPH.
LOCATIONS IMPACTED INCLUDE...
Somerset, Meyersdale, Berlin, Friedens, New Centerville, Rockwood,
Garrett, Indian Lake, Shanksville, Seven Springs and Flight 93
National Memorial.
* This includes The Pennsylvania Turnpike from mile markers 100 to
123.
SAFETY INFO...
Use extra caution if you must travel into or through this squall.
Rapid changes in visibility and potentially slick roads may lead to
accidents.
A drop in temperature may cause black ice to form on roadways.
Black ice is nearly impossible to see and roadways may appear only
wet. Please use extreme caution, especially on bridges, overpasses
and around curves. Allow plenty of stopping distance and avoid
braking suddenly.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time to reach your destination.
