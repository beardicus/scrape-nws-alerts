<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued April 19 at 9:08PM PDT until April 23 at 3:00AM PDT by NWS Monterey</headline>
<description>.A long period swell of 18 to 20 seconds arrives early Thursday
morning with swell heights over 12 feet from coastal Sonoma
County to coastal Monterey County. The swell arrives over the
northern waters early Thursday morning, moving southward
impacting area beaches through Thursday evening into Friday
morning, resulting in a high risk of sneaker waves and strong rip
currents. Swell periods will diminish slightly to 15 to
17 seconds on Friday, but the risk for sneaker waves and rip
currents will persist. Additionally during this time period, the
high energy of this swell may result in larger breaking waves in
the surf zone from 14 to 18 feet. Swell heights and periods are
expected to diminish below risk threshold Friday overnight into
Saturday.
