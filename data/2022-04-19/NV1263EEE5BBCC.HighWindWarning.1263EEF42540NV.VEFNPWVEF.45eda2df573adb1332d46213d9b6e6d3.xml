* WHAT...Southwest winds 35 to 45 mph with gusts over 70 mph.
* WHERE...Spring Mountains-Red Rock Canyon.
* WHEN...Until 9 PM PDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Damaging winds will likely blow down trees and damage
power lines. Widespread power outages are expected. Travel will
be dangerous, especially for any high profile vehicles.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Wind gusts at Angel Peak have already
gusted early this morning above 70 mph. This potential will
continue through this afternoon. Wind gusts over 70 mph are

60 mph could be possible as low as Red Rock Canyon.</description>
<instruction>People should avoid being outside in forested areas and around
trees and branches. If possible, remain in the lower levels of
your home during the windstorm, and avoid windows. Use caution if
you must drive. Recreation is highly discouraged as these wind gusts
could be very dangerous to anyone outdoors.</instruction>
