        <headline>Air Quality Alert issued August 7 at 3:10PM PDT by NWS San Diego CA</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...The South Coast AQMD has issued an air quality alert due to
harmful levels of ozone pollution. Levels of ozone pollution can
vary by time and location depending on emissions and air pollution
transport.

* WHERE...The Inland Empire, San Gorgonio Pass near Banning,
Coachella Valley, and the Riverside and San Bernardino County
mountains.

* WHEN...until 8 PM Saturday. The highest ozone levels typically
occur in the afternoon and early-evening hours.

* IMPACTS... Ozone air pollution can cause serious health problems,
including trouble breathing, asthma attacks, and lung damage.
Everyone can be affected, but sensitive groups such as people with
lung disease, older adults, people who are pregnant, children, and
those who spend a lot of time outdoors are at greater risk.
</description>
        <instruction>To protect your health, check air quality levels and act as needed:

* When Air Quality Index (AQI) levels are "Unhealthy for Sensitive
Groups" (orange), sensitive groups as specified above should limit
extended or intense outdoor activity.

* When AQI is "Unhealthy" (red), everyone may experience health
impacts. Sensitive groups should avoid extended time outdoors.

* When AQI is "Very Unhealthy" (purple), sensitive groups should
avoid all outdoor physical activity. Everyone else should avoid
extended or intense outdoor activity.

* When AQI is "Hazardous" (maroon), everyone should avoid all
outdoor physical activity.
