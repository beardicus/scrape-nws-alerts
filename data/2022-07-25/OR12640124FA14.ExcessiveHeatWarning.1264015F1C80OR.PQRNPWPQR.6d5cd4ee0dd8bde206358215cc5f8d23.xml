<description>...EXCESSIVE HEAT WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM PDT
THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Dangerously hot conditions with temperatures up to 101
expected.
* WHERE...Central Willamette Valley.
* WHEN...From noon Monday to 9 PM PDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Extreme heat will significantly increase the potential
for heat related illnesses, particularly for those working or
participating in outdoor activities and for those that do not
have access to air conditioning.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The hottest temperatures are expected
Tuesday. Overnight lows in the mid to upper 60s in the Salem
Metro will provide little relief for those without air
conditioning. Overnight temperatures are expected
to lower below 70 degrees between 2 and 4 AM.</description>
<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
