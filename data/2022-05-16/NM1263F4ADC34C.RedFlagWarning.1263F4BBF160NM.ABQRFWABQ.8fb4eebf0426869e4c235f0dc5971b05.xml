<headline>Red Flag Warning issued May 16 at 3:07AM MDT until May 16 at 8:00PM MDT by NWS Albuquerque</headline>
<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FOR THE NORTHEAST HIGHLANDS FROM
NOON TO 8 PM MDT DUE TO THE THREAT OF DRY LIGHTNING AND SUDDEN
ERRATIC WIND SHIFTS FROM NEARBY THUNDERSTORMS...
.Near critical fire weather conditions will be exacerbated by the
development of scattered dry thunderstorms in the vicinity of the
ongoing Hermit`s Peak/Calf Canyon Fire. Dry lightning, and strong
to potentially severe sudden and erratic wind shifts will
accompany any passing or nearby storm cell. These storms are
expected to develop along the highlands and east slopes of the
central mountain chain, moving eastward toward TX during the
afternoon. The potential for sudden wind shifts from storm
outflows reaching the ongoing fire will exist into the early
evening before conditions begin calming by the late evening.
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO 8 PM MDT THIS
EVENING...
The National Weather Service in Albuquerque has issued a Red Flag
Warning...which is in effect from noon today to 8 PM MDT this
evening.
* AREA AND TIMING...Northeast Highlands.
* 20 FOOT WINDS...South to southwest 18 to 24 mph with gusts up to
35 mph, except 50 to 60 mph from storm outflows.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...Dropping to 15 to 20 percent.
* IMPACTS...Dry lightning with sudden and strong erratic wind
shifts from any nearby storm. Any new or ongoing fires will be
very hard to control. Outdoor burning should not be done.</description>
