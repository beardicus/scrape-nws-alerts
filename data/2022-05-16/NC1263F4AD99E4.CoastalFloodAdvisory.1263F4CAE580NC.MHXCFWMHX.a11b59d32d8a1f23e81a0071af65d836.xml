<description>...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EDT
TUESDAY...
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, 1 to 2 feet of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways. For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous
rip currents.
* WHERE...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, areas in North Topsail
Beach, the lower New River, and adjacent tidal creeks. For the
Beach Hazards Statement, along Onslow County beaches.
* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 8 PM EDT Tuesday.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of lots, parks, and roads with only
isolated road closures expected. Rip currents can sweep even
the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Strong king tide cycle in combination with
southerly winds will lead to increased water levels lasting into
early next week. Water levels will rise through the upcoming
high tide cycles, peaking Monday night and Tuesday night before
receding through the middle of the week. The most likely time
for strong rip currents to occur is a couple hours either side
of low tide, which will occur around 2 PM Monday.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
