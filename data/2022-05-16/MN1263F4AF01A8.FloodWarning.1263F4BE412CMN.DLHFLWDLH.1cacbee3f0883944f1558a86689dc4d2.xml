<headline>Flood Warning issued May 16 at 12:22PM CDT until further notice by NWS Duluth</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 1215 PM CDT WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of northeast Minnesota, including the following
county, St. Louis.
* WHEN...Until 1215 PM CDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying
and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring. Several
structures are flooded and some sand bagging operations are
continuing especially around Hunter and Bowman (Side) Lake.
Low-water crossings are inundated with water and may not be
passable. This includes Bear Island Road near Island Lake.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1211 PM CDT, Excessive runoff due to rainfall and snowmelt
is causing large rises on Island Lake. To prevent further
flooding, Minnesota Power is releasing high flows into the
Cloquet River which should mitigate the overall flood threat
while temporarily increasing the flood threat along the
Cloquet River. Flooding is already occurring in the warned
area.
- More rainfall is expected this weekend, so extra water needs
to be evacuated from Island Lake to maintain control of water
levels in the basin.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Island Lake, Fredenberg, Taft and Fish Lake.

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
