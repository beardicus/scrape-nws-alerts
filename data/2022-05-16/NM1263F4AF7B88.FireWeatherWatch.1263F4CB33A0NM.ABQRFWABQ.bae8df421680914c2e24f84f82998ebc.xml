<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued May 16 at 2:34PM MDT until May 17 at 8:00PM MDT by NWS Albuquerque</headline>
<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FOR THE NORTHEAST HIGHLANDS THROUGH
8 PM MDT DUE TO THE THREAT OF DRY LIGHTNING AND SUDDEN ERRATIC
WIND SHIFTS FROM NEARBY THUNDERSTORMS...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FOR THE EASTERN PLAINS FROM
TUESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH TUESDAY EVENING DUE TO LOW HUMIDITY,
GUSTY WINDS AND AN UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...
.Near critical fire weather conditions will be exacerbated by the
development of scattered dry thunderstorms in the vicinity of the
ongoing Hermit`s Peak/Calf Canyon Fire. Dry lightning, and strong
to potentially severe sudden and erratic wind shifts will
accompany any passing or nearby storm cell. These storms are
expected to develop along the highlands and east slopes of the
central mountain chain, moving eastward toward TX this afternoon.
The potential for sudden wind shifts from storm outflows reaching
the ongoing fire will exist into the early evening before
conditions begin calming by the late evening. Gusty westerly winds
will hit the eastern plains Tuesday afternoon and evening. These
winds, combined with humidity below critical threshold and an
unstable atmosphere, will bring a few hours of critical fire
weather conditions.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
TUESDAY EVENING...
The National Weather Service in Albuquerque has issued a Fire
Weather Watch...which is in effect from Tuesday afternoon through
Tuesday evening.
* AREA AND TIMING...Eastern plains Tuesday afternoon through
Tuesday evening.
* 20 FOOT WINDS...West-southwest at 15 to 20 mph with gusts to
near 30 mph.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...4 to 8 percent.
* IMPACTS...Any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly.
Outdoor burning is not recommended.</description>
