<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT...
The following message is transmitted at the request of the New Mexico
Departments of Health and Environment.
* WHAT...Smoke transport along and east of the Sangre De Cristos may
be complicated through the rest of the afternoon and early evening
by localized strong and gusty outflow winds from nearby
thunderstorms. Otherwise, moderate south and southwesterly transport
winds averaging 15-25 mph will carry smoke from large wildfires
toward the north-northeast until around sunset. Thereafter, typical
nighttime drainage winds will predominate at the local level and
replace this past night`s significant surge of easterly and
northeast winds that impacted many areas and carried smoke into
parts of the Rio Grande Valley. A quick return to drier conditions
expected going into Tuesday with more of a westerly influence to
general smoke transport in wake of a weak disturbance crossing the
state.
* WHERE...Locations most likely to experience the greatest impacts
from smoke include the following counties: Colfax, Mora, western San
Miguel, Socorro, far southeast Catron, and northwest Sierra
counties. Impacted communities include but are not limited to
Chacon, Elephant Butte, Gallinas, Guadalupita, Las Vegas, Magdalena,
Mora, Ocate, Pecos, Sapello, San Antonio, Truth or Consequences, and
Winston.
* WHEN...Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1PM MDT Tuesday,
May 17th.
* IMPACTS...Those with conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and heart
disease will be especially vulnerable to impacts from poor air
quality, as will adults over age 65, young children, and pregnant
women if smoke concentrations become unhealthy.
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to determine
if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method available at
https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/IndoorQuality.html and
https://cv.nmhealth.org
New Mexicans will also need to take steps to keep their homes cool to
avoid heat-related illnesses. NMDOH offers tips here:
