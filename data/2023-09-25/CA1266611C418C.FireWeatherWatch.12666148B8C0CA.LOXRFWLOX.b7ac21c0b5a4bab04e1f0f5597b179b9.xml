<headline>Fire Weather Watch issued September 25 at 1:59PM PDT until September 28 at 5:00AM PDT by NWS Oxnard</headline>
<description>...FIRE WEATHER WATCH FROM 5PM TUESDAY THROUGH 5AM THURSDAY FOR
WIND AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR THE SANTA YNEZ RANGE AND
SURROUNDING FOOTHILLS AND MOUNTAINS...
.A combination of moderately strong northerly pressure gradients,
weak cold advection, and increasing winds aloft will contribute
to the first Fire Weather Watch of the season over the Santa Ynez
Mountain Range. A cold storm system in the Pacific Northwest will
bring the adequate ingredients for a potential red flag event
Tuesday evening through Wednesday night. Sundowners will begin
tonight, but increase and expand from the west to the east Tuesday
evening. Warm and dry conditions will occur in the foothills just
above Santa Barbara and Montecito both Tuesday and Wednesday
evenings with temperatures from 75 to 85 degrees and humidity
lowering to 15 to 25 percent. Gusty north winds of 50 to 60 mph or
possibly higher could lead to rapid fire spread in the foothill
areas. This part of Santa Barbara County is particularly
vulnerable to fires due to dry fuel moisture values at this time
of the year. Stay alert for a potential upgrade to a Red Flag
Warning in later forecasts.
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT FOR WIND AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR THE
SANTA YNEZ RANGE AND SURROUNDING FOOTHILLS AND MOUNTAINS IN SANTA
BARBARA COUNTY...

periods.
* Impacts...If fire ignition occurs there could be rapid spread
of wildfire that would lead to a threat to life and property.</description>

interfaces should prepare now on what to do if a wildfire breaks
