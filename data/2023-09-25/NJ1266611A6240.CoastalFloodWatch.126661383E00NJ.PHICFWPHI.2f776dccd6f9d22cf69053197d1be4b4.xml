<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH TUESDAY EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM TUESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
TUESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
For the Coastal Flood Watch, one to two feet of inundation
above ground level possible in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways.
* WHERE...Coastal Atlantic.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Tuesday evening.
For the Coastal Flood Watch, from Tuesday afternoon through
Tuesday evening.
* IMPACTS...At this level, widespread roadway flooding occurs in
coastal and bayside communities and along inland tidal
waterways. Many roads become impassable. Some damage to
vulnerable structures may begin to occur. Rip currents can
sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Spotty minor flooding is possible with
Monday evening`s high tide, but it is expected to be below
advisory thresholds. Some additional coastal flooding will be
possible with Wednesday evening`s high tide, but water levels
look like they will be somewhat lower than Tuesday.
Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.

<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
