<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued September 25 at 2:49PM EDT until September 25 at 10:00PM EDT by NWS New York City - Upton</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH TUESDAY
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM EDT THIS
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT IN EFFECT FROM 10 PM EDT THIS EVENING
THROUGH TUESDAY AFTERNOON...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM TUESDAY TO MIDNIGHT
EDT TUESDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
For the first Coastal Flood Advisory, up to 1 1/2 foot of
inundation above ground level expected in vulnerable areas near
the waterfront and shoreline. For the Coastal Flood Statement,
up to 1/2 foot of inundation above ground level expected in
vulnerable areas near the waterfront and shoreline. For the
second Coastal Flood Advisory, up to 2 foot of inundation above
ground level expected in vulnerable areas near the waterfront
and shoreline.
* WHERE...Southwest Suffolk and Southern Nassau Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, through Tuesday evening.
For the first Coastal Flood Advisory, until 10 PM EDT this
evening. For the Coastal Flood Statement, from 10 PM EDT this
evening through Tuesday afternoon. For the second Coastal
Flood Advisory, from 2 PM Tuesday to midnight EDT Tuesday
night.
* COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Widespread minor flooding, with up to 1
1/2 ft inundation above ground level is expected in the most
vulnerable locations near the waterfront and shoreline this
afternoon into evening. Localized minor coastal flooding is
expected with late tonight into early tomorrow morning high
tide, where some of the most vulnerable areas may see water sit
or slow to recede even during low tide. Then widespread minor
to locally moderate coastal flooding, with up to 2 feet of
inundation above ground level is expected for the Tuesday
afternoon into evening high tide. This will result in several
road closures and cause widespread flooding of low lying
property including parking lots, parks, lawns and
homes/businesses with basements near the waterfront. Vehicles
parked in vulnerable areas near the waterfront may become
flooded.
* BEACH EROSION AND FLOODING IMPACTS...Breaking waves of 4 to 7
ft will cause beach flooding and erosion, with scattered areas
of dune erosion during the time of high tide. The potential for
localized overwashes is low at this time, limited to the most
compromised dune areas.
* SWIMMING IMPACTS...Life-threatening rip currents are likely for
all people entering the surf zone. Anyone visiting the beaches
should stay out of the surf. Rip currents can sweep even the
best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
the shore and yell or wave for help.</instruction>
