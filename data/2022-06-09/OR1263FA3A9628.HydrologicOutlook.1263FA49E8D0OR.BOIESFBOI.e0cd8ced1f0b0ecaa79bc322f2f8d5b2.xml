<description>...HEAVY RAIN AND HIGH ELEVATION SNOWMELT THIS WEEKEND WILL CAUSE
SHARP RISES ON SMALL RIVERS...CREEKS...AND STREAMS ACROSS THE
WEST CENTRAL AND BOISE MOUNTAINS AND BAKER COUNTY MOUNTAINS...
A very moist Pacific storm system will impact the region this
weekend and bring heavy rain to the West Central and Boise
Mountains in southwest Idaho and the Baker County Mountains in
eastern Oregon. Rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches with locally
higher amounts are expected from Saturday afternoon through
Sunday night.
Runoff from the rain combined with high elevation snowmelt will
cause sharp rises on small rivers, creeks, and streams, with a
risk of mud and rock slides in steep terrain. Areas burned by
wildfire in recent years will be even more vulnerable to excessive
runoff along with mud and rock slides.
Never camp in flood prone areas when heavy rain is forecast.
Campers, hikers, and those planning outdoor activities should
monitor weather conditions and be aware of your surroundings and
move to higher ground if necessary.</description>
