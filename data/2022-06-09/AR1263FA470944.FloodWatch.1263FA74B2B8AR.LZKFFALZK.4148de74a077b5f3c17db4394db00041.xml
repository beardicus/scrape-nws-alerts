* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Heavy rain is expected over areas that have received
significant precipitation over the past several days.
Widespread rainfall of one to three inches will be possible
with locally heavier amounts. The ground is nearly saturated
in many areas from recent rain. The ground is simply unable
to absorb any more water, which will lead to runoff issues
and subsequent flooding concerns.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
