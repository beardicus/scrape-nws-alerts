<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT...
The following message is transmitted at the request of the New Mexico
Departments of Health and Environment, United States Forest Service
and the Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality Response Program.
* WHAT...Lighter and more variable transport winds in the vicinity of
the Black fire will keep significant impacts from new smoke in close
proximity to its perimeter through Friday morning. Considerable haze
and light smoke aloft that contributed to moderate impacts farther
north and east during the past 12 hours particularly along and west
of the central mountain chain will continue to disperse through the
remainder of the afternoon. Transport winds broadly from the
southwest and west through this evening will shift more from the
northwest on Friday. New fires from lightning may also contribute
to additional smoke to regional airsheds going into the day Friday
as the weather trends hotter and drier.
* WHERE...Smoke impacts will be most significant and widespread in
Catron, northern Grant, western Sierra and western Socorro counties.
This includes but is not limited to the following locations:
Hillsboro, Kingston, San Lorenzo, Lake Roberts, Winston and the Gila
Cliff Dwellings. Outflow winds from thunderstorm activity will
further complicate smoke trajectories over and near the Gila National
Forest, especially areas west and north of the fire. More details and
latest air quality information can be found at
https://fire.airnow.gov.
* WHEN...Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1 PM MDT Friday
June 10.
* IMPACTS...Those with conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and heart
disease will be especially vulnerable to impacts from poor air
quality, as will adults over age 65, young children, and pregnant
women if smoke concentrations become unhealthy.
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method available
at https://nmtracking.doh.nm.gov/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
https://nmtracking.doh.nm.gov/environment/air/IndoorQuality.html and
https://cv.nmhealth.org
New Mexicans will also need to take steps to keep their homes cool to
avoid heat-related illnesses. NMDOH offers tips here:
