<description>...HEAVY RAINFALL TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY WITH RISING STREAMS
AND RIVERS...
Heavy rain is expected over the Cascades tonight through early
Saturday and then across the Blue Mountains and portions of eastern
Oregon and Washington Saturday Saturday into Sunday.
The heaviest rain looks to occur tonight into early Friday for the
Washington Cascades during the day Friday for the Oregon Cascades
during the day Saturday over eastern Oregon, with a second round on
Sunday.
Rainfall amounts of 0.50 to 1.00 inches are expected across the
outlook area, with higher amounts possible over the mountains.
Rivers continue to run high across all of southeast Washington and
central and northeast Oregon due to the recent wet conditions.
The additional rainfall is expected to bring the Naches River close
to or above flood stage and bring rises on portions of the Yakima
River.  Additionally, many rivers remain close to or above bankfull
and will continue to run fast and high.
Campers, hikers and those planning outdoor activities should keep
advised of developing showers and seek higher ground, if necessary.
Never camp along streams, rivers and creeks.  Keep an eye on
children and pets to make sure they do not get too close to the
water`s edge.</description>
