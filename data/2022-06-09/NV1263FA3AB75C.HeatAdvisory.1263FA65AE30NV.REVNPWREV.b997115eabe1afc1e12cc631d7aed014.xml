<headline>Heat Advisory issued June 09 at 2:43PM PDT until June 11 at 8:00PM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...HEAT ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM FRIDAY TO 8 PM PDT
SATURDAY...
* WHAT...High temperatures 95 to 100 expected both Friday and
Saturday.
* WHERE...Mineral and Southern Lyon Counties including
Yerington, and Western Nevada Basin and Range including
Pyramid Lake, Fallon, Lovelock, and Hawthorne.
* WHEN...From 10 AM Friday to 8 PM PDT Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Hot temperatures and sunny skies may cause heat
illnesses to occur, especially for those sensitive to heat and
outdoors for extended periods of time. Since this is the first
heat event of the summer season, many people are not yet
acclimatized to heat and may be impacted more than normal.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...These are potentially record setting
highs for both dates, and unusually early to be so close to
100 degrees. The average first 100 degrees for Fallon isn`t
until July 6th.</description>
<instruction>Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
