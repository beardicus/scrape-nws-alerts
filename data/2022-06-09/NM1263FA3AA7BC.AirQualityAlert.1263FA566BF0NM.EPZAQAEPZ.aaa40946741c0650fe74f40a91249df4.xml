<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM THIS EVENING TO 1 PM MDT
FRIDAY...
The New Mexico Departments of Health and Environment has issued an
Air Quality Alert, from 6 PM this evening to 1 PM MDT Friday.
* WHAT... Lighter and more variable transport winds in the vicinity
of the Black fire will keep significant impacts from new smoke in
close proximity to its perimeter through Friday morning.
Considerable haze and light smoke aloft that contributed to
moderate impacts farther north and east during the past 12 hours,
particularly along and west the central mountain chain, will
continue to disperse through the remainder of the afternoon.
Transport winds broadly from the southwest or west through this
evening will shift more from the northwest on Friday. New fires
from lightning may also contribute to additional smoke to regional
airsheds going into the day Friday as the weather trends hotter and
drier.
* WHERE... Smoke impacts will be most significant and widespread in
Catron, northern Grant, western Sierra and western Socorro
counties. This includes, but is not limited to, the following
locations: Hillsboro, Kingston, San Lorenzo, Lake Roberts, Winston
and the Gila Cliff Dwellings. Outflow winds from thunderstorm
activity will further complicate smoke trajectories over and near
the Gila National Forest, especially areas west and north of the
fire. More details and latest air quality information can be found
at https://fire.airnow.gov
* WHEN... Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1pm MDT
Friday, June 10th.</description>
