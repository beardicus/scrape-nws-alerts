<description>...ELEVATED RISK OF WILDFIRE SPREAD ACROSS NORTHEAST PENNSYLVANIA THIS
AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING...
A combination of low relative humidity, gusty westerly winds, and
dry fine fuels will lead to an elevated risk for fire spread with
any potential fire starts this afternoon across Northeast Pennsylvania.
Despite some clouds moving in today, relative humidity values
are expected to drop to between 20 to 30 percent across all of NE
PA this afternoon. West winds increase between 8 to 15 mph with
gusts of 20 to 25 mph by late afternoon and early evening. Some
grasses and other fine fuels will begin to dry out, elevating the
risk for fire spread.
Everyone is urged to exercise caution if handling any potential
ignition source, including machinery, cigarettes, and matches. Be
sure to properly discard all smoking materials. Any dry grasses,
dead leaves, and other tree litter that ignite will have the
potential to spread fire quickly.
For more information about wildfire danger, burn restrictions,
and wildfire prevention and eduction, please visit your state`s
forestry or environmental protection website.</description>
