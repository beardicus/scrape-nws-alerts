.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 321 PM CDT Tue Apr 11 2023
Mixing continues to over perform today with favorable southerly
to southwesterly winds continuing to allow for significantly
warmer and drier air to pool down to the surface. As a result,
temperatures have warmed into the upper 70s and low 80s this
afternoon. Winds have also over performed with sustained
southwesterly winds in the 20-25 mph range and gusts between 30-40
mph being reported. Relative humidity values have fallen to the
15 to 25 percent range, resulting in a large part of the area
seeing near critical to critical fire weather conditions. Expect
these conditions to continue through sunset tonight as the Red
Flag Warning expires.
Similar conditions are expected Wednesday and Thursday with a slight
southeasterly shift in the main ingredients. As a result, a Red Flag
Warning and Fire Weather Watch have been issued for parts of the
area on Wednesday. The Red Flag Warning includes most of
northwestern IA, far southeast SD, and far northeast NE. The Fire
Weather Watch includes portions of southeastern SD, northwestern
IA, and southwestern MN. Both the watch and warning go into
effect starting at 1 pm and continue through 7 pm.
People are urged to exercise extreme care with respect to outdoor
activities that could cause grass fires. Avoid equipment that can
cause sparks near dry grass or brush. Do not toss cigarettes on
the ground. Report new fires quickly to the nearest fire
department or law enforcement office.
...EXTREME FIRE DANGER...
The Grassland Fire Danger Index will reach the extreme category
this afternoon. Extreme weather conditions and very low
moisture content of grasses, and other dry organic material
on the ground, indicate that critical burning conditions exist.
All fires have the potential to become large and spread quickly,
becoming erratic with extreme behavioral characteristics.
No outdoor burning should take place.
OUTLOOK FOR WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...The Grassland Fire Danger Index
will reach the extreme category.
The grassland fire danger product reflects fire danger for native
grasses. It is not intended for cured agricultural crops, nor
will it reflect conditions in road ditches which have been mowed.</description>
