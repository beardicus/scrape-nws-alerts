<headline>Flood Watch issued April 11 at 10:57AM EDT until April 12 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Miami</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT THROUGH WEDNESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of South Florida, including the following areas,
Coastal Broward, Coastal Miami-Dade, Metro Broward and Metro
Miami-Dade.
* WHEN...Through Wednesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The PWAT values this morning were in the 1.5 to 1.6 inches
and the short range models are showing the PWAT values will
be increasing to 1.6 to 1.8 inches tonight into tomorrow over
the region. These PWAT values are near the 90th percentile
for this time of year leading to possible heavy rainfall with
any storms that do move through the area today into
Wednesday.
Miami-Dade and Broward Counties have also seen between 2 to 5
inches with isolated areas seeing up to 7 inches of rainfall
during the last couple of days. This has lead to the grounds
becoming saturated over the region. Therefore, any additional
heavy rainfall will lead to possible flooding conditions and
a Flood Watch has been issued for metro and coastal Miami-
Dade and Broward Counties through Wednesday evening.

to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
