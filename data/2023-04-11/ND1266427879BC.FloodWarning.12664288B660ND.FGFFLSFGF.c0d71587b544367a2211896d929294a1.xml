.Temperatures above freezing over the last several days is starting
the snow melt. High temperatures over the next several days will
range from the low 50s to the upper 60s in forested areas. This is
expected to further ripen the snow pack and, with anticipated
melting, will cause increased flows of water into the rivers
resulting in rapid rises. There will be variations as to degree of
snow melt depending on how high temperatures will get over the next
several days. At this time, precipitation will be limited. However,
if rainfall occurs later toward the weekend, it will have an impact
on forecast rises.
