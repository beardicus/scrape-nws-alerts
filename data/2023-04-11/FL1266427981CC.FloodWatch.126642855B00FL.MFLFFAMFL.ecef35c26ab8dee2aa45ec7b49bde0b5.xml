<headline>Flood Watch issued April 11 at 6:35PM EDT until April 11 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Miami</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH WEDNESDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of South Florida, including the following areas,
Coastal Broward, Coastal Miami-Dade, Metro Broward and Metro
Miami-Dade.
* WHEN...Through Wednesday evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The latest short range model guidance continues to show PWAT
values increasing to 1.6 to 1.8 inches tonight into tomorrow
over the region. These PWAT values are near the 90th
percentile for this time of year leading to possible heavy
rainfall with any storms that do move through the area
tonight into Wednesday.
Miami-Dade and Broward Counties have also seen between 2 to 5
inches of rain with isolated areas seeing up to 7 inches of
rainfall during the last couple of days. This has lead to the
grounds becoming saturated over the region. Therefore, any
additional heavy rainfall will lead to possible flooding
conditions and a Flood Watch has been issued for metro and
coastal Miami-Dade and Broward Counties through Wednesday
evening.
