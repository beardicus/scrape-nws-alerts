<description>...Foothills flooding possible due to rapid snowmelt...
With recent warm temperatures, expect continuing increased snowmelt
over area foothills. Between 5000 feet and 7000 feet snowpack is
currently near to above record levels, with 8 to 15 inches of water
contained within this snow. With the ground mainly frozen in the
foothills, this water will not be able to soak in and
will run off. Water flowing downhill and accumulating in low lying
areas may result in localized flooding.  Water flowing into creeks
and streams will also increase the potential for ice jam development
and may result in additional flooding near waterways.
Water may accumulate near home foundations increasing the chance of
basement flooding. Plugged culverts, ditches, and storm drains may
result in water flowing over and possibly eroding roadways in spots.
Smaller streams will see the greatest rises, and stream conditions
will see rapid changes which could present difficulties for those
recreating in the foothills. Unpaved roads may suddenly thaw and
become muddy and impassable.
While flooding is not imminent, continue to monitor water levels and
be prepared to move equipment and livestock out of low lying areas,
and away from waterways. Do not drive over flooded roadways, as the
roadbed may be washed out. Be especially careful driving at night
when water covered roadways are less visible.
Recreationists should expect changing conditions and use extra
caution near waterways.
Stay tuned to the forecast for the latest temperature and
precipitation trends, along with any warnings or advisories that may
be issued. Please report any flooding to local law enforcement and
have them relay the report to the National Weather Service.</description>
