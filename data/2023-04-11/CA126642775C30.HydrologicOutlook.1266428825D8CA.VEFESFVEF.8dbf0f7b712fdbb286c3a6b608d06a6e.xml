<description>...Water levels rising in creeks and streams in Inyo County...
Snowmelt in the southern Sierra Nevada of Inyo County will start to
accelerate with the onset of warmer temperatures. Creeks, streams,
and rivers will begin experiencing higher flows that will likely
continue for weeks.
As creeks swell, some campgrounds will be at risk of flooding. Roads
used to access campgrounds and hiking trailheads will also be at
risk of flooding. Remember, never drive through flooded roadways or
around barricades. Pastureland or farmland adjacent to creeks,
streams, and rivers could experience areas of flooding and a
prolonged period of standing water.
For further information on Inyo National Forest Campgrounds go to:
fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd486882.pdf.
Due to their swift currents and very cold water temperatures, creeks
and streams pose life-threatening dangers. Extra caution should be
exercised as exhaustion or unconsciousness from hypothermia could
set in quickly. Always wear a properly fitted life jacket for all
water activities.
