<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT STARTING AT NOON TODAY THROUGH
9 PM FOR WIND AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR MUCH OF SOUTH
CENTRAL AND SOUTHEAST SOUTH DAKOTA, NORTHWEST IOWA AND FAR
NORTHEAST NEBRASKA...
.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 238 AM CDT Tue Apr 11 2023
Ample mixing within a favorable southwest flow today
will allow anomalously warm mid level temperatures to the surface and
result in widespread 80s to perhaps near 90 this afternoon, a bit
cooler over areas with remaining snowcover. This mixing will also
help pull down higher momentum air in the form of southwesterly
winds gusting 30-35 mph, with isolated gusts closer to 40 mph not
out of the question. Afternoon relative humidity values will fall
quickly by late morning into critical threshold of 10-25%. Going Red
Flag Warning still looks valid although did expand into Beadle
County where it appears enough of the area has been snow free for
long enough to allow for suitable fuel conditions. Counties
bordering the Red Flag Warning may also see meteorological
conditions approach critical thresholds, there is just higher
uncertainty with fuel status given more recent snow melt or even
remaining snowcover.
Similar conditions are expected for Wednesday and Thursday, with
perhaps a slight southeast shift where the main focus is as a
boundary works into central and northeastern South Dakota. Will very
likely need additional headlines for mid week but will handle one
day at a time.
People are urged to exercise extreme care with respect to outdoor
activities that could cause grass fires. Avoid equipment that can
cause sparks near dry grass or brush. Do not toss cigarettes on
the ground. Report new fires quickly to the nearest fire
department or law enforcement office.
...EXTREME FIRE DANGER...
The Grassland Fire Danger Index will reach the extreme category
this afternoon. Extreme weather conditions and very low
moisture content of grasses, and other dry organic material
on the ground, indicate that critical burning conditions exist.
All fires have the potential to become large and spread quickly,
becoming erratic with extreme behavioral characteristics.
No outdoor burning should take place.
OUTLOOK FOR WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...The Grassland Fire Danger Index
will reach the very high category.
The grassland fire danger product reflects fire danger for native
grasses. It is not intended for cured agricultural crops, nor
will it reflect conditions in road ditches which have been mowed.</description>
