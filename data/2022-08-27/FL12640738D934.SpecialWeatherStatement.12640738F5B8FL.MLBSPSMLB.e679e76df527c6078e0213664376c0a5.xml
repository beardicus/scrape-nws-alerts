<description>...A strong thunderstorm will impact portions of north central

capable of producing a waterspout over West Lake Toho, moving east
at 15 mph.
HAZARD...Waterspouts and winds in excess of 40 mph.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Waterspouts can easily overturn boats and create locally
hazardous waters. Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs
and blow around unsecured objects.
Locations impacted include...
Kissimmee, Saint Cloud, East Lake Toho, West Lake Toho and Osceola
Heritage Park.
WATERSPOUT...POSSIBLE
MAX HAIL SIZE...0.00 IN
MAX WIND GUST...40 MPH</description>
<instruction>If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.
Conditions are favorable for the development of weak, brief funnel
clouds. These types of funnel clouds on rare occasions they can
briefly touch down, producing wind gusts over 50 mph. If a funnel
cloud is spotted move indoors and report your sighting to the
National Weather Service.
Torrential rainfall is also occurring with this storm and may lead to
localized flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flooded
roadways.
If on or near West Lake Toho, get out of the water and move indoors
or inside a vehicle. Remember, lightning can strike out to 10 miles
from the parent thunderstorm. If you can hear thunder, you are close
enough to be struck by lightning. Move to safe shelter now! Do not
be caught on the water in a thunderstorm.</instruction>
