<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued February 27 at 3:10AM EST until February 28 at 1:00PM EST by NWS Binghamton</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM THIS EVENING
TO 1 PM EST TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow accumulations
of 4 to 6 inches and ice accumulations of a light glaze. Winds
gusting as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...Tioga county.
* WHEN...From 6 PM this evening to 1 PM EST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous
conditions could impact the evening commute today or the
Tuesday morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow will move in early this evening and
quickly produce heavy snowfall rates up to 1 inch per hour until
midnight. The combination of snow and some sleet or freezing
rain mixing in and gusty winds with blowing snow will create
hazardous travel conditions with slippery roads likely. The snow
will be wet with a high water content...making shoveling very
difficult. The snow will taper off Tuesday morning before ending
in the afternoon.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling.
The latest road conditions for the state you are calling from can
be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
