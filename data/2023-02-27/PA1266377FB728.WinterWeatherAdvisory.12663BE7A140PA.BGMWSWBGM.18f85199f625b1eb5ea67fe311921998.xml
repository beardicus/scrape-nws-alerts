<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued February 27 at 3:10AM EST until February 28 at 7:00PM EST by NWS Binghamton</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 PM THIS
EVENING TO 7 PM EST TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow accumulations
of 4 to 7 inches and ice accumulations of a light glaze. Winds
gusting as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...In New York, Onondaga, Madison, Cortland, Chenango and
Broome counties. In Pennsylvania, Susquehanna county.
* WHEN...From 6 PM this evening to 7 PM EST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery, snow-covered road conditions. The
hazardous conditions could impact the evening commute today and
the Tuesday morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow will move in early this evening and
quickly produce heavy snowfall rates up to 1.5 inches per hour
into the early overnight hours. The combination of snow and some
sleet or freezing rain mixing in and gusty winds with blowing
snow will create hazardous travel conditions with slippery roads
likely. The snow will be wet with a high water content...making
shoveling very difficult. The snow will taper off late Tuesday
morning before ending late in the afternoon.</description>
