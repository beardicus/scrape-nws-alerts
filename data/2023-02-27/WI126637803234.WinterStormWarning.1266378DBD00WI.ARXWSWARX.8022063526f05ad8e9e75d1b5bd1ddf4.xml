<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued February 27 at 5:25AM CST until February 27 at 6:00PM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Freezing Rain This Morning...
.Freezing rain is quickly surging northeast across the area early
this morning, and will move north of highway 29 in north-central
Wisconsin before 7 am. Untreated surfaces, including roads and
sidewalks, will quickly accrue ice.
Warmer air is also moving north, which will help limit the amount
of freezing rain that will impact a location. Currently, warmer
air is expected to reach the I-94 corridor by 8 am. Additional
icing should end there, but surfaces could still be icy. North
of there, freezing rain could persist for most of the morning.
There will be a change over to snow for the afternoon north of
highway 29 in north-central Wisconsin, with 1 to 2 inch
accumulations.
Temperatures will play a key role in icing amounts. Small changes
could result in substantial shifts in impacts. Pay close
attention to the forecast for any revisions.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM CST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Freezing rain this morning, transitioning to snow in the
afternoon. Ice accumulations from 2 to 4 tenths of an inch.
Snow accumulations of 1 to 2&quot;. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.
* WHERE...Taylor and Clark Counties.
* WHEN...Until 6 PM CST this evening.
* IMPACTS...Power outages and tree damage are likely due to the
ice. Travel could be nearly impossible. The hazardous conditions
will impact the morning and evening commutes.</description>
