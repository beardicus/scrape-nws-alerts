<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued February 27 at 5:25AM CST until February 27 at 12:00PM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Freezing Rain This Morning...
.Freezing rain is quickly surging northeast across the area early
this morning, and will move north of highway 29 in north-central
Wisconsin before 7 am. Untreated surfaces, including roads and
sidewalks, will quickly accrue ice.
Warmer air is also moving north, which will help limit the amount
of freezing rain that will impact a location. Currently, warmer
air is expected to reach the I-94 corridor by 8 am. Additional
icing should end there, but surfaces could still be icy. North
of there, freezing rain could persist for most of the morning.
There will be a change over to snow for the afternoon north of
highway 29 in north-central Wisconsin, with 1 to 2 inch
accumulations.
Temperatures will play a key role in icing amounts. Small changes
could result in substantial shifts in impacts. Pay close
attention to the forecast for any revisions.
...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST
TODAY...
* WHAT...Freezing rain, mostly along and north of interstate 94.
