<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued February 27 at 3:25AM CST until February 27 at 6:00PM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Freezing Rain This Morning...
.A potent, quick moving storm system will bring freezing rain to
parts of the region this morning, generally around and north of
the Interstate 94 corridor. The freezing rain transitions to snow
in the afternoon, with most of those impacts holding north of
Highway 29 in north-central Wisconsin.
The freezing rain will reach the I-94 corridor by 5 am, continuing
to spread northward and nearing Highway 10 in north-central
Wisconsin by 7 am. Untreated surfaces, including roads and
sidewalks, will quickly accrue ice.
The freezing rain will generally persist for about 2 to 3 hours
near I-94 before warmer temperatures start to move in. North of
there, freezing rain could persist through most of the morning.
There will be a change over to snow for the afternoon north of
highway 29 in north-central Wisconsin, with 1 to 2 inch
accumulations.
Temperatures will play a key role in icing amounts. Small changes
could result in substantial shifts in impacts. Pay close
attention to the forecast for any revisions.
...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM CST THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Freezing rain this morning, transitioning to snow in the
