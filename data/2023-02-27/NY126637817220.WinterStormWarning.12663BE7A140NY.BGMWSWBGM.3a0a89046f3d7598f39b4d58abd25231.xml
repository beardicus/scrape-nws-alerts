mph.

counties.
* WHEN...From 6 PM this evening to 7 PM EST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult...especially along I-

will likely impact the evening commute today and possibly the
Tuesday morning commute.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snowfall rates as high as 1.5 inches per
hour are expected this evening and into the early overnight
hours. The combination of heavy snow and blowing snow will
create hazardous travel conditions. The snow will be wet with
a high water content...making shoveling very difficult. The
snow will taper off slowly late Tuesday morning and eventually
end by the afternoon.</description>
