<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM AST TUESDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH FRIDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Dangerous surf conditions and rip currents expected due
to breaking waves of up to around 10 feet. Localized beach
erosion and coastal flooding are possible.
* WHERE...Beaches of Aguada and Rincon, Culebra and St Thomas
and St John.
* WHEN...For the High Surf, through 6 AM AST Friday. For the High
Risk of Rip Currents, through Friday afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper waters. Dangerous swimming conditions.
Hazardous breaking waves.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.</instruction>
