<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued February 27 at 11:15AM PST until February 28 at 4:00AM PST by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM PST
TUESDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of up to two
inches, except for 5 to 10 inches across western Mineral and
far southern Lyon counties. Winds gusting as high as 50 mph.
* WHERE...Mineral and Southern Lyon Counties.
* WHEN...From 1 PM Monday to 4 AM PST Tuesday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Reduced visibility
is possible due to blowing snow. The hazardous conditions
could impact the evening commute. Gusty winds could bring down
tree branches.</description>
<instruction>Even light snowfall causes major travel delays, especially during
periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow extra time to
reach your destination. Leave extra space between vehicles since
it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.
The latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</instruction>
