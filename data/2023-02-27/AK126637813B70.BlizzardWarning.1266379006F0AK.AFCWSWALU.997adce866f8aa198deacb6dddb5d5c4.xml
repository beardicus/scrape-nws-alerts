* WHAT...Blizzard conditions expected. Total snow accumulations
of 6 to 10 inches. Locally higher amounts over Nunivak Island.

could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 30
minutes.</description>

expected or occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds
and poor visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout
conditions, making travel very hazardous. If you must travel,
have a winter survival kit with you.If you get stranded, stay
with your vehicle.</instruction>
