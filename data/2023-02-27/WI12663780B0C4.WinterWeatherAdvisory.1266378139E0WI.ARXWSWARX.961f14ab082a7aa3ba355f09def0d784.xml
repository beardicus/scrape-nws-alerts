<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued February 27 at 8:49AM CST until February 27 at 12:00PM CST by NWS LaCrosse</headline>
<description>...Freezing Rain This Morning...
.Freezing rain has spread northeastward through the region this
morning. Slick road conditions have been observed for portions of
southeast Minnesota thought western/north central Wisconsin. Several
slide offs have been reported. Even with air temperatures slowly
climbing above freezing throughout this morning, ground
temperatures holding near freezing would lead to icy conditions to
linger into the late morning. North of I-94, freezing conditions
will persist into the afternoon, but an eventual change over to
snow for areas north of highway 29 in north-central Wisconsin.
Accumulations of 1 to 2 inches is anticipated by this evening.
Temperatures will play a key role in icing amounts. Small changes
could result in substantial shifts in impacts. Pay close
attention to the forecast for any revisions. Roads that appear wet
may actually be icy.
