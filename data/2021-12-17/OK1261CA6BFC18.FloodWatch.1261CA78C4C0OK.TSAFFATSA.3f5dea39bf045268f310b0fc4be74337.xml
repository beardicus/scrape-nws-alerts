<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is likely in some
areas.
* WHERE...Portions of Arkansas and Oklahoma, including the following
counties, in Arkansas, Benton, Carroll, Crawford, Franklin,
Madison, Sebastian and Washington AR. In Oklahoma, Adair,
Cherokee, Haskell, Latimer, Le Flore, McIntosh, Muskogee,
Pittsburg and Sequoyah.
* WHEN...Through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Some creeks and streams will likely rise out of their
banks. River flooding will be possible, especially in the Illinois
river basin.  Low-water crossings will likely become flooded with
extensive street flooding in some locations. Area creeks and
streams are running high and will flood with more heavy rain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A frontal boundary located just south of I-40 will stall
later this afternoon. Strong lift along with record
precipitable water values, and the potential for training of
storms will lead to a zone of heavy rainfall through tonight
across the watch area. Widespread 3-4 inches with localized
5-6 inch amounts are possible. A few areas that receive the
highest rainfall totals could experience significant
flooding. The flooding threat will begin to decrease late
tonight as storms shift southeast of the region.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
