<headline>Flood Watch issued December 17 at 2:22PM CST until December 17 at 7:15PM CST by NWS Tulsa</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE TONIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of northeast Oklahoma, including the following
county, Delaware.
* WHEN...Through late tonight.
* IMPACTS...Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks.
Low-water crossings may be flooded. Extensive street flooding and
flooding of creeks and rivers are possible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- A frontal boundary located just south of I-40 will stall
later this afternoon. Strong lift along with record
precipitable water values, and the potential for training of
storms will lead to a zone of heavy rainfall through tonight
across the watch area. Widespread 2 inches with localized 4
inch amounts are possible. The flooding threat will begin to
decrease by midnight as storms shift southeast of the region.

to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
