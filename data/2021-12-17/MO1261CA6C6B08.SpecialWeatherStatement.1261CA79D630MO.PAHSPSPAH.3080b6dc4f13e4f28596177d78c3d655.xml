<headline>Special Weather Statement issued December 17 at 5:06PM CST  by NWS Paducah</headline>
<description>...LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL TONIGHT INTO SATURDAY MORNING...
Showers will continue tonight, along with a few thunderstorms,
mainly in locations along and north of the Ohio River. Rainfall
totals will likely range from 1 to 2 inches in those areas, but
some locally higher amounts will be possible if thunderstorms
manage to repeat over the same locations.
Farther south across much of western Kentucky, amounts closer to
one half to one inch are expected. It should be noted, however,
that some minor flooding could still possibly occur in tornado
ravaged areas of western Kentucky, due to debris possibly clogging
some of the area drainage systems.
In addition, areas fog, possibly dense at times, may develop over
the Purchase area of western Kentucky, far southeast Missouri and
the southern tip of Illinois for a few hours this evening as a
warm front lifts north into the region. Motorists should be
prepared for visibilities well below a mile at times.</description>
