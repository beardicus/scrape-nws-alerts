        <headline>Air Quality Alert issued April 25 at 3:00PM PDT by NWS San Diego CA</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...The South Coast AQMD has issued an air quality alert due to harmful levels of particle pollution from windblown dust.

* WHERE...in the Coachella Valley. Levels of particle pollution can vary by time and location depending on emissions and local weather conditions.

* WHEN...until late Saturday night.

* IMPACTS... Particle pollution can get deep into the lungs and cause serious health problems such as asthma attacks, heart and lung disease symptoms, and increased risk of lung infections. Everyone can be affected, but sensitive groups such as people with lung or heart disease, older adults, people who are pregnant, children, and those who spend a lot of time outdoors are at greater risk.
</description>
        <instruction>To protect your health, check air quality levels and act as needed:

* When Air Quality Index (AQI) levels are "Unhealthy for Sensitive
Groups" (orange), sensitive groups as specified above should limit
extended or intense outdoor activity.
* When AQI is "Unhealthy" (red), everyone may experience health
impacts. Sensitive groups should avoid extended time outdoors.
* When AQI is "Very Unhealthy" (purple), sensitive groups should avoid
all outdoor physical activity. Everyone else should avoid extended
or intense outdoor activity.
* When AQI is "Hazardous" (maroon), everyone should avoid all outdoor
physical activity.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...

To help keep indoor air clean when air quality is poor:

* Keep windows and doors closed
* Run your air conditioner and/or an air purifier
* Do not use whole house fans or swamp coolers that bring in outside
air if you have other methods to stay cool
* Avoid other sources of pollution such as fireplaces, candles,
incense, grilling, and gasoline-powered lawn and garden equipment

To help minimize outdoor particle pollution levels:

* Carpool, telecommute, reduce trips, or take public transportation
* Slow down if driving on dirt roads
* Stabilize loose soils
