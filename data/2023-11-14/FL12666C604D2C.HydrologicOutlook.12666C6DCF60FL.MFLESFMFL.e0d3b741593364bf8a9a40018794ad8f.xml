<description>!!!MODERATE RISK OF FLOODING MIAMI-DADE/BROWARD COUNTIES WEDNESDAY!!!
...Slight Risk Of Flooding Palm Beach County And Interior Areas Wednesday...
The short-range models continue to show a mid to upper level trough of
low pressure over the Gulf of Mexico moving east into the Florida
Peninsula Wednesday into Wednesday night. At the same time, the models
are now showing a non-tropical surface low to develop over South allowing
for a warm front over the Florida Keys to move northward into South Florida.
This weather pattern will allow for a southwest steering flow to set
up over South Florida allowing for deep tropical moisture to work into
the area from the Southern Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. At
the same time, the surface winds will be east northeast allowing for
low level moisture to work into the east coast metro areas. These two
sources of moisture will allow for the PWAT values to increase to 2.1
to 2.3 inches, which are near the maximum PWAT values for this time
of year over South Florida.
Therefore, it looks like heavy rainfall is becoming more likely over the
eastern areas of South Florida on Wednesday into Wednesday night. At
this time, it looks like 5 to 7 inches are possible over the eastern
areas of South Florida through Thursday morning with possible isolated
amounts of 10 inches or greater where any heavy rainfall set up do
to training over the same area.
Weather Prediction Center (WPC) has raised the flooding treat to MODERATE
RISK for coastal and metro Broward and Miami-Dade Counties with a
Slight Flooding Risk for Palm Beach County and the interior areas
of South Florida.
A Flood Watch is also in effect through Thursday morning for all of the
east coast metro areas of South Florida.</description>
