<headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued November 14 at 2:57PM CST until November 15 at 12:00AM CST by NWS Brownsville</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM CST THIS
EVENING...
...COASTAL FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT CST TONIGHT...
...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT IS CANCELLED...
* WHAT...For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents.
For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding
expected.
* WHERE...Kenedy Island, Willacy Island and Cameron Island
Counties.
* WHEN...For the High Rip Current Risk, until 6 PM CST this
evening. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until midnight CST
tonight.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding is expected, with water reaching or
pushing into the dunes on South Padre Island. Vehicles, except
those with four wheel drive and high wheel bases, will be unable
to be driven on the beach. This includes locations north of
Public Beach Access #3. Minor to moderate beach erosion is
expected. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water.</description>
<instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
