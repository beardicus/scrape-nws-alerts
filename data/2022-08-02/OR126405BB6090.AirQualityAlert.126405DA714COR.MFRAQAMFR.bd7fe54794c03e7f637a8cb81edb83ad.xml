<headline>Air Quality Alert issued August 02 at 12:56PM PDT  by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM PDT FRIDAY...
The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality continues the air
quality advisory through Friday August 5 for Jackson and Klamath
Counties due to smoke from the McKinney fire in Siskiyou County, near
Yreka, California.
DEQ expects the air quality advisory to last until at least Friday,
Aug. 5. DEQ and partner agencies will continue to monitor smoke in
the area.
Smoke levels can change rapidly depending on weather. Check current
conditions on the Oregon Smoke Information Blog, DEQ’s Air Quality
Index, or by downloading the free OregonAIR app on your smartphone.
Smoke can irritate the eyes and lungs and worsen some medical
conditions. People most at risk include infants and young children,
people with heart or lung disease, older adults and pregnant people.
Protect yourself and your family when smoke levels are high:
Stay inside if possible. Keep windows and doors closed. If it’s
too hot, run air conditioning on recirculate or consider moving to a
cooler location. Avoid strenuous outdoor activity.
Use a high effeciencey particulate air filter in indoor ventilation
systems or portable air purifiers.
Be aware of smoke in your area and avoid places with the highest
levels.
When air quality improves to moderate or healthy (yellow or green on
the Air Quality Index), open windows and doors to air out homes and
businesses.
If you have a breathing plan for a medical condition, be sure to
follow it and keep any needed meidcations refilled.
N95 or P100 respirators approved by NIOSH may offer protection, but
they must be properly selected and worn. Select a NIOSH-approved
respirator with a N, R, or P alongside the number 95, 99 or 100.
Learn how to put on and use a respirator. Respirators won’t work
for children as they don’t come in children’s sizes. People with
heart or lung conditions should consult their health care provider
before wearing a respirator.
