<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.

creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.</instruction>
