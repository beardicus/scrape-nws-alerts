<description>...FLASH FLOOD WATCH FOR THE MCKINNEY FIRE AND YETI COMPLEX BURN
SCAR REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM PDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding and debris flows caused by excessive
rainfall continue to be possible over the McKinney Fire and Yeti
Complex burn scar.
* WHERE...A portion of northern California, including the following
areas, Central Siskiyou County and Western Siskiyou County.
* WHEN...Until 11 PM PDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Heavy rainfall over the McKinney Fire and Yeti Complex
burn scars. Periods of heavy rain are expected with thunderstorms
today during the period of the watch. Residents and those who are
in or near the McKinney Fire and Yeti Complex burn scar should
prepare for potential flooding impacts. Be sure to stay up to date
with information from local authorities. Heavy rainfall could
trigger flash flooding of low-lying areas, urbanized street
flooding, and debris flows in and near recent wildfire burn scars.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Thunderstorms that form over these fires today, will likely
produce very heavy rainfall that could trigger rock falls or
debris flows. Any person in narrow canyons or on steep slopes
that have been burned should immediately leave these areas
when rain begins. Firefighters should check in with their
safety officer and incident meteorologist for more
information.
