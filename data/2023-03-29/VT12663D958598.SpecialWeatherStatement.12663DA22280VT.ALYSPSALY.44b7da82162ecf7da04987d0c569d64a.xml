<description>...Dangerous Travel Conditions Due to Snow Squalls and Flash
Freeze This Evening...
A period of initial rain changing to snow or sleet with embedded
snow squalls and even rumbles of thunder is expected late this
afternoon into this evening as a strong cold front races from
northwest to southeast through the region.
Strong west to northwest wind gusts up to 40 to 50mph are
expected which when combined with falling snow will likely result
in rapid reductions to visibility and dangerous travel conditions,
especially on high speed highways, due to quickly falling temperatures.
A flash freeze is also possible which would lead to icy roads.
Precautionary/Preparedness Actions...
Be prepared for brief whiteout conditions. This could lead to
dangerous driving conditions, especially on high speed highways.
Icy conditions are also possible on any untreated roads. If you
are traveling and encounter adverse winter driving conditions,
reduce speed and make sure headlights are on.</description>
