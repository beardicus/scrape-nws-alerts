<description>...Dangerous Snow Squalls Likely Tonight...
Snow squalls will be embedded in a line of heavy precipitation
moving eastward through northern New York between 7 PM and 10 PM and
Vermont between 9 PM and midnight. Expect rapidly changing
conditions which will include very low visibilities, especially at
higher elevations. At lower elevations, precipitation may
initially be rain before changing to snow. Overnight, temperatures
falling below freezing and gusty winds may additionally cause
very difficult travel where snow accumulates.
Precautionary/Preparedness Actions...
Be prepared for areas of blowing and drifting snow. This could
lead to temporary whiteout conditions and the potential for
dangerous driving conditions. Icy roads are also possible on
untreated roads. If you are traveling and encounter adverse winter
driving conditions, reduce speed and make sure headlights are on.</description>
