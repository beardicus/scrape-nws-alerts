<description>...Dangerous Snow Squalls Likely Tonight...
Snow squalls embedded in a line of heavy precipitation will move
eastward into northern and western New Hampshire between 9PM and
Midnight, and into northwestern Maine from 10 PM through 2AM.
Expect rapidly changing conditions with heavy snowfall rates and
wind gusts up to 35 mph causing very low visibilities and snow-
covered roads, especially through the higher terrain. At lower
elevations, precipitation may initially start as rain before
changing to snow. As the snow comes to an end, temperatures
quickly fall below freezing, causing any remaining water or slush
on any untreated surfaces to refreeze and become slick overnight.
Precautionary/Preparedness Actions...
Be prepared for areas of blowing and drifting snow. This could
lead to temporary whiteout conditions and the potential for
dangerous driving conditions. Untreated surfaces will become
slippery once covered with snow, and remain hazardous through the
overnight hours. If you are traveling and encounter adverse
winter driving conditions, reduce speed and use extra caution in
rapidly changing conditions.</description>
