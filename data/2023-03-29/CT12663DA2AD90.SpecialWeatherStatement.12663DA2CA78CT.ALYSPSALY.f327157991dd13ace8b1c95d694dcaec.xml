<description>...SNOW SHOWERS WITH EMBEDDED SNOW SQUALLS WILL AFFECT PORTIONS OF
DUTCHESS...COLUMBIA...BERKSHIRE AND LITCHFIELD COUNTIES...
At 1152 PM EDT, A line of snow showers with embedded snow squalls
accompanied by winds of up to 45 MPH, which can rapidly reduce
visibility to less than a quarter of a mile. Precipitation will
begin as rain in lower elevations before quickly changing to snow.
Movement was southeast at 40 mph.
Locations impacted include...
Waterbury, Pittsfield, Torrington, New Milford, Great Barrington,
Sherman, Pawling, Brookfield, Canton, Thomaston, Middlebury, New
Hartford, Lee, Lenox, Amenia, Copake, Sheffield, Kent, Sharon and New
Lebanon.
Visibilities are below one quarter of a mile in this area of snow
showers with embedded snow squalls. If you are driving, slow down
and be on alert for other motorists. Low visibility shortens the
amount of time you have to react to situations.
A rapid drop in temperatures will lead to the rapid formation of
black ice on area roadways. Black ice is nearly impossible to see and
roadways may appear wet. Please use extreme caution, especially on
bridges, overpasses and around curves. Allow plenty of stopping
distance and avoid braking suddenly.
Conditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be
prepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra
time when traveling.</description>
