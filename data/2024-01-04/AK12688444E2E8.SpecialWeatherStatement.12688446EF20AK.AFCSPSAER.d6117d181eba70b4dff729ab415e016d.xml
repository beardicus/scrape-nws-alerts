<description>...PERIODS OF MODERATE TO HEAVY SNOW SHOWERS ALONG THE SEWARD
HIGHWAY CORRIDOR THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH FRIDAY EVENING...
Bands of moderate to heavy snow showers will develop over the
eastern Kenai Peninsula this afternoon and continue into Friday
before slowly tapering off Friday evening. The heaviest of the
shower activity will likely be late this afternoon through early
Friday morning. During this time, snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches
per hour are possible in heavier snow showers. Expect
significantly reduced visibility in heavier snow showers.
Motorists travelling the Seward Highway south of Portage are urged
to slow down and use caution when encountering these heavier snow
showers.
Snow accumulations of 6 inches or more are possible through
Turnagain Pass and from Moose Pass to Bear Creek. Lesser snow
amounts are expected for Seward and around Portage and Whittier
as temperatures remaining in the mid 30s will allow rain to mix
in at times.</description>
