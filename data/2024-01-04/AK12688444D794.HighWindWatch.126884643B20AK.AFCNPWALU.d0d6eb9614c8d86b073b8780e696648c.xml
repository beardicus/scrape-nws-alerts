<headline>High Wind Watch issued January 04 at 3:29PM AKST until January 06 at 9:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...HIGH WIND WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY MORNING THROUGH
SATURDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...West winds 50 to 70 mph with gusts up to 90 mph
possible.
* WHERE...Central Aleutians, including Adak and Atka.
* WHEN...From Saturday morning through Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...High winds could move loose debris, damage property,
and cause power outages. Travel could be difficult.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A rapidly intensifying storm system will
track from the North Pacific into the southern Bering Sea Friday
night through Saturday. There is good potential for high winds
across the central Aleutian Islands. However, any change in the
track or speed of the storm could shift the core of strongest
winds away from Adak and Atka. Precipitation will fall mainly as
rain Friday night, but could transition back to a wet snow
Saturday in Adak. Thus, there could be reduced visibilities as
the high winds blow the falling snow.</description>
<instruction>A high wind watch means there is potential for a hazardous high
wind event. Monitor the latest forecasts and warnings for updates
on this situation. Fasten loose objects or shelter objects in a
safe location prior to the onset of winds.</instruction>
