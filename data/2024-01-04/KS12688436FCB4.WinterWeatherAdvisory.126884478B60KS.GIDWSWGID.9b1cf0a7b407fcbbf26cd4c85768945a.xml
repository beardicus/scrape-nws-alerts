<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 04 at 3:49AM CST until January 05 at 12:00PM CST by NWS Hastings</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM THIS MORNING TO NOON
CST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Light Freezing drizzle will be possible this morning and
into the afternoon hours. Wet snow expected tonight. Total snow
accumulations up to one inch.
* WHERE...Portions of north central Kansas and south central
Nebraska.
* WHEN...From 9 AM this morning to noon CST Friday.
* IMPACTS...Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will
likely become slick and hazardous later this morning as a light
glaze from freezing drizzle accumulates. Plan on slippery road
conditions. The hazardous conditions should subside some by late
afternoon before light snow begins across the area this evening.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...While overall snowfall accumulations will
likely be less than one inch through the period, the combination
of freezing drizzle ahead of the snow could make for hazardous
road conditions.</description>
<instruction>Slow down and use caution while traveling. The latest road
conditions for the state you are calling from can be obtained by
calling 5 1 1.
Be prepared for slippery roads. Slow down and use caution while
driving. If you are going outside, watch your first few steps taken
on stairs, sidewalks, and driveways. These surfaces could be icy and
slippery, increasing your risk of a fall and injury.</instruction>
