<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued January 04 at 3:33PM AKST until January 06 at 9:00PM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY MORNING THROUGH
SATURDAY EVENING ALONG THE KUSKOKWIM DELTA COAST AND NUNIVAK
ISLAND...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions possible. Total snow accumulations of
up to 4 inches possible. East winds gusting 45 to 60 mph.
* WHERE...Kuskokwim Delta coast and Nunivak Island.
* WHEN...From Saturday morning through Saturday evening.
* IMPACTS...Plan on difficult travel conditions. Widespread
blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A strong front will bring strong gusty
winds and snow to the Kuskokwim delta coast and Nunivak Island.
Warmer air will also accompany this front and there is
uncertainty in how fast temperatures will warm and whether it
will warm enough for snow to mix with or change to rain. In
either case, it looks favorable for snow and blowing snow as
precipitation first arrives Saturday morning.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Watch for blizzard conditions means there is a
potential for falling and/or blowing snow with strong winds and
extremely poor visibilities. This can lead to whiteout conditions
and make travel very hazardous.</instruction>
