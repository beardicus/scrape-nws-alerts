<headline>Special Weather Statement issued August 07 at 6:32PM MDT  by NWS Riverton</headline>
<description>...A strong thunderstorm will impact portions of north central
Fremont County through 700 PM MDT...
At 630 PM MDT, Doppler radar was tracking a strong thunderstorm 7
miles northwest of Boysen State Park, which is also 13 miles
northwest of Shoshoni, moving east at 25 mph.
HAZARD...Winds in excess of 30 mph and penny size hail.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around
unsecured objects. Minor damage to outdoor objects is
possible.
Locations impacted include...
Boysen Reservoir and Shoshoni.
MAX HAIL SIZE...0.75 IN
MAX WIND GUST...30 MPH</description>
<instruction>If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.
Conditions are favorable for the development of weak, brief funnel
clouds. This type of funnel cloud is harmless, but on rare occasions
they can briefly touch down, producing wind gusts over 50 mph. If a
funnel cloud is spotted move indoors and report your sighting to the
National Weather Service.
Very heavy rainfall is also occurring with this storm and may lead
to localized flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flooded
roadways.
Frequent cloud to ground lightning is occurring with this storm.
Lightning can strike 10 miles away from a thunderstorm. Seek a safe
shelter inside a building or vehicle.
If on or near Bass Lake or Boysen Reservoir, get out of the water
and move indoors or inside a vehicle. Remember, lightning can strike
out to 10 miles from the parent thunderstorm. If you can hear
thunder, you are close enough to be struck by lightning. Move to
safe shelter now! Do not be caught on the water in a thunderstorm.
Persons in campgrounds should consider seeking sturdy shelter until
this storm passes.</instruction>
