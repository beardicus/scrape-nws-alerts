<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 07 at 4:11PM EDT until August 07 at 7:00PM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 PM EDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Nuisance to Minor flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
expected.
* WHERE...A portion of western North Carolina, including the
following counties, Madison, Mitchell and Yancey.
* WHEN...Until 1000 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Nuisance flooding of low-lying areas adjacent to streams
and other poor-drainage areas, including farmland, parks, greenways,
boat-access areas, and golf courses.  Isolated, shallow flows over
roadways is possible.  A few flood-prone, low-water crossings may
become impassible.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 401 PM EDT, Doppler radar and rain gauges indicated heavy
rain due to thunderstorms is ending over the Big Laurel
Creek, Shelton Laurel Creek, and lower Cane River/Nolichucky
watersheds in northern Madison, Yancey, and Mitchell
counties.  However, over the past 60-90 minutes, 1.5 to 2.5
inches of rain have fallen, which is generating excessive
runoff.  Rapid small stream rises are imminent or occurring,
which may result in isolated areas of nuisance to Minor
flooding over low-lying areas adjacent to these small
streams.
Areas of greatest concern are along the lower Cane River and
associated tributaries near Hunting Dale Rd and Will Higgins
Rd, Lickskillet Branch near Lickskillet Rd, and Big Laurel
Creek and associated tributaries near Big Laurel Rd.
- An additional 0.50-1.00 inch of rainfall is possible over the
next 60-90 minutes as light to moderate rain persists behind
the departing thunderstorms.  This may prolong stream rises
and the flood threat for the next few hours.  No additional
heavy rainfall is expected and more significant flooding is
not expected to develop.
- Some locations that may experience flooding include...
Burnsville, Hot Springs, Wolf Ridge, Faust, Swiss,
Ramseytown, Poplar, Allenstand, Walnut, and Green Mountain.

<instruction>In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
