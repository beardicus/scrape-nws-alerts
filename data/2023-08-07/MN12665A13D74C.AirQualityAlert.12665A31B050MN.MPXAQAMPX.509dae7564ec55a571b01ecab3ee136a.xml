<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT FROM NOON CDT TUESDAY TO NOON CDT
WEDNESDAY...
* WHAT...The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has issued an Air Quality
Alert for fine particles pollution. The Air Quality Index (AQI)
is expected to reach the Orange or Unhealthy for Sensitive
Groups category.
* WHERE...Central Minnesota.
* WHEN...From noon CDT Tuesday to noon CDT Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including
asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults, may
experience health effects.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Heavy ground-level smoke from wildfires in
northern Canada is currently impacting central North Dakota.
Light westerly winds over the region will cause the smoke to
drift towards the Minn. border. Smoke is expected to reach
northwest Minn. by 6 a.m. Tuesday and northeast Minn. by 3 p.m
Tuesday. Northerly winds will push this smoke south early
Wednesday. The smoke will impact north central MN on Wednesday,
but air quality will begin to improve from north to south
Wednesday afternoon.

<instruction>Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including
asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults, should
limit prolonged or heavy exertion.
Reduce or eliminate activities that contribute to air pollution,
such as outdoor burning, and use of residential wood burning
devices. Reduce vehicle trips and vehicle idling as much as
possible.
Keep windows closed overnight to prevent smoke from getting
indoors.</instruction>
