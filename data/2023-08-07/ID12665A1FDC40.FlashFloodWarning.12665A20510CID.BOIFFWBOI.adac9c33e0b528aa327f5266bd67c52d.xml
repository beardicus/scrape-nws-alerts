<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued August 07 at 6:16PM MDT until August 07 at 9:15PM MDT by NWS Boise</headline>
<description>The National Weather Service in Boise has issued a
* Flash Flood Warning for...
North Central Ada County in southwestern Idaho...
Southwestern Boise County in southwestern Idaho...
* Until 915 PM MDT.
* At 616 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing
heavy rain across the warned area. The expected rainfall rate is 1
to 3 inches in 1 hour. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to
begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar may result in debris flow
moving through the Boise Foothills. The debris flow can consist of
rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban
areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as
other poor drainage and low-lying areas.
* Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Northern Boise and Hidden Springs.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
EXPECTED RAINFALL RATE...1-3 INCHES IN 1 HOUR</description>
<instruction>This is a life threatening situation. Heavy rainfall will cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks...streams...and
ditches in the Burn Scar. Severe debris flows can also be
anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may be washed away in
places. If you encounter flood waters...climb to safety.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry washes is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Move to higher ground now. Act quickly to protect your life.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. It is important to know where
you are relative to streams, rivers, or creeks which can become
killers in heavy rains. Campers and hikers should avoid streams or
creeks.</instruction>
