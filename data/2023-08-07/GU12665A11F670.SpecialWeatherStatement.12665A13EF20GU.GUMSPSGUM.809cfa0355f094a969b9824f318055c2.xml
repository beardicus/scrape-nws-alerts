<description>...HEAVY RAIN AND GUSTY WINDS POSSIBLE LATE WEDNESDAY INTO THE
WEEKEND...
A tropical system, known as Invest 94W, continues to be monitored
by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and your National
Weather Service Forecast Office in Guam.
At this time, it looks like 94W, currently located near 11N142E,
will remain weak and poorly organized as it gradually gets
absorbed into a larger system to the north-northeast of the CNMI.
Still, a fairly strong monsoonal flow will develop for the late
Wednesday into the weekend time frame. This pattern will bring
increasing showers and thunderstorms into the region. Locally
heavy rainfall and gust winds are likely during this time.
For more information, please see the following web page:
weather.gov/gum/
Time: Late Wednesday into the weekend
Location: Guam and the CNMI.
Rainfall: 4 to 8 inches with locally higher amounts possible.
Winds: South to southwesterly sustained winds of 15 to 20 mph,
with gusts to 40 mph with any stronger shower or thunderstorm
that develops.</description>
