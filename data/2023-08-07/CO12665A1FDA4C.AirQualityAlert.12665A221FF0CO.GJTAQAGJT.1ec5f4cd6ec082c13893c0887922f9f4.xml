<description>...AIR QUALITY HEALTH ADVISORY FOR WILDFIRE SMOKE FROM 600 PM
MONDAY UNTIL 900 AM TUESDAY...
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has
issued the following...
WHAT...Air Quality Health Advisory for Wildfire Smoke.
WHERE...Archuleta and southern Hinsdale Counties. Locations
include, but are not limited to Piedra and Arboles.
WHEN...600 PM Monday August 07 to 900 AM Tuesday August 08
IMPACTS...The Bear Creek and Dry Lake wildfires will impact
southern Hinsdale and western Archuleta counties through at least
early Tuesday morning. Moderate to heavy smoke from these fires
will drain from Weminuche Creek in southern Hinsdale County
southward overnight into the Piedra area, and could continue down
the Piedra River as far south as Arboles by early Tuesday morning.
Additionally, the Quartz Ridge wildfire in eastern Archuleta
County could produce moderate to heavy smoke for locations along
East Fork Road westward to Highway 160 north of Pagosa Springs.
HEALTH INFORMATION...Public Health Recommendations: If smoke is
thick or becomes thick in your neighborhood you may want to remain
indoors. This is especially true for those with heart disease,
respiratory illnesses, the very young, and the elderly. Consider
limiting outdoor activity when moderate to heavy smoke is present.
Consider relocating temporarily if smoke is present indoors and is
making you ill. If visibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in
your neighborhood, smoke has reached levels that are unhealthy.</description>
