<instruction>Do not drive into flooded areas or go around barricades. Nearly two
feet of water will carry most vehicles away. Turn around, don`t
drown.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. Most flood related deaths
occur in automobiles. Do not attempt to cross water covered bridges,
dips, or low water crossings. Never try to cross a flowing stream,
even a small one, on foot. To escape rising water find another route
over higher ground.
