<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM AKDT THURSDAY...
* WHAT...Flooding of low lying areas
* WHERE...The Innoko River at Shageluk
* WHEN...Until 1000 AM AKDT Thursday.
* IMPACTS...Flooding continues in low-lying areas along the Innoko
River at Shageluk. Residents report water over some roads near the
river, including the road to the airport which is impassable.
Water levels have started to gradually recede in Shageluk since
cresting on Tuesday and are expected to fall during the remainder
of the week.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1200 PM AKDT, An ice jam that was on the Yukon River last
week caused a significant amount of water to flow overland
and into the Innoko River. This surge of water is currently
moving down the Innoko River and resulting in extensive
overbank flow and flooding. This surge of water will
gradually move downriver into the weekend with water levels
falling as the crest passes.
