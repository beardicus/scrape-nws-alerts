<description>...Expect Increased Flows on the Green River Below Flaming Gorge
Reservoir Due to Releases...
Releases from Flaming Gorge Reservoir have started to increase today
May 24 and will reach to around 8600 cfs by the morning of May 26.
The 8600 cfs release is scheduled to last for 7 days before starting
to ramp down.
Anyone planning to recreate on area waterways should maintain
awareness and use an abundance of caution in or near the water. The
water will be much colder, run high and shift.
Additionally, the Yampa River will increase later this week and
increase flows especially below the confluence with the Green River.
River levels near Jensen, UT are forecast to be near bankfull by
early next week.
Agriculture should take appropriate action to move or secure
equipment near the river.
Weather and reservoir release adjustments can change the flows on
the Green River. Please monitor river conditions if your are
recreating on, working near or traveling to the Green River below
Flaming Gorge Reservoir.</description>
