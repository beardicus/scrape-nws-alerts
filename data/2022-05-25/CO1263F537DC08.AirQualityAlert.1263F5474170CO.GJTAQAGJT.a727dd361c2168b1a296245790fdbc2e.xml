<description>...AIR QUALITY HEALTH ADVISORY FOR WILDFIRE SMOKE FROM 800 AM
WEDNESDAY UNTIL 900 AM THURSDAY...
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has
issued the following...
WHAT...Air Quality Health Advisory for Wildfire Smoke.
WHERE...La Plata County. Locations include, but are not limited to
Durango.
WHEN...800 AM Wednesday May 25 to 900 AM Thursday May 26
IMPACTS...Moderate to heavy smoke from the Perins Peak wildfire
can be expected in Durango early Wednesday morning. Air quality
will gradually improve by late Wednesday morning as atmospheric
mixing increases and smoke lifts into the atmosphere. By Wednesday
afternoon, some smoke impacts will be possible downwind of the
fire in central and southern La Plata County, possibly impacting
Oxford and parts of the Southern Ute Reservation. However, any
smoke impacts in that area should be fairly brief. By late
Wednesday evening, smoke will begin to drain to lower elevations
bringing heavy smoke again to Durango through early Thursday
morning.
HEALTH INFORMATION...Public Health Recommendations: If smoke is
thick or becomes thick in your neighborhood you may want to remain
indoors. This is especially true for those with heart disease,
respiratory illnesses, the very young, and the elderly. Consider
limiting outdoor activity when moderate to heavy smoke is present.
Consider relocating temporarily if smoke is present indoors and is
making you ill. If visibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in
your neighborhood, smoke has reached levels that are unhealthy.</description>
