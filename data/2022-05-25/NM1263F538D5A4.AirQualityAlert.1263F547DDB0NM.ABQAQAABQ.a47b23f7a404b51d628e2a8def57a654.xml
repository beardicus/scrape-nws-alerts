<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT...
The following message is transmitted at the request of the New Mexico
Departments of Health and Environment, United States Forest Service
and the Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality Response Program.
* WHAT...Smoke from the Black and Bear Trap fires in southwest New
Mexico will once again be pushed toward the south and southeast
through the rest of today into the evening hours. Significant smoke
impacts will continue to be focused in the immediate vicinity of
these fires, as well as to the south-southeast beneath lighter
northwest transport winds. Warmer and drier conditions over north-
central New Mexico will likely result in increased smoke from the
Hermits Peak/Calf Canyon fires as compared to the past two days.
However, widespread significant impacts are not expected.
* WHERE...Of particular concern will be locations and communities in
the immediate vicinity of and areas south and southeast of the Black
and Bear Trap fires. This includes the Lower Rio Grande Valley
corridor to include Hatch, Radium Springs and Las Cruces in Sierra
and northern Dona Ana counties where air quality may become
unhealthy at times for sensitive groups. Elsewhere, significant
impacts from smoke are expected to persist across much of Catron,
western Socorro, northern Grant, northern Luna and western Sierra
counties. More details on impacted locations and latest air quality
information can be found at https://fire.airnow.gov.
* WHEN...Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1 pm MDT
Thursday, May 26.
* IMPACTS...Those with conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and heart
disease will be especially vulnerable to impacts from poor air
quality, as will adults over age 65, young children, and pregnant
women if smoke concentrations become unhealthy.
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method
available at
https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/IndoorQuality.html and
https://cv.nmhealth.org
New Mexicans will also need to take steps to keep their homes cool to
avoid heat-related illnesses. NMDOH offers tips here:
