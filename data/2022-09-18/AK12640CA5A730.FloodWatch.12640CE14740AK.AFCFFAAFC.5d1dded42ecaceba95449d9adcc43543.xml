<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH LATE
WEDNESDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...Southeast Prince William Sound, including Cordova.
* WHEN...From late Monday night through late Wednesday night.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- There is good potential for periods of heavy rain Monday
through Wednesday. There is some uncertainty in the exact
timing and placement of heaviest rain. At this point in time,
it looks like the heaviest rain for the Cordova area will be
Tuesday night through Wednesday. Storm total rainfall Monday
through Wednesday night of 4 to 9 inches is possible. While
rainfall totals look like they will be less than during the
recent flood event September 7th to 9th, they might end up
only marginally lower for this coming storm. Thus, there is
potential for similar impacts.
Flooding is possible along Eyak Lake, including Power Creek
Road. Flooding is also possible along areas rivers and
streams.
