* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Hurricane Warning is in effect for all of Puerto Rico,
including Vieques and Culebra.
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for the U.S. Virgin
Islands.

SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Fiona is currently centered just west of Cabo Rojo, Puerto
Rico, with the rain bands covering all of Puerto Rico, including
Vieques and Culebra and also the U.S. Virgin Islands. Torrential
rainfall continues to affect the territory, creating catastrophic flash
flood conditions, rivers overflowing and mudslides. Wind damage is
also being reported, especially along western, southern and the
interior of Puerto Rico. A Hurricane Warning is in effect for Puerto
Rico, as well as for the local waters. For the U.S. Virgin Islands, a
Tropical Storm Warning remains in effect. Maximum sustained winds are
expected to be as high as 85 mph, with higher gusts up to 105 mph over
Puerto Rico, especially for southwestern and western Puerto Rico. The
winds and the rain is expected to linger into Monday, as Fiona moves
across the Mona Channel.
Deteriorated, hazardous marine and coastal conditions are also
anticipated. Seas will build to around 18 feet, lasting through
tomorrow. Winds over the seas will be around 75 knots with gusts to
90 knots. For the southern and southeastern coasts, water levels of
1 to 3 feet above ground level are expected, which could cause minor
coastal flooding and beach erosion.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
the region. Remain well guarded against life-threatening flood waters
having possible devastating impacts. If realized, these impacts
include:
- Extreme rainfall flooding may prompt numerous evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may overwhelmingly overflow their banks
in many places with deep moving water. Small streams, creeks,
canals, arroyos, and ditches may become raging rivers. In
mountain areas, deadly runoff may rage down valleys while
increasing susceptibility to rockslides and mudslides. Flood
control systems and barriers may become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter numerous structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Numerous places where flood waters may cover escape
routes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of raging water
with underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become very
dangerous. Numerous road and bridge closures with some weakened
or washed out.
Protect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
significant to extensive impacts across the entire area.
* WIND:
Protect against life-threatening wind having extensive impacts across
Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Potential impacts include:
- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some having
window, door, and garage door failures leading to structural
damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed.
Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Locations may be
uninhabitable for weeks.
- Many large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and
roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. Several bridges, causeways, and
access routes impassable.
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across
southern and southeastern Puerto Rico. Remain well away from locally
hazardous surge having limited impacts. If realized, these impacts
include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread
with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where
surge water covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts
across Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Potential impacts
include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Do not return to evacuated areas until hazardous winds diminish and
flood waters abate.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to remain safely sheltered from the storm. Stay inside
and away from windows. Listen for updates and be ready in case you
lose electrical power. Locate your battery powered radio and flashlight
from your Emergency Supplies Kit. Keep these items close.
During the peak of the storm, keep your shoes on and rain gear handy.
Boots and tennis shoes offer the best foot protection if you become
unexpectedly exposed to the elements.
Continue to keep your cell phone well charged for as long as
possible. If you lose power, use it more sparingly and mainly for
personal emergencies and check-ins. Do not overload communications
systems with idle chatter.
Do not venture outside while in the eye of a hurricane. Within the
eye, weather conditions may temporarily improve which can be
misleading. Once the eye passes, the wind will change direction and
return to dangerous speeds. Heavy rain will also return. Be smart and
remain safely hidden from the storm.
Do not be a thrill seeker or risk your life for senseless photos or
videos. Be wise and avoid becoming another statistic.
Be ready to move to the identified safe room if your home or shelter
begins to fail. Quickly move to an interior room on the lowest floor.
Put as many sturdy walls between you and the storm as you can.
Protect your head and body.
