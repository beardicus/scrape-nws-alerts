<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM MONDAY MORNING
THROUGH MONDAY EVENING...
* WHAT...Moderate risk of sneaker waves expected. These are
waves that have an unusually higher run up on beaches when
compared to other observed waves.
* WHERE...Beaches along the Southern Oregon Coast, including the
beaches of Douglas, Coos, and Curry counties.
* WHEN...From Monday morning through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...Even during calm conditions, sneaker waves can sweep
up the beach without warning and knock unsuspecting people
over and pull them out to sea. Shock and hypothermia can occur
quickly in the cold Pacific waters. In addition, logs and
other debris can be lifted and carried by the waves, crushing
or entrapping unsuspecting victims underneath.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Building northwest swells at 9 seconds
and 18 seconds are expected on Monday.
