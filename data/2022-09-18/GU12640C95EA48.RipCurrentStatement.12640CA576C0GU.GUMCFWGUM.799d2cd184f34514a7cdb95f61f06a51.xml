<headline>Rip Current Statement issued September 18 at 4:10AM ChST until September 19 at 6:00AM ChST by NWS Guam</headline>
<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 AM CHST MONDAY...
...HIGH RISK OF RIP CURRENTS THROUGH 6 AM CHST MONDAY...
* WHAT...For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking waves of 8
to 11 feet in the surf zone. For the High Rip Current Risk,
dangerous rip currents.
* WHERE...North and west facing reefs of the Marianas.
* WHEN...Until 6 AM Monday.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and
localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best
swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Northwest swell will briefly weaken Monday,
dropping surf below hazardous criteria through Monday night. There
is a possibility of surf becoming hazardous once again along north
and west facing reefs starting Tuesday, as another northwest swell
strengthens due to a nearby tropical disturbance.</description>
<instruction>Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.
Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and
float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a
direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the
shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
