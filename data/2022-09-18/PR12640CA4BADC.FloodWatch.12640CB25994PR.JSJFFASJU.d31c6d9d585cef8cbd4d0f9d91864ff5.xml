* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rain from Hurricane Fiona continues to affect the islands.
The main area of rainfall associated with the storm continues
to affect all local islands. Periods of moderate to heavy
rainfall are expected, both as the system moves through the
region, as well as in the enhanced moisture that will persist
over the area for several days. Life-threatening to
catastrophic flooding is expected.
The heaviest rainfall is expected for today through Monday.
Rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches are expected for much of
the region, including the U.S. Virgin Islands, with locally
higher amounts. In southern Puerto Rico, however, rainfall
amounts of 12 to 16 inches are anticipated, and locally
higher amounts to around 20 to 25 inches are possible.
