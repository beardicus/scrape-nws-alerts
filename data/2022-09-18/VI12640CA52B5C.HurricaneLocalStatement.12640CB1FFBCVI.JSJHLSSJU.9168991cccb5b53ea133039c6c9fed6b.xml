**EYE OF FIONA VERY NEAR THE SOUTHWEST COAST OF PUERTO RICO**
NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Hurricane Warning is in effect for all of Puerto Rico,
including Vieques and Culebra.
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for the United States
Virgin Islands.
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 40 miles south-southeast of Mayaguez PR or about 140
miles west of Saint Croix VI
- 17.8N 66.9W
- Storm Intensity 85 mph
- Movement West-northwest or 285 degrees at 8 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Hurricane Fiona is currently located 25 miles southwest of Ponce, at
17.8 North, 66.9 West. The forecast continues to show Fiona in the
vicinity of Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico late this afternoon or early this
evening, as it continues to strengthen. Therefore, a Hurricane Warning
is in effect for Puerto Rico, as well as for the local waters.
Hurricane conditions are likely for portions of Puerto Rico as well as
for the local waters. For the U.S. Virgin Islands, a Tropical Storm
Warning remains in effect. Maximum sustained winds are expected to be
as high as near 85 mph, with higher gusts over Puerto Rico, especially
for southwestern and western Puerto Rico.
The main hazard remains the flooding rainfall that this storm will
bring. Periods of moderate to heavy rainfall have been seen this
morning and early in the afternoon, especially for St. Croix and
eastern, southeastern, south and the interior of Puerto Rico. Rainfall
totals in southern Puerto Rico are forecast to be 12 to 16 inches, and
locally up to 20 to 25 inches. Elsewhere, rainfall amounts of 5 to 10
inches are expected, with locally higher amounts. This amount of
rainfall will result in life-threatening flash and urban flooding, as
well as mudslides or rockfalls and river flooding. The greatest threat
for these dangerous flooding conditions is expected between tonight and
Monday.
Deteriorated, hazardous marine and coastal conditions are also
anticipated. Seas will build to around 18 feet, lasting through the
weekend. Winds over the seas will be around 65 knots with gusts to
80 knots. For the southern and southeastern coasts, water levels of
1 to 3 feet above ground level are expected.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across
the region. Remain well guarded against life-threatening flood waters
having possible devastating impacts. If realized, these impacts
include:
- Extreme rainfall flooding may prompt numerous evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may overwhelmingly overflow their banks
in many places with deep moving water. Small streams, creeks,
canals, arroyos, and ditches may become raging rivers. In
mountain areas, deadly runoff may rage down valleys while
increasing susceptibility to rockslides and mudslides. Flood
control systems and barriers may become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter numerous structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed
away. Numerous places where flood waters may cover escape
routes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of raging water
with underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become very
dangerous. Numerous road and bridge closures with some weakened
or washed out.
Protect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible
significant to extensive impacts across the entire area.
* WIND:
Protect against life-threatening wind having extensive impacts across
Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Potential impacts include:
- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some having
window, door, and garage door failures leading to structural
damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed.
Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Locations may be
uninhabitable for weeks.
- Many large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and
roadway signs blown over.
- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban
or heavily wooded places. Several bridges, causeways, and
access routes impassable.
* SURGE:
Potential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across
southern and southeastern Puerto Rico. Remain well away from locally
hazardous surge having limited impacts. If realized, these impacts
include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread
with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where
surge water covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.
- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,
and piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.
* TORNADOES:
Protect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts
across Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Potential impacts
include:
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution
of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power
and communications disruptions.
- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys
toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,
large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats
pulled from moorings.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* EVACUATIONS:
Do not return to evacuated areas until hazardous winds diminish and
flood waters abate.
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to remain safely sheltered from the storm. Stay inside
and away from windows. Listen for updates and be ready in case you
lose electrical power. Locate your battery powered radio and flashlight
from your Emergency Supplies Kit. Keep these items close.
During the peak of the storm, keep your shoes on and rain gear handy.
Boots and tennis shoes offer the best foot protection if you become
unexpectedly exposed to the elements.
Continue to keep your cell phone well charged for as long as
possible. If you lose power, use it more sparingly and mainly for
personal emergencies and check-ins. Do not overload communications
systems with idle chatter.
Do not venture outside while in the eye of a hurricane. Within the
eye, weather conditions may temporarily improve which can be
misleading. Once the eye passes, the wind will change direction and
return to dangerous speeds. Heavy rain will also return. Be smart and
remain safely hidden from the storm.
Do not be a thrill seeker or risk your life for senseless photos or
videos. Be wise and avoid becoming another statistic.
Be ready to move to the identified safe room if your home or shelter
begins to fail. Quickly move to an interior room on the lowest floor.
Put as many sturdy walls between you and the storm as you can.
Protect your head and body.
