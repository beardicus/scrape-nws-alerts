<headline>Flood Warning issued August 20 at 2:41PM CDT until August 22 at 5:30AM CDT by NWS Midland-Odessa</headline>
<description>...The National Weather Service in Midland/Odessa TX has issued a
Flood Warning for the following rivers in Texas...
Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch affecting Brewster County.
.Thunderstorms have produced very heavy rainfall over the past few
days in Mexico over the Rio Conchos basin.  As a result, very high
flows are coming out of the Rio Conchos into the Rio Grande at
Presidio.  The flood wave is expected to crest at Presidio today,
and move downstream through Big Bend National Park Sunday.
Additional rainfall over the next few days could prolong the
flooding.
For the Rio Grande...including Presidio International Bridge,
Presidio 5SE, Castolon, Johnson Ranch, Boquillas...Minor flooding is
forecast.
...FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FROM LATE TONIGHT TO EARLY MONDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Minor flooding is forecast.
* WHERE...Rio Grande at Johnson Ranch.
* WHEN...From late tonight to early Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...At 12.0 feet (3.7 meters), the river reaches bankfull,
minor lowland flooding occurs, and no significant damage is
expected.
At 15.0 feet (4.6 meters), flood stage is reached.  Moderate
lowland flooding begins.  Roads that lead to Cottonwood Campground
and River Road may flood.  Stages are practically synonymous with
the gage at Cottonwood Campground at Castolon (CSTT2), and
therefore represent the reach from Santa Elena Canyon through
Cottonwood Campground, where damage may occur.  Cattle also graze
in the lowlands, and may be threatened.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 2:15 PM CDT Saturday the stage was 9.7 feet (3.0 meters).
- Forecast...The river is expected to rise above flood stage
late tonight to a crest of 16.6 feet (5.1 meters) early
tomorrow afternoon. It will then fall below flood stage
tomorrow afternoon.
- Flood stage is 15.0 feet (4.6 meters).
- Flood History...No available flood history.

<instruction>Motorists should not attempt to drive around barricades or drive
cars through flooded areas.
Flooding is occurring or is imminent. Most flood related deaths
occur in automobiles. Do not attempt to cross water covered bridges,
dips, or low water crossings. Never try to cross a flowing stream,
even a small one, on foot. To escape rising water find another route
over higher ground.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.
Additional information is available at www.weather.gov.
The next statement will be issued late tonight at 245 AM CDT.</instruction>
