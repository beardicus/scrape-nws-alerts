<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 20 at 5:50PM MDT until August 20 at 7:00PM MDT by NWS GrandJunction</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 845 PM MDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Arroyo and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...Portions of northwest Colorado and northeast Utah,
including  Rio Blanco County in northwest Colorado and Uintah
County in northeast Utah. The areas that will experience flooding
include mainly rural areas of West Central Rio Blanco and East
Central Uintah Counties 10 to 20 miles southwest of Rangely.
* WHEN...Until 845 PM MDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
Rises in small streams and normally dry arroyos. Some low-water
crossings may become impassable.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 541 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms. This will cause arroyo and small stream
flooding. Between 0.8 and 1.1 inches of rain have fallen.
- This includes the following streams and drainages...
Asphalt Wash, Evacuation Creek, West Fork Asphalt Wash,
Shavetail Wash, Center Fork Asphalt Wash, Cottonwood Creek
and Big Horse Draw.
Additional rainfall amounts of 0.3 to 0.7 inches are expected
over the area in Colorado. This additional rain will result
in minor flooding.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Remain alert for flooding even in locations not receiving rain.
Arroyos, streams, and rivers can become raging killer currents in a
matter of minutes, even from distant rainfall.</instruction>
