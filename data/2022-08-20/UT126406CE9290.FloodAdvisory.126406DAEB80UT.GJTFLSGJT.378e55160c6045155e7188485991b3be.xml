<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 20 at 5:08PM MDT until August 20 at 10:00PM MDT by NWS GrandJunction</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM MDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Arroyo and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of northeast Utah, including mainly rural areas
of South Central Uintah County approximately 50 miles south of
Vernal and 50 miles northeast of Green River.
* WHEN...Until 800 PM MDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
Rises in small streams and normally dry arroyos. Dangerous flows
over low-water crossings. Some low-water crossings may become
impassable.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 501 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms. This will cause arroyo and small stream
flooding. Between 1 and 1.4 inches of rain have fallen.
- This includes the following streams and drainages...
Cottonwood Wash, Hill Creek, Willow Creek and Main Canyon.
Additional rainfall amounts of 0.5 to 1 inch are expected
over the area. This additional rain will result in minor
flooding.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Remain alert for flooding even in locations not receiving rain.
Arroyos, streams, and rivers can become raging killer currents in a
matter of minutes, even from distant rainfall.</instruction>
