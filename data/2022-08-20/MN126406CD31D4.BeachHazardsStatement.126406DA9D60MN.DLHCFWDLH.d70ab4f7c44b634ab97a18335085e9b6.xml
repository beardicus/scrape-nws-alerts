<headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued August 20 at 9:05AM CDT until August 20 at 9:00PM CDT by NWS Duluth</headline>
<description>...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 PM CDT THIS
EVENING...
* WHAT...Dangerous swimming conditions are expected along the
Lake Superior shoreline due to high wave action and strong rip
currents.
* WHERE...Minnesota Park Point and Wisconsin Point Beaches.
* WHEN...Until 9 PM CDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...High wave action can make swimming difficult on days
such as this. Incoming waves in rapid succession can tire a
swimmer quickly.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Although northeast winds are expected to
weaken this afternoon, waves should linger between 2 to 3 feet
into the early evening hours, continuing the hazardous swimming
conditions.</description>
<instruction>Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
near shoreline structures such as peninsulas or breakwalls...and
near river mouths.
