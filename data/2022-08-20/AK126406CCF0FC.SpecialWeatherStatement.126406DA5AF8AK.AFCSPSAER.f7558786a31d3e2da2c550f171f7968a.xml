<description>...PERIODS OF RAINFALL WILL CONTINUE ACROSS ANCHORAGE THROUGH
TONIGHT...
An additional 0.20&quot; to &quot;0.30&quot; is expected for the Anchorage Bowl
Saturday morning through Saturday night. This is due to the
persistent moist, southwest flow aloft around an upper level low.
Rainfall should taper off by Sunday morning with just a few
lingering showers around for Sunday.
The additional rain today could push small streams and creeks to,
or slightly above, bankfull. Smaller rivers could see water
levels rise to bankfull; however, water levels along larger rivers
are expected to remain below bankfull.
In urban areas, ponding of water and localized flooding on poorly
drained roadways is also possible. Please use caution when
driving or when recreating along or on area waterways.
