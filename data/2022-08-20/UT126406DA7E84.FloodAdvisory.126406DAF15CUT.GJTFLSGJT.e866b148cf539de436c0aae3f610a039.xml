<headline>Flood Advisory issued August 20 at 7:21PM MDT until August 20 at 10:15PM MDT by NWS GrandJunction</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 1030 PM MDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Arroyo and small stream flooding caused by excessive
rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of east central Utah, including Grand County
near Cisco.
* WHEN...Until 1030 PM MDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
Dangerous flows over low-water crossings. Water over roadways.
Some low-water crossings may become impassable.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 718 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms. This will cause arroyo and small stream
flooding. Between 1 and 1.3 inches of rain have fallen.
- This includes the following streams and drainages...
Cisco Wash, Nash Wash and Sagers Wash.
Additional rainfall amounts of 0.3 to 0.7 inches are expected
over the area. This additional rain will result in minor
flooding.</description>
<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Remain alert for flooding even in locations not receiving rain.
Arroyos, streams, and rivers can become raging killer currents in a
matter of minutes, even from distant rainfall.</instruction>
