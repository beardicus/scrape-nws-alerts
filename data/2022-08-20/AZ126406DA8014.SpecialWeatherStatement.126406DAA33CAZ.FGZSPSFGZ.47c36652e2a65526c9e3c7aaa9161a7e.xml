the south-southeast.
HAZARD...Wind gusts up to 50 mph, up to half inch hail, and heavy
rainfall.

unsecured objects. Minor damage to outdoor objects is
possible. Heavy rainfall will reduce visibility.

Congress, Walnut Grove, Wagoner, Yarnell, Peeples Valley, Wilhoit and
Glen Ilah.
This includes the following highways...
State Route 89 between mile markers 258 and 293, and between mile

<instruction>If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.

roadways. Heavy rainfall will create hazardous driving conditions,
due to reduced visibility and slick roads.</instruction>
