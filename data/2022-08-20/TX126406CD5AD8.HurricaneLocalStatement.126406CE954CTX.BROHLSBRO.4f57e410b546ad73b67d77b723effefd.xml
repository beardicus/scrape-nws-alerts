NEW INFORMATION
---------------
* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- None
* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Cameron Island,
Coastal Cameron, Coastal Willacy, Inland Cameron, Inland
Willacy, Southern Hidalgo, and Willacy Island
* STORM INFORMATION:
- About 170 miles south-southeast of Brownsville TX or about 210
miles south-southeast of Port Mansfield TX
- 23.6N 96.4W
- Storm Intensity 35 mph
- Movement Northwest or 325 degrees at 13 mph
SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
At 10 AM CDT, Potential Tropical Cyclone Four was located at 23.6
North and 96.4 West and continues to move northwestward around 13 mph.
Landfall is expected along the northeast Mexican coast, about 50 to 60
mile south of Brownsville, early this evening. Heavy rainfall leading
to localized flooding, occasional to frequent tropical storm-force
wind gusts, and minor coastal flooding at area beaches continues to be
the main impacts to Deep South Texas through the overnight hours
tonight. Wave run-up may push near or into the dunes at South Padre
Island and Boca Chica beaches. Conditions will gradually improve
through the day on Sunday.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible
limited impacts across The Rio Grande Valley and Deep South Texas.
Potential impacts include:
- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.
- Arroyos and larger creeks may quickly rise with swift currents.
Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may become swollen
and overflow in spots.
- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually
vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding of water
occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage
areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become
near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge
closures.
* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across
portions of the mid-and-lower Rio Grande Valley. Potential impacts in
this area include:
- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored
mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or
uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are
shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.
- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban
or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on
bridges and other elevated roadways.
- Scattered power and communications outages.
Elsewhere across The Rio Grande Valley and Deep South Texas, little
to no impact is anticipated.
* SURGE:
Protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited
impacts across South Padre Island and Boca Chica beaches. Potential
impacts in this area include:
- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along
immediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas
farther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.
- Sections of near-shore roads and exposed parking lots could
become covered with some surge water. Driving conditions
dangerous in places where surge water covers the road.
- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly
in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.
- Minor damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. A few
small craft broken away from moorings.
Elsewhere across The Rio Grande Valley and Deep South Texas, little
to no impact is anticipated.
* TORNADOES:
Little to no impacts are anticipated at this time across The Rio
Grande Valley and Deep South Texas.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:
Now is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and
property in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a
safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
If you are a visitor, be sure to know the name of the city or town in
which you are staying and the name of the county in which it resides.
Listen for these locations in local news updates. Pay attention for
instructions from local authorities.
Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets
for official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes
to the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather
warnings.
