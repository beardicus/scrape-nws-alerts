<description>...Light dusting of snow possible for northern portions of Clarke,
Choctaw, Wayne, and Wilcox counties...
Light snow is being reported across Choctaw and northern Clarke
counties at this time and expected to continue over the next
several hours along and north of highway 84. A light dusting of
snow on elevated grassy surface could be possible. Current radar
and storm reports suggest a band of heavier snow located along
and north of Interstate 20 just north of Choctaw county. We will
need to closely monitor this band throughout the morning and if
this band does enter Choctaw county, a winter weather advisory may
be needed. No significant impacts are expected; however, elevated
roads and bridges may become icy if heavier rates are achieved.</description>
