<instruction>These winds can down small tree limbs and branches, and blow around

Funnel clouds can touch down and produce waterspouts. Although

property damage and serious injury.
Persons participating in outdoor activities should seek sturdy
shelter until these storms pass. Open shelters found in parks,
beaches, or golf courses offer no protection from the dangers of
lightning.</instruction>
