<headline>Winter Weather Advisory issued January 16 at 3:42PM EST until January 17 at 1:00PM EST by NWS Gray/Portland</headline>
<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM TO 1 PM EST
MONDAY...
* WHAT...A brief period of heavy snow expected before a change
over to rain occurs. Total snow accumulations of 3 to 5 inches.
Strong winds are also expected with gusts up to 60 mph.
* WHERE...Coastal York and Coastal Cumberland Counties.
* WHEN...From 1 AM to 1 PM EST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Roads will become snow covered and slippery. Intense
snowfall rates will make for worse driving conditions than
usual, and a switch to rain will make remaining snow covered
roads even more slippery. Strong winds may cause power outages.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Heavy snowfall rates are anticipated, with
rates of 1 to 3 inches per hour expected at times. The snow is
then expected to change to rain during the late morning and
early afternoon. Clogged storm drains may lead to ponding of
water on roadways once precipitation changes to rain. Cold and
windy conditions return Monday night and Tuesday with low wind
chill values developing.</description>
