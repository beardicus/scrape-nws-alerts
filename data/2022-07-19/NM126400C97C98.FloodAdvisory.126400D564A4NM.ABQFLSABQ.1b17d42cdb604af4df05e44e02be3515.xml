<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood

Both localized and distant heavy rainfall will create sudden and
dangerous flows in arroyos and over low water crossings.
Remember, ditches are deadly. A gentle flow of water can become a
raging torrent in a few minutes.</instruction>
