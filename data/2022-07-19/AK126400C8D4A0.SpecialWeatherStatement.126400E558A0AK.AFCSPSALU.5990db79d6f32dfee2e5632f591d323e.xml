<description>...STORM SYSTEM EXPECTED TO BRING INCREASED WINDS AND SURF TO
COASTAL BRISTOL BAY WEDNESDAY...
A frontal system moving southward through the Bering Wednesday
morning is expected to bring increased winds and surf to coastal
Bristol Bay. This is a change from what most of the summer has
been so far with tranquil conditions. Winds are expected to
increase out of the south Wednesday morning throughout Bristol
Bay. Winds are expected to peak between 35-45 mph (30-40kts)
during the late morning to early afternoon hours as well as change
direction to more southwesterly. Winds are expected to slowly
diminish during the late afternoon and early evening hours
Wednesday as the frontal system continues moving southward.
As a result, expecting an increase in surf to near or slightly
above (up to 1 foot) the highest astronomical tide especially
between Togiak and Cape Constantine. Due to this, some very minor
coastal flooding is possible Wednesday morning/afternoon.
