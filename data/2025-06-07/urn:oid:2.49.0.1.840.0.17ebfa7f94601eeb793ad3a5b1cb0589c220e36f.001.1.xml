        <headline>Air Quality Alert issued June 7 at 5:06PM CDT by NWS Aberdeen SD</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has issued an Air
Quality Alert for fine particles pollution. The Air Quality Index
(AQI) is expected to reach the Orange or Unhealthy for Sensitive
Groups category.

* WHERE...All of Minnesota.

* WHEN...From 11 PM CDT this evening to 11 PM CDT Sunday.

* IMPACTS...Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease
(including asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults, may
experience health effects.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Heavy surface Canadian wildfire smoke will
follow a cold front into and across Minnesota from west to east from
late Saturday night into Sunday morning and afternoon, and then clear
out from west to east across the state from Sunday afternoon through
Sunday evening. Some areas may only see a few hours of alert-level
smoke concentrations due to the relatively fast movement of the
north-south band of smoke. The air quality alert may need to be
extended into Monday if an additional batch of heavy smoke
materializes from Manitoba and Saskatchewan wildfires and then is
transported into and across Minnesota from north to south, but
confidence for this outcome is currently low to medium.
</description>
        <instruction>Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including
asthma), heart disease, and children and older adults, should limit
prolonged or heavy exertion.

Reduce or eliminate activities that contribute to air pollution, such
as outdoor burning, and use of residential wood burning devices.
Reduce vehicle trips and vehicle idling as much as possible.

Keep windows closed overnight to prevent smoke from getting indoors.</instruction>
