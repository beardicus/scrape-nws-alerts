Claytor Lake State Park, or near Allisonia, moving north at 10 mph.
HAZARD...Winds in excess of 30 mph and pea size hail.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around
unsecured objects. Minor damage to outdoor objects is
possible.

Allisonia...
Graysontown...
Claytor Lake State Park...
and Claytor Dam.
MAX HAIL SIZE...0.25 IN
MAX WIND GUST...30 MPH</description>
<instruction>If you are on Claytor Lake, move to shore immediately. You do not
want to be caught on the lake during a thunderstorm.
If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.
Locally heavy rain will quickly reduce visibility and result in
ponding of water on roadways, standing water in low lying areas, and
minor flooding of creeks, streams, and areas of poor drainage.
Drivers are urged to slow down and use extra caution to avoid
hydroplaning.
Frequent cloud to ground lightning is occurring with this storm.
Lightning can strike 10 miles away from a thunderstorm. Seek a safe
shelter inside a building or vehicle.</instruction>
