<headline>Flood Watch issued July 05 at 11:32AM CDT  by NWS Chicago</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM 2 PM UNTIL 9 PM CDT THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...A portion of northeast Illinois, including the following
areas, Central Cook, DuPage, Northern Cook and Southern Cook.
* WHEN...Until 9 PM CDT this evening.
* IMPACTS...Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks.
Underpasses may be flooded. Roads and streets may be flooded.
Basements may flood.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Showers and thunderstorms are expected to develop across the
area this afternoon and evening. Although storm movement is
expected to be fast enough to reduce the duration of heavy
rainfall for any one location, high atmospheric moisture
content will support high rain rates up to 1 to 2 inches per
hour. Soil moisture remains elevated from recent heavy
rainfall occurring in the central Chicago Metro Area. Some
flood storage reservoirs also remain nearly full. Central
Cook County has the highest threat of flash flooding if
heavier thunderstorms occur.

<instruction>A Flood Watch for flash flooding means rapid-onset flooding is
possible, but not yet certain, based upon the latest forecasts.
Flash flooding is a dangerous situation. Monitor the latest
forecasts and be prepared to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
