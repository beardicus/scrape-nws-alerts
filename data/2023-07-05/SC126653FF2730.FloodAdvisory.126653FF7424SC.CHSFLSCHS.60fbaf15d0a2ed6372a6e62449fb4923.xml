* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.
* WHERE...A portion of southeast South Carolina, including the
following counties, Berkeley and Charleston.
* WHEN...Until 545 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 342 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
thunderstorms. Minor flooding is ongoing or expected to begin
shortly in the advisory area. A cluster of nearly stationary
thunderstorms is expected to remain between Shadowmoss to the
Interstate 526 corridor of Mount Pleasant through most of the
remainder of this afternoon. So far, radar estimated rainfall
indicates that between 1.5 to 3 inches of rainfall has fallen
across the area. The ongoing runoff combined with additional
heavy rainfall will likely lead to hazardous travel
conditions on area roadways.
- Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are expected
over the area. This additional rain will result in minor
flooding.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
North Charleston, Mount Pleasant, Downtown Charleston, Daniel
Island, West Ashley, Charleston Naval Complex, Riverfront
Park, Cooper River Marina, Park Circle, James Edward Bridge,
Hobcaw Point, Westmoreland Bridge, Wando Terminal, Snowden
and Shadowmoss.</description>
