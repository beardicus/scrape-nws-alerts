<description>...HIGH SURF ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM AST SUNDAY...
...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Life-threatening rip currents due to breaking waves up to
10 ft through Sunday, then between 6 and 8 feet and higher at
times.
* WHERE...Beaches of Culebra.
* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, through 6 PM AST Sunday
evening. For the High Rip Current Risk, through Thursday
afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming conditions and localized beach
erosion. Rip currents that can sweep even the best swimmers
away from shore into deeper water where it becomes difficult
to return to safety.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.
A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in
the advisory area, producing localized beach erosion and
dangerous swimming conditions.</instruction>
