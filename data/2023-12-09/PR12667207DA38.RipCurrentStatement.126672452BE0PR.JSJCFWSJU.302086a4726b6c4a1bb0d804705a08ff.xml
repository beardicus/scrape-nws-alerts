<headline>Rip Current Statement issued December 09 at 4:14AM AST until December 13 at 6:00AM AST by NWS San Juan</headline>
<description>...HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE TUESDAY
NIGHT...
* WHAT...Life-threatening rip currents due to breaking waves
between 6 and 8 feet and higher at times.
* WHERE...Beaches of Culebra, St. Thomas, and St. John.
* WHEN...Through late Tuesday night.
* IMPACTS...Rip currents that can sweep even the best swimmers
away from shore into deeper water where it becomes difficult
to return to safety.</description>
<instruction>There is a high risk of rip currents.
Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties
and piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.
If you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain
calm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for
help. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to
shore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to
swim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.</instruction>
