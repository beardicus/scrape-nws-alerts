<headline>Flood Watch issued December 09 at 11:40AM EST  by NWS Caribou</headline>
<description>...Heavy Rain and Snowmelt Flooding Sunday night into Monday night...
A strong low pressure system will bring heavy rainfall to northern
and eastern Maine. Rainfall of 1 to 3 inches with some locally
higher amounts is expected. The rainfall will combine with snowmelt
and a partially frozen ground to cause small stream, creek and river
flooding.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM LATE SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH
TUESDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...A portion of Central Highlands Maine, including the
following areas, Central Piscataquis and Southern Piscataquis.
* WHEN...From late Sunday night through Tuesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. The Piscataquis River may reach
minor flood stage with a rapid response to snowmelt plus rainfall
in complex terrain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Heavy rainfall and warm temperatures will melt most, if not
all, existing snowpack.  The heavy rainfall, snowmelt, and
high rainfall rates over a partially frozen ground will
create a scenario promoting small stream, creek and river
flooding.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
