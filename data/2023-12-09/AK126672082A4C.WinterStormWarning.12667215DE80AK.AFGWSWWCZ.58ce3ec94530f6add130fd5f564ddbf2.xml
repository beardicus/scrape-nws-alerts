<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued December 09 at 1:19AM AKST until December 09 at 3:00PM AKST by NWS Fairbanks</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 3 PM AKST THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Snow and blowing snow with low visibility. Additional
snow accumulations of 4 inches. Visibility one quarter mile or
less at times. Winds gusting to 60 mph. Freezing spray will
form a thin glaze along north facing shores such as at
Savoonga.
* WHERE...St Lawrence Island.
* WHEN...Until 3 PM AKST Saturday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Strong north winds will cause snow
squalls with periods of very low visibility through Saturday.
The winds combined with temperatures in the teens will cause
freezing spray to accumulate into a light glaze along north
facing shores such as at Savoonga through Saturday. Winds are
expected to decrease Saturday afternoon and blowing snow and
freezing spray will diminish then. Gale force north winds are
expected to return Sunday night and continue into Wednesday
which will bring a return to snow squalls and blowing snow
with low visibility, along with freezing spray at Savoonga.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Warning for snow means severe winter weather
conditions are expected or occurring. This will make travel very
difficult or impossible.</instruction>
