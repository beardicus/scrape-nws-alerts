<headline>Flood Watch issued December 09 at 11:40AM EST until December 11 at 4:00PM EST by NWS Caribou</headline>
<description>...Heavy Rain and Snowmelt Flooding Sunday night into Monday night...
A strong low pressure system will bring heavy rainfall to northern
and eastern Maine. Rainfall of 1 to 3 inches with some locally
higher amounts is expected. The rainfall will combine with snowmelt
and a partially frozen ground to cause small stream, creek and river
flooding.
...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM LATE SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY
MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt continues to be
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Central Highlands, Coastal DownEast, Far
Eastern, Interior DownEast, and Penobscot Valley Maine, including
the following areas, in Central Highlands Maine, Northern
Penobscot. In Coastal DownEast Maine, Coastal Hancock and Coastal
Washington. In Far Eastern Maine, Northern Washington and
Southeast Aroostook. In Interior DownEast Maine, Central
Washington and Interior Hancock. In Penobscot Valley Maine,
Central Penobscot and Southern Penobscot.
* WHEN...From late Sunday night through Tuesday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. The Piscataquis River may reach
minor flood stage with a rapid response to snowmelt plus rainfall
in complex terrain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Heavy rainfall and warm temperatures will melt most, if not
all, existing snowpack.  The heavy rainfall, snowmelt, and
high rainfall rates over a partially frozen ground will
create a scenario promoting small stream, creek and river
flooding.

Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
