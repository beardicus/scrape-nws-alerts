<headline>Blizzard Warning issued December 09 at 3:59PM AKST until December 11 at 5:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 3 AM SUNDAY TO 5 AM
AKST MONDAY...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions and heavy snow expected. Visibility
reduced to one quarter mile at times. Total snow accumulations
of 6 to 12 inches, with local amounts up to 18 inches
possible. Highest snow amounts over interior Bristol Bay,
including Koliganek and New Stuyahok. Northerly winds gusting
30 to 45 mph.
* WHERE...Bristol Bay.
* WHEN...From 3 AM Sunday to 5 AM AKST Monday.
* IMPACTS...Travel will be difficult. Blowing snow and heavy
snow will produce white-out conditions at times.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow and blowing snow will develop first
along the Alaska Peninsula late tonight then spread north and
west across the remainder of the Bristol Bay area Sunday
morning. There is some uncertainty on where the worst conditions
will set up, but right now it looks to be from around King
Salmon northward to New Stuyahok and other inland communities.
Dillingham will be somewhere near the western periphery of the
heaviest snow, so confidence is low on whether they will see
the worst conditions with this storm.</description>
<instruction>A Blizzard Warning means severe winter weather conditions are
expected or occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds
and poor visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout
conditions, making travel very hazardous. If you must travel,
have a winter survival kit with you.If you get stranded, stay
with your vehicle.</instruction>
