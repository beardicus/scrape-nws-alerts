<headline>Winter Storm Watch issued December 09 at 5:08AM AKST until December 11 at 9:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH
MONDAY MORNING FROM DILLINGHAM, NORTHEAST...
* WHAT...Blizzard conditions possible. Total snow accumulations of
4 to 8 inches possible. Winds could gust as high as 40 mph.
Visibility down to a quarter of a mile at times.
* WHERE...Bristol Bay from Dillingham, northeast.
* WHEN...From Sunday morning through Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery conditions. Areas of blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility and cause drifting snow.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...An upper low will lift into the Greater
Bristol Bay area on Sunday bringing with it a combination of
snow and gusty winds. Blowing snow will become an increasing
concern with periods of reduced visibility down to a quarter of
a mile at times. There are still some uncertainties with exact
snow amounts, but gusty conditions are likely. Any snow that
does fall should easily become transportable.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Watch for blizzard conditions means there is a
potential for falling and/or blowing snow with strong winds and
extremely poor visibilities. This can lead to whiteout conditions
and make travel very hazardous.</instruction>
