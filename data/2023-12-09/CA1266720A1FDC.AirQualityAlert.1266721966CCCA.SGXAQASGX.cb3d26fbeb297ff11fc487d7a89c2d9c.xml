<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT DUE TO ELEVATED PARTICLE POLLUTION LEVELS FROM
WINDBLOWN DUST...
The South Coast AQMD has issued an air quality alert due to
increased particle pollution from blowing dust. The air quality
alert is in effect from Saturday at 2 PM until Sunday at 3 PM.
In areas directly impacted by high levels of windblown dust, limit
your exposure by remaining indoors with windows and doors closed and
avoiding vigorous physical activity. Run your air conditioner or an
air purifier. If temperatures allow, avoid using whole house fans or
swamp coolers that bring in outside air.
Exposure to high particle pollution levels can cause serious health
problems, including asthma attacks, heart and lung disease symptoms,
and increased risk of respiratory infections. People with heart or
lung diseases should follow their doctor`s advice for dealing with
episodes of unhealthy air quality. Children, older adults, and
people with respiratory or heart disease should avoid prolonged
exposure and strenuous activities when particle pollution levels are
high.
To help minimize outdoor particle pollution levels:
* Carpool, telecommute, reduce trips, or take public transportation
* Slow down if driving on dirt roads
* Stabilize loose soils
Levels of particle pollution can vary hour by hour and by location
depending on wind conditions.
To view current and forecasted air quality levels, visit the South
Coast Air Quality Management District website at aqmd.gov or
