* WHERE...Strongest winds in the northwestern portions of the Salt
Lake Valley today, and southeast portions of the Salt Lake
Valley this evening. Strong winds will become more widespread

<instruction>People are urged to secure loose objects that could be blown
around or damaged by the wind.
If dense dust is observed blowing across or approaching the
roadway, pull your vehicle off the pavement as far as possible,
stop, turn off lights and set the emergency brake. Do not keep
your foot on the brake as this will illuminate tail lights. If
you cannot leave the roadway, proceed at a lower speed and turn
on lights.</instruction>
