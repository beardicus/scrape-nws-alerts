<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM THIS MORNING TO 8 PM MST
THIS EVENING DUE TO STRONG WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR
FLAGSTAFF AND SURROUNDING AREAS...
The National Weather Service in Flagstaff has issued a Red Flag
Warning due to strong winds and low relative humidity, which is
in effect from 10 AM this morning to 8 PM MST this evening.
* AFFECTED AREA...Locations near Doney Park, Flagstaff and
Williams. This includes portions of the Coconino National
Forest, Kaibab National Forest and Prescott National Forest.
* WINDS...Southwest 15 to 25 mph with gusts up to 45 mph.
* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...10 to 15 percent.
* IMPACTS...The combination of gusty winds and low humidity can
cause fire to rapidly grow in size and intensity before first
responders can contain them.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring or are imminent. A combination of strong
winds and low relative humidities can contribute to extreme fire
behavior.
Avoid outdoor activities that can cause a spark near dry
vegetation, such as yard work, target shooting, or campfires.
Follow local fire restrictions. Check weather.gov/flagstaff for
updates and livingwithfire.info for preparedness tips.
Please notify field crews of this Red Flag Warning.</description>
