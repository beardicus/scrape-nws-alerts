<description>...FREEZE OUTLOOK...
...FREEZING TEMPERATURES POSSIBLE ACROSS PARTS OF SOUTH FLORIDA THIS
WEEKEND...
A strong cold front is forecast to move down the Florida peninsula
Friday night, and move off the southeast Florida coast during the
pre-dawn hours of Saturday. Following the passage of the front,
much colder air driven by gusty northwest winds will push into
South Florida and usher in the coldest temperatures of the season
so far.
The source region of the air mass following the front is from
northern Canada, and only limited modification of this air mass is
expected as it moves directly southward from the northern Plains
into Florida this weekend. As a result, temperatures on Saturday
are forecast to not get out of the 50s over most of the area, and
even southern areas around Miami may struggle to reach 60 degrees
under clearing skies and gusty northwest winds.
This will set the stage for the coldest night and morning which
will likely be Saturday night and Sunday morning. Current
indications are that the probabilities for freezing temperatures
early Sunday morning are increasing over inland Southwest
Florida, primarily Glades, Hendry, inland Collier, and inland Palm
Beach County well away from Lake Okeechobee. In these areas,
duration of temperatures of 32 degrees or below could be as much
as 4 hours. Over the rest of the area, low temperatures Sunday
morning are forecast to range from the mid 30s over the outlying
suburbs of the east and west coasts, upper 30s Gulf coast, and
upper 30s to lower 40s over most of metro Southeast Florida.
Northwest winds will stay in the 5 to 10 mph range Saturday night
and Sunday morning, and as high as 15 mph near the coasts. This
will cause lowest wind chill readings early Sunday to be in the
20s around Lake Okeechobee, and near 30 to the lower 30s
elsewhere.
Another cold night is expected Sunday night and Monday morning,
and although it may not be as cold as Sunday morning, freezing
temperatures and frost may still be a possibility over interior
areas around Lake Okeechobee.
Stay informed on the latest forecasts on the upcoming cold snap.
The next freeze outlook will be issued by midday Thursday.</description>
