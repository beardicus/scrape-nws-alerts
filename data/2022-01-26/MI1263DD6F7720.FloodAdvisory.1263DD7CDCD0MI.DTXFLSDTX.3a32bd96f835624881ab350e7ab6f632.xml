<headline>Flood Advisory issued January 26 at 8:20AM EST  by NWS Detroit</headline>
<description>.An ice blockage remains on the St Clair River just upstream from
Algonac. This is causing some high water along the banks of the St
Clair River, especially across East China Township up to the city of
St Clair.
...FLOOD ADVISORY IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM EST THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Hydrologic flooding caused by an ice blockage.
* WHERE...Along the banks of the St Clair River from Algonac to the
city of St Clair.
* WHEN...Until 800 PM EST Wednesday.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 808 AM EST, Emergency management reported high water due
to an ice blockage on the river.
- Operations will continue today to attempt to break apart the
ice blockage and allow water to flow more easily through the
river channel. In the meantime, the water levels along the
river banks will remain high. Given that the Great Lakes
water levels are lower than this time last year, water levels
are not expected to approach what they did a year ago.
- Some locations that will experience flooding include...
Marine City, East China Township and St Clair.
