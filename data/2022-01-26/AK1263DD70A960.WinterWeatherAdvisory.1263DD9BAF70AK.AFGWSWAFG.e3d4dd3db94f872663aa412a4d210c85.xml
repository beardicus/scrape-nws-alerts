<description>...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM THURSDAY TO 6 PM
AKST FRIDAY...
* WHAT...Blowing snow expected. Plan on difficult travel
conditions. Visibility will be one half mile or less at times.
* WHERE...Dalton Highway Summits.
* WHEN...10 AM Thursday to 6 PM Friday.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...East winds gusting to 45 mph will cause
blowing and drifting snow over Dalton Highway Summits. Look for

visibilities will be limited due to strong winds blowing snow
around. Use caution when traveling, especially in open areas. The
latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.</description>
