<description>...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in New
Mexico...
Pecos River near Artesia 6E affecting Eddy County.
.Thunderstorms producing very heavy rainfall have produced abundant
rainfall on the Pecos watershed upstream of Artesia.  The Pecos
River at Artesia is expected to rise into minor flood over the next
couple of days, dependent on a flood wave coming downstream from
Lake Arthur.

forecast.

SUNDAY AFTERNOON...

flooding occurs about 1/2 mile upstream from the gage and spreads
onto the flood plain.  As a result, river width increases to

areas occurs, but no significant damage is expected.
At 12.5 feet, the river reaches minor flood stage.  Structures at
Wilbank Trucking, Inc., located approximately 1/4 mile east of the
gage, begin to flood.
At 13.5 feet, the river reaches the floor of the instrument shelter.
