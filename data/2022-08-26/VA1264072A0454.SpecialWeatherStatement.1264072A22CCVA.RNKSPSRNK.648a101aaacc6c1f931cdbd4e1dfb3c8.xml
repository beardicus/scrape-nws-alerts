<headline>Special Weather Statement issued August 26 at 6:37PM EDT  by NWS Blacksburg</headline>
<description>...Thunderstorms will impact portions of Pulaski and Montgomery
Counties and the City of Radford through 715 PM EDT...
At 632 PM EDT, Doppler radar was tracking scattered thunderstorms
across the eastern part of the New River Valley, impacting Pulaski
and Montgomery counties. Some of the storms were nearly stationary,
but they were generally moving to the east at 10 mph.
HAZARD...Winds in excess of 30 mph and pea size hail.  Heavy rain
and lightning.
SOURCE...Radar indicated.
IMPACT...Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around
unsecured objects. Minor damage to outdoor objects is
possible.  Runoff from heavy rain could wash debris onto
the highway. Lightning may interrupt the power.
Locations impacted include...
Blacksburg...
Christiansburg...
Radford...
Pulaski...
Dublin...
Pilot...
and Shawsville.
MAX HAIL SIZE...0.25 IN
MAX WIND GUST...30 MPH</description>
<instruction>If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.
Locally heavy rain will quickly reduce visibility and result in
ponding of water on roadways, standing water in low lying areas, and
minor flooding of creeks, streams, and areas of poor drainage.
Drivers are urged to slow down and use extra caution to avoid
hydroplaning.
Occasional cloud to ground lightning is occurring with these storms.
Lightning can strike 10 miles away from a thunderstorm. Seek a safe
shelter inside a building or vehicle.
If on or near Claytor Lake, get out of the water and move indoors or
inside a vehicle. If you can hear thunder, you are close enough to
be struck by lightning. Move to safe shelter now! Do not be caught
on the water in a thunderstorm.</instruction>
