reported in Elliston and parts of the Ellett valley in
Montgomery County.  Amounts close to 2 inches have been
measured in the Radford area near Fairlawn. Amounts of around
1.5 inches have been observed in Newbern, which is south of

<instruction>Now that it is getting dark, be especially cautious at night when it
is harder to recognize the dangers of flooding.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.</instruction>
