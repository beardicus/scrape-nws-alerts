<description>...Elevated Surf Diminishing By This Afternoon...
South winds of 15 to 25 mph will diminish through the morning
with receding surge and decreasing wave action along the coast.
Wave action is combining with storm surge to inundate some low
lying areas, and push water above the normal High Tide Line this
morning. South facing coastlines have seen storm surge values of
2-4 feet above the normal High Tide Line and that will continue
through the morning hours.
The highest water levels have impacted northern Norton Sound from
Nome to Shaktoolik. Water has pushed into low lying areas along
the beach at Golovin. Water may push into low lying areas along
the coast in other areas.
Waves will also be washing up near the top of the beach for the
remainder of the area. Minor beach erosion may occur and belongings
left on the beach could wash away.
