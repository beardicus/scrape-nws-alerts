<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued December 16 at 5:28AM AKST until December 17 at 3:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM THIS MORNING TO 3 AM
AKST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 6 to 12
inches. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph through Portage Valley.
* WHERE...East Turnagain Arm.
* WHEN...From 11 AM this morning to 3 AM AKST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on hazardous travel conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Light snow and gusty winds will develop by
late Saturday morning. The snow will become heavier throughout
the afternoon, reaching rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour between
4 pm and 10 pm. The combination of heavy snow and gusty winds
will significantly reduce visibility. Temperatures will warm
into the lower to mid 30s with this event. As such, blowing snow
should not be a concern during periods of heavier snow this
afternoon and evening. Rain may mix with snow around Portage at
times. Any rain will help lower overall snow amounts. The snow
is expected to taper off Sunday morning.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Warning for snow means severe winter weather
conditions will make travel very hazardous. If you must travel,
keep an extra flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case
of an emergency.
