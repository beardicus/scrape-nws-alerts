<description>...STRONG WIND GUSTS AND AREAS OF BLOWING SNOW LIKELY FOR THE
ANCHORAGE HILLSIDE THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING. WIDESPREAD SNOW FOR
THE ANCHORAGE BOWL SATURDAY NIGHT...
Southeasterly winds will develop this morning along Turnagain Arm
and across the Anchorage Hillside and increase through this
afternoon. These winds will peak in intensity this evening with
sustained winds of 30 to 45 mph and gusts to 65 mph. The
strongest wind gusts are expected on the Anchorage Hillside.
Localized areas of blowing snow are likely with these gusty winds.
Winds will then quickly diminish and shift to the southwest as a
frontal system moves through. The shift in winds will also allow
snow to develop across the Anchorage Bowl. 2 to 4 inches of snow,
with locally higher amounts, are possible Saturday night through
early Sunday morning. Southerly wind gusts to 25 mph may cause
localized areas of blowing and drifting snow across the Anchorage
Bowl Sunday.</description>
