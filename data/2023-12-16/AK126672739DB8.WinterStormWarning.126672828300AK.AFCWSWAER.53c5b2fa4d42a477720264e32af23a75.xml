<headline>Winter Storm Warning issued December 16 at 5:38AM AKST until December 17 at 3:00AM AKST by NWS Anchorage</headline>
<description>...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM THIS
AFTERNOON TO 3 AM AKST SUNDAY...
* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 6 to 12
inches. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph near Whittier and 30
mph through Turnagain Pass.
* WHERE...Whittier and Turnagain Pass to Summit Lake.
* WHEN...From 11 AM this morning to 3 AM AKST Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Plan on hazardous travel conditions.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Light snow and gusty winds will develop
by late Saturday morning. The snow will become heavier
throughout the afternoon, reaching rates of 1 to 2 inches per
hour between 4 pm and 10 pm. The combination of heavy snow and
gusty winds will significantly reduce visibility. Temperatures
will warm into the mid 30s with this event. As such, blowing
snow should not be a concern during periods of heavier snow
this afternoon and evening. Rain may mix with snow around
Whittier at times. Any rain will help lower overall snow
amounts. The snow is expected to taper off Sunday morning.</description>
<instruction>A Winter Storm Warning for snow means severe winter weather
conditions will make travel very hazardous. If you must travel,
keep an extra flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case
of an emergency.
