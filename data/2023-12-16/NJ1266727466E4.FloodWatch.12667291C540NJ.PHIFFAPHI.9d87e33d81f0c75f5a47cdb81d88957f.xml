in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rainfall totals of 1.5 to 3.0 inches are forecast across the
watch area Sunday into Monday, with the heaviest falling
overnight Sunday night. The ground is more saturated due to
heavier rain over the last couple of weeks. A period of
higher hourly rainfall rates will be possible later Sunday
night into early Monday morning, and this can locally enhance
the flooding especially in some urban areas.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
