- Rainfall totals of 2 to 3 inches with locally higher amounts
are forecast across the watch area Sunday into Monday. The
heaviest rainfall is expected to fall overnight on Sunday and

and the already saturated grounds due to heavier rain over
the last week could result in streams across the area
experiencing rapid increases and flooding along low-lying and
flood-prone locations.
