<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT...
The following message is transmitted at the request of the New Mexico
Departments of Health and Environment, United States Forest Service
and the Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality Response Program.
* WHAT...Smoke from the Black and Bear Trap fires will be transported
toward the southeast through the remainder of the afternoon and into
the evening by strong and gusty northwesterly winds. Meanwhile, much
cooler temperatures (highs 15 to 25 degrees below normal), increased
humidity and scattered showers and thunderstorms over and near the
Hermits Peak - Calf Canyon fire will continue to significantly limit
fire growth and smoke production. Going into Wednesday, a marked
warming trend will commence with dry weather expected. Transport
winds broadly from the north and northwest will continue into the
day Wednesday but speeds will be significantly less especially
across the southwest quarter.
* WHERE...Of particular concern will be locations and communities
south and southeast of the Black and Bear Trap fires especially in
the Lower Rio Grande valley corridor to include Hatch, Radium
Springs and Las Cruces in Sierra and northern Dona Ana counties
where brief periods of UNHEALTHY air quality can be expected.
Elsewhere, significant impacts from smoke are expected to persist
across much of Catron, western Socorro, northern Grant, northern
Luna and western Sierra counties. More details on impacted locations
and latest air quality information can be found at
https://fire.airnow.gov
* WHEN...Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1 pm MDT
Wednesday, May 25.
* IMPACTS...Those with conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and heart
disease will be especially vulnerable to impacts from poor air
quality, as will adults over age 65, young children, and pregnant
women if smoke concentrations become unhealthy.
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method available
at https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/IndoorQuality.html and
https://cv.nmhealth.org
New Mexicans will also need to take steps to keep their homes cool to
avoid heat-related illnesses. NMDOH offers tips here:
