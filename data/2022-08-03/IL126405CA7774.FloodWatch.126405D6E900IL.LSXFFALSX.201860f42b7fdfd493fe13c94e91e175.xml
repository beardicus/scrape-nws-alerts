<headline>Flood Watch issued August 03 at 1:45PM CDT until August 03 at 7:00PM CDT by NWS Saint Louis</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM 10 PM CDT THIS EVENING THROUGH
THURSDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Illinois, including the following areas, Bond
IL, Clinton IL, Fayette IL, Marion IL, Monroe IL, Randolph IL,
Saint Clair and Washington IL. Portions of Missouri, including the
following areas, Crawford MO, Iron MO, Jefferson MO, Madison MO,

MO.
* WHEN...From 10 PM CDT this evening through Thursday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Widespread thunderstorms capable of producing rain rates in
excess of 2 inches per hour are expected to develop between
late afternoon and early evening today, and will expand in
coverage as they spread south during the evening and
overnight hours. In addition to very high instantaneous rain
rates, multiple rounds of thunderstorms are likely to move
over the same areas repeatedly across localized areas.
Widespread rain amounts of 1 to 3 inches are expected, with
locally higher amounts between 3 and 6 inches possible as
well. While the flash flooding threat may be localized and
conditional, the threat may be locally higher in areas that
have received copious rainfall in recent days.</description>
<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action
should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.</instruction>
