<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM PDT THIS
AFTERNOON FOR ALPINE, NORTHERN MONO AND DOUGLAS COUNTIES...
At 414 PM PDT, thunderstorms are producing heavy rain across the
warned area. Grover Hot Springs State Park Employee and California
Highway Patrol confirmed several debris flows crossing Grover Hot
Springs Road with large boulders on the road.
Up to 2.27 inches of rain have fallen at Markleeville, California,
in one hour at the MUL1296 Liberty mesonet.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar is resulting in debris flows
moving through the Tamarack burn scar. The debris flow can consist
of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Grover Hot Springs State Park Employee and California
Highway Patrol
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,
highways, streets and underpasses as well as other poor
drainage and low-lying areas.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Topaz Lake, Alpine Village, Woodfords, Grover Hot Springs, Mesa
Vista, Alpine County Airport, Indian Creek Reservoir, Junction CA 89
And CA 4, Indian Creek Campground, Turtle Rock Campground,
Markleeville and Holbrook Junction.

FLASH FLOOD...OBSERVED
EXPECTED RAINFALL RATE...1.5-2 INCHES IN 1 HOUR</description>
<instruction>A Flash Flood Warning for a recent burn area means that flooding
and/or debris flows are imminent or occurring. Residents living in
or immediately downstream should take immediate precautions to
protect life. Quickly move away from the burn area only if it is
safe to do so, otherwise shelter in place and move to a second story
or the highest location in your home to stay out of the path of
fast-moving water and debris flows.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
