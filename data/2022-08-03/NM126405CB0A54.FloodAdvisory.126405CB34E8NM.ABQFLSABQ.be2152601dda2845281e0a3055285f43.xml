- At 418 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated heavy rain due to
nearly stationary thunderstorms. This will cause arroyo and
small stream flooding. Up to 2.15 inches of rain have fallen
over Arroyo Chinchonte.  Heavy rain was also developing over
Arroyo de Tajique.
- Additional rainfall amounts up to 1 inch are expected over
the area. The potential exists for flash flooding to develop.

Estancia, McIntosh, Tajique and Torreon.
- Hazardous water levels are expected within Arroyo Chinchonte
downstream through Estancia.

<instruction>Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Arroyos, streams, and normally dry rivers can become raging killer
currents in a matter of minutes. Water in arroyos can travel many
miles and take hours to reach your location from upstream rain areas.</instruction>
