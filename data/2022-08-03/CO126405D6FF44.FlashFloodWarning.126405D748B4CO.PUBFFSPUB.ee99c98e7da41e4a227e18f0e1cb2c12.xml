<headline>Flash Flood Warning issued August 03 at 6:57PM MDT until August 03 at 8:45PM MDT by NWS Pueblo</headline>
<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING FOR THE SPRING BURN SCAR REMAINS IN EFFECT
UNTIL 845 PM MDT THIS EVENING FOR NORTHEASTERN COSTILLA AND WEST
CENTRAL HUERFANO COUNTIES...
At 657 PM MDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms that were
producing heavy rain over the Spring Burn Scar have weakened, but
light rain is ongoing. Between 1 and 2 inches of rain have fallen.
Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the warning area may cause mud slides near
steep terrain. The mud slide can consist of rock, mud, vegetation
and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms producing
flash flooding in and around the Spring Burn Scar.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Life threatening flash flooding of areas in and around
the Spring Burn Scar.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Spring Burn Scar north of Highway 160, northwestern Spring Burn
Scar south of Highway 160 in Huerfano county, northern Spring Burn
Scar south of Highway 160 in Costilla county and La Veta Pass.
This includes the following high risk locations...
South Abeyta Creek near County Road 443, South Abeyta Creek near
County Road 442, South Abeyta Creek near County Road 441 and Pass
Creek Road.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
FLASH FLOOD DAMAGE THREAT...CONSIDERABLE</description>
<instruction>This is a life threatening situation. Heavy rainfall will cause
extensive and severe flash flooding of creeks...streams...and
ditches in the Spring Burn Scar. Severe debris flows can also be
anticipated across roads. Roads and driveways may be washed away in
places. If you encounter flood waters...climb to safety.
Move away from recently burned areas. Life-threatening flooding of
creeks, roads and normally dry arroyos is likely. The heavy rains
will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep
terrain, especially in and around these areas.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.</instruction>
