<description>...FLASH FLOOD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM PDT THIS
AFTERNOON FOR ALPINE, NORTHERN MONO AND DOUGLAS COUNTIES...
At 327 PM PDT, Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing heavy
rain across the warned area. Between 0.5 and 1 inch of rain has
fallen. The expected rainfall rate is 0.5 inches in 10 minutes.
Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.
Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in debris flow
moving through the Tamarack. The debris flow can consist of rock,
mud, vegetation and other loose materials.
HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.
SOURCE...Radar.
IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,
highways, streets and underpasses as well as other poor
drainage and low-lying areas.
Some locations that will experience flash flooding include...
Topaz Lake, Alpine Village, Woodfords, Grover Hot Springs, Mesa
Vista, Alpine County Airport, Indian Creek Reservoir, Junction CA
89 And CA 4, Indian Creek Campground, Turtle Rock Campground,
Markleeville and Holbrook Junction.
FLASH FLOOD...RADAR INDICATED
EXPECTED RAINFALL RATE...0.5 INCHES IN 10 MINUTES</description>
<instruction>A Flash Flood Warning for a recent burn area means that flooding
and/or debris flows are imminent or occurring. Residents living in
or immediately downstream should take immediate precautions to
protect life. Quickly move away from the burn area only if it is
safe to do so, otherwise shelter in place and move to a second story
or the highest location in your home to stay out of the path of
fast-moving water and debris flows.
Turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.
Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become
unstable and unsafe.
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded
roads. Find an alternate route.
Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law
enforcement and request they pass this information to the National
Weather Service when you can do so safely.</instruction>
