        <headline>Coastal Flood Advisory issued October 9 at 3:27PM EDT until October 11 at 5:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City NC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, strong longshore
currents in the surf zone. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, 1
to 3 feet of inundation above ground level expected in low-
lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways. For the
Coastal Flood Watch, 2 to 4 feet of inundation above ground
level possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways.

* WHERE...Ocracoke Island.

* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, through this evening.
For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 5 PM EDT Saturday. For
the Coastal Flood Watch, from Saturday afternoon through
Monday morning.

* IMPACTS...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to 1 to 3 feet of
inundation above ground level with minor ocean overwash
possible in vulnerable locations along shorelines and tidal
waterways. For the Coastal Flood Watch, up to 2 to 4 feet of
inundation above ground level is possible in some areas near
shorelines and tidal waterways resulting in an elevated threat
of property damage around the times of high tide. Flooding
will extend inland from the waterfront threatening some homes
and businesses. Road closures and flooding of vehicles will be
possible, most notably along NC 12 where ocean overwash may
make several portions of the highway inaccessible across
Ocracoke and Hatteras Islands. Strong longshore currents will
create dangerous swimming conditions.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A strong coastal storm will develop this
weekend off the North Carolina coast, and has the potential to
bring stronger winds and higher water levels to the area.
Depending on the exact track and strength of the low, there is
potential for moderate to locally major coastal flooding
impacts from ocean overwash, and users are urged to check back
in on the forecast the rest of the week.

        <instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.

Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
