        <headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued October 9 at 8:40PM EDT until October 10 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City NC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, 1 to 2 feet of inundation
above ground level expected in low- lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways. For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous
rip currents and strong longshore currents in the surf zone.

* WHERE...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, areas along Bogue Banks
beaches, Bogue Sound, the Newport and White Oak Rivers, and
adjacent tidal creeks, and areas in North Topsail Beach, the
lower New River, and adjacent tidal creeks. For the Beach
Hazards Statement, beaches in Western Carteret and Coastal
Onslow Counties.

* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 8 AM EDT Monday.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, from 8 AM EDT Friday through
Friday evening.

* IMPACTS...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to 1 to 2 feet of
inundation above ground level is possible in low-lying areas
near shorelines and tidal waterways resulting in a low threat of
property damage. Some roads and low lying property including
parking lots, parks, lawns, and homes adjacent to the waterfront
will experience shallow flooding. For the Beach Hazards
Statement, rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water. Strong longshore currents will
create dangerous swimming conditions.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A strong coastal storm will develop this
weekend off the North Carolina coast, and has the potential to
bring stronger winds and higher water levels to the area.

        <instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.

Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.

Strong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip
currents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many
cases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers
from being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it
difficult to return to shore.</instruction>
