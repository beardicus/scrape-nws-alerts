        <description>* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to 1 to 2 feet of
inundation above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways. For the Beach Hazards
Statement, dangerous rip currents and large breaking waves
expected in the surf zone.

* WHERE...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, areas along the beaches,
Albemarle, Croatan, and Roanoke Sounds, Kitty Hawk Bay, and
adjacent tidal creeks. For the Beach Hazards Statement, Northern
Outer Banks beaches.

* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 8 AM EDT Monday.
For the Beach Hazards Statement, from 8 AM EDT Friday through

* IMPACTS...Up to 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level is
possible in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
resulting in a low threat of property damage. Some roads and low
lying property including parking lots, parks, lawns, and homes
adjacent to the waterfront will experience shallow flooding. Rip
currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into
deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw a swimmer or
surfer head first into the bottom causing neck and back
injuries. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away
from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore break can throw a
swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom causing neck and
back injuries.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A strong coastal storm will develop this
weekend off the North Carolina coast, and has the potential to
bring stronger winds and higher water levels to the area.
Depending on the exact track and strength of the low, Coastal
Flood Warning conditions may be met at some time this weekend,
and users are urged to check back in on the forecast the rest of
the week..

        <instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.

Life-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain
calm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,
float or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.

Shore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is
extremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you
are in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at
all times.</instruction>
