        <headline>Beach Hazards Statement issued October 9 at 5:56AM EDT until October 9 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Newport/Morehead City NC</headline>
        <description>* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, dangerous rip currents
and strong longshore currents in the surf zone. For the Coastal
Flood Advisory, up to 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground
level expected in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal
waterways.

* WHERE...East Carteret County.

* WHEN...For the Beach Hazards Statement, through this evening.
For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 8 AM EDT Monday.

* IMPACTS...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to 1 to 2 feet of
inundation above ground level is possible in low-lying areas
near shorelines and tidal waterways resulting in a low threat of
property damage. Some roads and low lying property including
parking lots, parks, lawns, and homes adjacent to the waterfront
will experience shallow flooding. Rip currents can sweep even
the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water. Strong
longshore currents will create dangerous swimming conditions.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A strong coastal storm will develop this
weekend off the North Carolina coast, and has the potential to
bring stronger winds and higher water levels to the area.
Depending on the exact track and strength of the low, Coastal
Flood Warning conditions may be met at some time this weekend,
and users are urged to check back in on the forecast the rest of
the week. The most likely time for strong rip currents to occur
is a couple hours either side of low tide, which will occur
around 4:00 PM Thursday.

        <instruction>If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be
closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone
property.

A Beach Hazards Statement is issued when threats such as rip
currents, longshore currents, and other hazards create
life-threatening conditions in the surf zone. Caution should be
used when in or near the water.</instruction>
