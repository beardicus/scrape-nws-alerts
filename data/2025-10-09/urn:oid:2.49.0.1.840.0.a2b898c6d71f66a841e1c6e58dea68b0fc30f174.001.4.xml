        <description>* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, minor coastal flooding.
For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents. For the

* IMPACTS...Coastal roads may be closed. Low lying property

Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach

from shore into deeper water.
</description>
        <instruction>Coastal flooding is occurring or imminent. Coastal residents in
the warned area should be alert for rising water, and take
appropriate action to protect life and property. If travel is
required, do not drive around barricades or through water of
unknown depth.

High surf will affect the beaches in the advisory area, producing
localized beach erosion and dangerous swimming conditions.
Swimmers should remain out of the water due to large breaking
waves and dangerous surf conditions.

Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away
from shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the
sandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as jetties and
piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and
signs.

Entering the surf is strongly discouraged. If caught in a rip
current, relax and float. Don't swim against the current. If
able, swim in a direction following the shoreline. If unable to
escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.</instruction>
