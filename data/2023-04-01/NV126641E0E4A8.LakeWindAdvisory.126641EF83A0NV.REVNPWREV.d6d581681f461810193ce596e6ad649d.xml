<headline>Lake Wind Advisory issued April 01 at 3:18PM PDT until April 02 at 11:00AM PDT by NWS Reno</headline>
<description>...LAKE WIND ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 AM PDT SUNDAY
FOR PYRAMID LAKE...
...WIND ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM TO 11 PM PDT
SUNDAY...
* CHANGES...None.
* WHAT...For the Lake Wind Advisory, west winds 15 to 25 mph
with gusts up to 45 mph expected. Waves 1 to 3 feet. For the
Wind Advisory, west winds 20 to 30 mph with gusts up to 55 mph
expected.
* WHERE...Western Nevada Basin and Range including Pyramid Lake.
* WHEN...For the Lake Wind Advisory, from 8 AM Saturday to 11 AM
PDT Sunday. For the Wind Advisory, from 11 AM to 11 PM PDT
Sunday.
* IMPACTS...Gusty winds could blow down tree limbs and a few
power outages may result. Patchy blowing dust could reduce
visibility at times to less than one mile. This may bring
periods of reduced visibility to I-80, US-50, and US-95. Lake
waters will be rough, and small boats, kayaks and paddle
boards will be prone to capsizing.</description>
<instruction>Now is the time to secure loose outdoor items such as patio
furniture, holiday decorations, and trash cans before winds
increase which could blow these items away. The best thing to do
is prepare ahead of time by making sure you have extra food and
water on hand, flashlights with spare batteries and/or candles in
the event of a power outage.</instruction>
