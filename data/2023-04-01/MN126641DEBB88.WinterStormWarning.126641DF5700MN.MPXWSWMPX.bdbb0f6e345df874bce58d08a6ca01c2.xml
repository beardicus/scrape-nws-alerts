times.

central through southern Minnesota into western Wisconsin, along
with a Winter Storm Warning for Freeborn county MN.

inches. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.

* WHEN...Until 7 AM CDT this morning.
* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing
snow could significantly reduce visibility. Gusty winds could
bring down tree branches.</description>
