AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Sneaker waves possible.
* WHERE...In Oregon, North Oregon Coast and Central Oregon
Coast. In Washington, South Washington Coast.
* WHEN...Through this afternoon.
* IMPACTS...Sneaker waves can run up on the beach, lifting or
rolling large heavy water soaked logs which can lead to
serious injury or death.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Keep children and pets away from the surf
zone. Keep off of jetties, rocks and logs near the surf zone.
If you see someone swept into the sea do not swim in after
them. Call 911 and keep an eye on them until help arrives.</description>
<instruction>Remain out of the water to avoid hazardous swimming conditions.
Don`t make the beach your grave. Constantly watch the ocean for
changes in wave patterns! Watch the ocean for at least 20 minutes.
Study its wave patterns. Get a feel for the pattern of the waves
before relaxing on the beach or engaging in recreational
activities. Stay farther back from the ocean than you think is
necessary.</instruction>
