<headline>Avalanche Warning issued December 03 at 8:27AM PST  by NWS LasVegas</headline>
<description>The Eastern Sierra Avalanche Center in Mammoth Lakes
has issued a Backcountry Avalanche Warning for the
following areas: the Eastern Sierra in Mono County and
the Eastern Sierra in Inyo County
* WHAT...Widespread high avalanche danger will exist through
Sunday.
* WHERE...The eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range
between Virginia Lakes in the north to Bishop creek to the
south.
* WHEN...In effect from Saturday at 1200 PST to Sunday at 1200
PST.
* IMPACTS...Recent heavy snow combined with wind will likely
create widespread areas of unstable snow.
* PRECAUTIONARY / PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...Very dangerous avalanche
conditions exist. Heavy snowfall combined with strong to extreme
winds and a weak underlying snowpack will likely create
widespread areas of unstable snow. Avalanches may run long
distances and can run into lower angle terrain typically
thought of as safe. Travel in, near, or below avalanche terrain
is not recommended.
Consult http://www.esavalanche.org or www.avalanche.org for more
detailed information.
Similar avalanche danger may exist at locations outside the
coverage area of this or any avalanche center.</description>
