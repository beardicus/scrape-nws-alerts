<description>...Wintry mix including potential freezing rain through Sunday
morning...
A low pressure system along the California and Oregon coast will
bring a mix of snow, rain and possible freezing rain to northern
Nevada. Snow is expected to begin this evening across Humboldt
county. Snow levels will rise steadily through the evening and
overnight hours causing a changeover from snow to a rain/snow mix
across Humboldt county. Sheltered valleys that remain below
freezing through the night may experience a brief period of
freezing rain as well. Although there is only a slight chance for
freezing rain, it does not take much to cause significant travel
impacts. The most susceptible areas to freezing rain impacts will
be bridges and overpasses as they tend to drop below freezing
first.
Precipitation will spread into Elko county overnight with a
similar scenario of snow at the beginning then a changeover to a
rain/snow mix as sunrise on Sunday approaches. Similarly low
chances for freezing rain exists mainly in valley locations that
remain below freezing.
The threat of freezing rain diminishes after sunrise Sunday as
road temperatures recover and air temperatures rise leaving behind
a mix of rain and snow through Sunday afternoon. Snow amounts will
generally be low at less than an inch in valley locations with
snow levels rising to between 6500 and 7000 feet along I-80 by
Sunday morning although northern Elko County and western Humboldt
county could see up to two inches through Sunday night.
