<description>...Elevated Water Levels Possible Sunday Along the Kuskokwim
Delta Coast...
A storm system moving across the Northern Bering over the weekend
will lead to the development of strong southerly winds from
Kuskokwim Bay through the Etolin Strait for Sunday. The strong
southerly winds will bring elevated water levels with the
potential for water pushing up through cracks in the ice and ice
pushing up on shore along south and west facing shorelines. Winds
will shift to the southwest and eventually west by late Sunday
night as a front moves onshore. The greatest chance for elevated
water levels and potential ice shoves is expected to be in an
area of coastline from Quinhagak to Kipnuk.
Water levels are expected to rise Sunday morning with the highest
levels expected late Sunday afternoon before slowly subsiding
Sunday night. A second round of elevated water levels is possible
Monday afternoon as another front moves toward the coast with
increasing southerly winds. Residents with interests along the
coast should move items well above the normal high tide level.
