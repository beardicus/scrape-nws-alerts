<description>...FIRST SIGNIFICANT SNOW OF THE SEASON LIKELY FOR THE MOUNTAINS
THIS WEEKEND...
Significant changes are on the way for the much of the western
Colorado mountains as well as the Eastern Uintas as a strong cold
front moves across the region this weekend. Moisture across the
region will increase to near 200% of normal for late October. The
front will begin to push across the area on Saturday resulting in
widespread precipitation into Sunday. Showers will continue into
early next week as moisture lingers across the area.
The greatest snow accumulations are expected to occur Saturday
night and into midday Sunday. The most snow will fall at
elevations above 9000 feet, though snow levels may drop to
elevations as low as 6000 feet once colder air filters into the
area. On average the Eastern Uintas and the mountains along the
Continental Divide will see 5 to 10 inches above 9000 feet.
Locally higher amounts in excess of a foot will be possible.
Additionally, wind gusts to near 50 mph in the mountains could
lead to reductions in visibility in blowing snow.
This will be the first significant snowfall for the mountains this
season. Snow may lead to periods of difficult travel in the
mountains. Conditions could become treacherous in the backcountry
and should be taken into consideration for hikers, hunters and
other recreators. Please keep up to date on the latest forecast
and any winter highlights by visiting weather.gov/gjt.</description>
