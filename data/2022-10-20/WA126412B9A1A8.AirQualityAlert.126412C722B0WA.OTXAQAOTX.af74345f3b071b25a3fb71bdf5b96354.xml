An Air Quality Advisory for Spokane County has been issued by the Spokane
Regional Clean Air Agency and for Stevens and Pend Oreille Counties
issued by the Washington Department of Ecology in Spokane in effect
through midnight Thursday.
Smoke from regional wildfires will persist through Thursday. The Air
Quality Index is expected to range from MODERATE to UNHEALTHY FOR
SENSITIVE GROUPS based on fine particle pollution (PM2.5) levels.
Sheltered valleys will have a harder time mixing out pollution on
Thursday.
Health Effects and Recommendations: When air quality is in the UNHEALTHY
FOR SENSITIVE GROUPS category, people who are especially sensitive
to air pollution should limit prolonged or heavy exertion and limit
time outdoors. For more information about air quality in Spokane
County, please call the Spokane Regional Clean Air Agency at
