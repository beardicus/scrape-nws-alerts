        <description>* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, up to one half foot of
inundation above ground level expected in low-lying areas due to
tidal flooding. For the Coastal Flood Watch, one to two feet of
inundation above ground level possible in low-lying areas due
to tidal flooding.

* WHERE...Shoreline in Calvert County.

* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, from 5 PM this
afternoon to 11 PM EDT this evening, especially around the
time of high tide. For the Coastal Flood Watch, from late
Wednesday night through late Thursday night, especially around
the time of high tide.

* IMPACTS...For tonight, tide levels around 3.0 feet are expected,
which results in several inches of water on Charles Street and
Williams Street in Solomons, and water is expected to reach
backyards near 9th Street in North Beach, and could approach 9th
Street. For late Wednesday night through late Thursday night,
tide levels of 4.0 feet are possible, which results in portions
of 7th, 8th, and 9th Streets being flooded in North Beach, with
homes affected near 9th Street, and flooding of structures near
Charles Street in Solomons; yards, parking lots, and portions of
both Charles and Williams Street are covered by more than a foot
of water in Solomons.
