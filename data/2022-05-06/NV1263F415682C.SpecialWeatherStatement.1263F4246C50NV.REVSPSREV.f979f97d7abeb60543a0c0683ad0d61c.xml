<description>...WINDY TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY, MUCH COLDER TEMPERATURES SUNDAY
INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK WITH PERIODS OF RAIN AND SNOW SHOWERS...
--Friday--
* Winds will bring travel difficulties both in the air and on the
ground. Travel restrictions for high profile vehicles are
possible. Check with CalTrans and/or NDOT for the current road
information. Areas of blowing dust are possible both afternoons
downwind of the Carson Sink and other desert locations, possibly
affecting portions of I-80, US-50, and US-95. In addition,
backcountry and ski recreation could be impacted along with
choppy conditions on area lakes.
* A few light showers with minimal liquid totals are possible in
far northern Nevada and northeast California.
--Mother`s Day Weekend into Next Week--
* It will remain breezy throughout the weekend, with a secondary
max in wind speeds on Sunday due to a strong cold front. This
front will usher in a much colder air mass Mother`s Day into the
first half of next week. Temperatures will be 15-25 degrees
below normal. While there is still some uncertainty due to
winds and cloud cover, it`s possible we could have frost and
freeze concerns Sunday-Tuesday nights. Might want to watch those
sprinklers and protect any sensitive vegetation.
* We will see periods of rain and snow/pellet showers along with
slight chances for thunderstorms Sunday through Tuesday. There
are solid chances for snow levels to fall to all valley floors
by Sunday evening, which may catch many off guard. Mountain
passes could see a few inches of snow accumulation on roadways
during the overnight periods. It will be harder to see any
roadway snow accumulation for lower valleys given the time of
the year.</description>
