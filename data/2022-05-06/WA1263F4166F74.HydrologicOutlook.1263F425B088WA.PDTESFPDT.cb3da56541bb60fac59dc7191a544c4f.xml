<description>...HEAVY RAIN WITH RISING STREAMS AND RIVERS THROUGH THE WEEKEND...
Thunderstorms will produce moderate to heavy rain across portions of
northeast Oregon and southeast Washington through Saturday.
Rainfall amounts ranging from 0.50 to around 1 inch are expected
with local amounts nearing 1.50 inches.
This will lead to rises on the rivers and streams across this area
as well as ponding of water in low-lying area and fields. In steep
terrain
locations, there will also be a risk of small rock or mud slides.
The heaviest precipitation is expected to occur from tonight through
early Saturday, but it will take some time for all the water to
reach streams with high water levels expected through Saturday and
streams expected to start receding on Sunday.</description>
