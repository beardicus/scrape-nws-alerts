<description>...FLOOD WATCH FOR AN ICE JAM IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY EVENING ALONG
THE YUKON RIVER AT EAGLE...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by an ice jam is possible.
* WHERE...Yukon River at Eagle.
* WHEN...Through Monday evening.
* IMPACTS...The Yukon River may rise above the natural riverbank.
Ice jam flooding has high uncertainty. Impacts could range between
localized high water and severe flooding. Now is the the time to
take precautions. Where possible, move items to higher ground and
prepare your community for possible flooding.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Ice is beginning to shift in the vicinity of Eagle. The river
has risen approximately seven feet over the last seven days
and continues to rise approximately 1 foot every 12 hours.
Tributaries including the Fortymile River and Mission Creek
are running high. The Yukon River at Eagle is likely to
breakup sometime this weekend or early next week and there is
intact ice downstream that could cause ice jams to form.
Breakup on upriver tributaries has been dynamic with ice jams
forming and releasing.

Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
