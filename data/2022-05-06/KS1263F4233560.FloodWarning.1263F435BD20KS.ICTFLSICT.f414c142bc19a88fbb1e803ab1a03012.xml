<instruction>Do not drive into flooded areas or go around barricades. Nearly two
feet of water will carry most vehicles away. Turn around, don`t
drown.
Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.
Flooding is occurring. Most flood related deaths occur in
automobiles. Do not attempt to cross water covered bridges, dips, or
low water crossings. Never try to cross a flowing stream, even a
small one, on foot. To escape rising water find another route over
higher ground.
