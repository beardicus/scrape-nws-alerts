<headline>Flood Watch issued July 11 at 2:54AM EDT until July 11 at 4:00PM EDT by NWS Burlington</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS EVENING...
* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
possible, though the event has become mostly confined to main stem
river flooding as the rainfall rates have decreased. River levels
continue to respond and some dam releases will be taking place,
which will affect streamflows.
* WHERE...Vermont, and in northern New York, Essex, Clinton, and
Franklin Counties.
* WHEN...Through this evening.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water crossings may be
flooded. Storm drains and ditches may become clogged with debris.
Extensive street flooding and flooding of creeks and rivers are
possible. Area creeks and streams are running high and could flood
with more heavy rain.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Widespread 2 to 5 inches of rain has fallen in parts of far
northeastern New York and Vermont, with a strip of 6 to 9
inches along the spine of the Green Mountains. An additional
0.33 to 1.25 inches of rain is expected through today,
tapering off this afternoon. Several rivers across Vermont
are currently in flood, with the Winooski at Montpelier,
Lamoille at Johnson, Mississquoi at North Troy, and Otter
Creek at Center Rutland in major. A few additional rivers are
expected to rise towards flood stage.
