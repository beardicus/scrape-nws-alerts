continues in Huachuca Canyon.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 1232 PM MST, The stream gauge within the Huachuca Canyon
has started to lower but is still running high early this
afternoon.  Thus, small stream flooding is likely continuing
in and a bit downstream of the canyon.  Another round of
thunderstorms are developing over the Huachuca Mountains and
if a heavy rainfall producing storm impacts the upper
Huachuca Basin again today, additional heavy runoff would be
possible.
