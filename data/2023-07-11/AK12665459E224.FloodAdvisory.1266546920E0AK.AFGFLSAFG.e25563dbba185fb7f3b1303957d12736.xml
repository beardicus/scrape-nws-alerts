- At 500 AM AKDT Tuesday, Between 2 and 3 inches of rain fell
Friday night and Saturday in the Northeast Brooks Range and
caused minor flooding on the upper Sagavanirktok and Kuparuk
Rivers. This high water has moved downstream and will reach
the coast this morning. The Kuparuk River at the bridge has
now crested. The Kuparuk River reached 36 feet which is 6
inches above flood stage. Employees with Conoco Phillips
report that the Kuparuk river remains several feet below the
causeway approach to the bridge over the Kuparuk River.
Similar minor flooding conditions are expected along the Sag
River where water levels near Deadhorse should be at their
highest level now.
Water levels on the Kuparuk and Sag Rivers will fall slowly
today and tonight before dropping back below the bank
Wednesday morning.
- Another significant rain event is expected tonight and
Wednesday. This will likely cause the Sag and Kuparuk rivers
to rise to near bankfull again late this week, but additional
flooding is not expected.
- For Kuparuk River near Deadhorse:
At 500 am the stage was 40.00 feet.
Flood Stage is 35.5 feet.
