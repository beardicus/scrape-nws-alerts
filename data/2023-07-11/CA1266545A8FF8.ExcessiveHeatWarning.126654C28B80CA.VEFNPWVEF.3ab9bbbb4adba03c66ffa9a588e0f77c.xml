<headline>Excessive Heat Warning issued July 11 at 11:54AM PDT until July 17 at 5:00PM PDT by NWS LasVegas</headline>
<description>...EXCESSIVE HEAT WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM FRIDAY TO
5 PM PDT MONDAY...
* WHAT...Life-threatening daytime heat and overnight
temperatures struggling to fall below 100. This will result in
a extreme risk of heat related illness for anyone exposed to
the heat for a prolonged period.
* WHERE...Death Valley National Park.
* WHEN...From 11 AM Friday to 5 PM Monday.
* IMPACTS...Several days of extreme heat will result in a major
concern for life-threatening heat illnesses for anyone outside
for an extended period. Anyone without access to adequate
indoor cooling will be especially vulnerable as overnight
temperatures will provide very little, if any, overnight
relief from the heat.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...With high temperatures well over 120
degrees in the daytime and barely falling below 100 at night,
anyone exposed to the outdoors in Death Valley will be facing
an extreme risk of heat related illness, especially anyone
recreating. Temperatures are expected to be well over 100
degrees even in shaded areas like slot canyons. Any prolonged
exposure to the heat is highly discouraged. Anyone who may
encounter car trouble could be facing a life threatening
situation, especially where phone signal prohibits calling for
help.</description>
<instruction>Take an extreme level of precautions if you work or plan on
venturing outside. When possible, reschedule strenuous activities
to other days. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and
heat stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing. To
reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent rest breaks
in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone overcome by
heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location immediately.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
