<headline>Heat Advisory issued July 11 at 11:54AM PDT until July 17 at 5:00PM PDT by NWS LasVegas</headline>
<description>...HEAT ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM FRIDAY TO 5 PM MONDAY...
* WHAT...Dangerously hot afternoons with little overnight relief
expected. This will result in a major to extreme risk of heat
related illness, especially at lower elevations.
* WHERE...Sheep Range and the Spring Mountains including Red Rock
Canyon and Mt. Charleston.
* WHEN...From 11 AM Friday to 5 PM Monday.
* IMPACTS...Several days of extreme heat will result in a major
concern for heat related illnesses for anyone outside for an
extended period. Anyone without access to adequate indoor
cooling will be particularly vulnerable, especially those
visiting the mountains on day trips from lower elevations.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Anyone spending extended periods of time
outside at high elevations are especially at risk for sunburn,
making it harder for the body to cool down. Water, hats,
sunscreen, and access to shade are necessary for outdoor
recreation. Children, the elderly, and people with chronic
ailments are usually the first to suffer from the heat. Heat
exhaustion, cramps or in extreme cases, heat stroke can result
from prolonged exposure to these conditions. Friends, relatives
or neighbors should check on people who may be at risk.</description>
<instruction>Drink plenty of water, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out
of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young
children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles
under any circumstances.
Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When
possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when
possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent
rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone
overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location.
Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1.</instruction>
