<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM MDT TUESDAY...
The following message is transmitted at the request of the New
Mexico Departments of Health and Environment, United States Forest
Service and the Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality Response
Program.
The New Mexico Departments of Health and Environment has issued an
Air Quality Alert, until 1 PM MDT Tuesday.
* WHAT...Smoke from the Black and Bear Trap fires will be transported
toward the east then southeast through late afternoon into the
evening. Transport winds there will diminish after sunset but
increase again from the northwest early Tuesday. The combination of
strong, gusty winds and low humidity will contribute to widespread
critical fire weather conditions for southwest New Mexico and
continued fire growth on Tuesday. Areas to the south and southeast
of these fires may experience moderate to unhealthy impacts at
times the next 24-36 hours. Elsewhere, cooler and more humid air
will generally limit significant smoke production from the Hermits
Peak-Calf Canyon fire with significant impacts remaining localized.
* WHERE...Locations mostly likely to experience the most significant
impacts from smoke include much of Catron, western Socorro County,
northern Grant and western Sierra counties. More details on
impacted locations and latest air quality information can be found
at https://fire.airnow.gov
* WHEN...Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1pm MDT
Tuesday, May 24
* IMPACTS...Those with conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and
heart disease will be especially vulnerable to impacts from poor
air quality, as will adults over age 65, young children, and
pregnant women if smoke concentrations become unhealthy.
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method
available at
https://nmtracking.doh.nm.gov/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart and/or lung
disease, asthma or other respiratory illness. Outdoor activity
should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant women,
and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
