<headline>Red Flag Warning issued May 23 at 1:48PM CDT until May 24 at 9:00PM CDT by NWS El Paso</headline>
<description>...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED ON TUESDAY...
.An upper level system will approach New Mexico Tuesday afternoon
with an increase in winds expected. Very low humidity (6 to
12 percent) is anticipated across much of southwest and south-
central New Mexico and far west Texas, and coupled with the
breezy to windy conditions (20 ft winds 20 to 25 mph), in addition
to very dry fuels, critical fire weather conditions are
anticipated. Across the Sacramento mountains, there is a little
uncertainty in the wind speeds and moisture. Consequently, the Red
Flag Warning has been omitted from this location at this time, but
an upgrade will be possible.
...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM NOON TO 8 PM MDT TUESDAY FOR
STRONG WINDS AND LOW HUMIDITY FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONES 055 AND
056...
The National Weather Service in El Paso Tx/Santa Teresa has
issued a Red Flag Warning, which is in effect from noon to 8 PM
MDT Tuesday.
* AFFECTED AREA...Fire weather zone 055 and 056 in far west Texas.
* WIND...Northwest 20 to 25 mph with gusts up to 35 mph.
* HUMIDITY...6 to 10 percent.
* IMPACTS...any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly.
Outdoor burning is not recommended.</description>
<instruction>A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions
are either occurring now, or will shortly. A combination of
strong winds, low relative humidity, and warm temperatures can
contribute to extreme fire behavior.</instruction>
