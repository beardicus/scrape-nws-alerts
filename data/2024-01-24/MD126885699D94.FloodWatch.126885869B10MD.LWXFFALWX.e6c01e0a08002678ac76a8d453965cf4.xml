<headline>Flood Watch issued January 24 at 2:01PM EST  by NWS Baltimore/Washington</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM 7 PM EST THIS EVENING THROUGH LATE
THURSDAY NIGHT...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rapid snowmelt and heavy rainfall is
possible.
* WHERE...Portions of western Maryland, including the following
areas, Extreme Western Allegany and Garrett and eastern West
Virginia, including the following areas, Western Grant, Western
Mineral and Western Pendleton.
* WHEN...From 7 PM EST this evening through late Thursday night.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Low-water
crossings may be flooded.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Rising temperatures and dewpoints combined with incoming
rainfall will lead to rapid snowmelt over the watch area.
Snow water equivalent values of 2 to 4 inches have been
observed along and west of the Allegheny Front. These values
combined with 0.50 to 1.00 inch of rainfall late tonight
through Friday morning will lead to flooding concerns. Frozen
ground from the recent cold snap and snowfall will also aid
in additional runoff to small streams/creeks as well as main
stem rivers.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
