<instruction>Water levels around ice jams are notoriously unpredictable, and can
change quickly with little or no warning. Anyone living or
recreating near rivers should pay close attention over the next
few days and prepare for additional changes in water levels.
You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
