<description>...Elevated river levels and shifting river ice possible later this
week...
The risk for elevated river levels and shifting river ice will
steadily increase this week due to warming temperatures and light
rainfall. The highest risk for elevated river levels and shifting
river ice is along the Kankakee, Iroquois, and Vermilion rivers,
with a lower risk along the Fox and Illinois rivers.
A substantial snow cover exists across most of northern Illinois,
with water equivalent values up to 2.0 inches. In addition, heavy
ice cover exists on most area rivers with multiple ongoing ice jams,
and near surface soils are frozen to a depth of several inches.
River gauges have indicated that runoff has begun with some snowmelt
partially blocked by the frozen soils underneath. Temperatures are
currently forecasted to remain in the 30s which generally supports a
gradual melt of the snow pack, but there remains a chance for
temperatures late week to reach as high as the lower 40s. Warmer
temperatures would increase the speed of melt and increase the
chance for flooding along streams and rivers. Standing water may
occur small creeks and other poor drainage areas. Shifting river ice
along area rivers remains possible with a risk for break-up ice jams.
This outlook means that elevated water levels and potential impacts
are possible, but not yet certain. Persons with interests along area
rivers should closely monitor the latest forecasts.
This product will be updated by tomorrow afternoon.</description>
