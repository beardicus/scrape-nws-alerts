basement or small central room in a sturdy structure.
For your protection move to an interior room on the lowest floor of a
building.
Continuous cloud to ground lightning are occurring with this storm.
Move indoors immediately. Lightning is one of nature`s leading

be struck by lightning.
Torrential rainfall is also occurring with this storm, and may lead
to flash flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flooded
roadways.</instruction>
