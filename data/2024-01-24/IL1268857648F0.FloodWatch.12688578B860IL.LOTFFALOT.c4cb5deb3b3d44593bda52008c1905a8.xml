<headline>Flood Watch issued January 24 at 8:04PM CST until January 25 at 12:00PM CST by NWS Chicago</headline>
<description>...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and/or snowmelt and/or ice jam
continues to be possible.
* WHERE...Portions of Illinois, including the following areas,
Eastern Will, Ford, Grundy, Iroquois, Kankakee, La Salle,
Livingston and Southern Will and northwest Indiana, including the
following areas, Benton, Jasper, Lake IN, Newton and Porter.
* WHEN...Through Monday morning.
* IMPACTS...Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Poor
drainage areas may become inundated. Storm drains and ditches may
be clogged with snow and ice, causing localized flooding.
Localized water level fluctuations may occur due to shifting river
ice. Ongoing ice jams may break, causing rapid-onset flooding of
areas downstream.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Warming temperatures this week will begin to melt snowpack
across the area which contains 0.5-2.0 inches of water
equivalent. Snow melt, in additional to Thursday rainfall,
may runoff due to frozen soils from recent cold weather.</description>
<instruction>A Flood Watch means flooding is possible, but not yet certain, based
upon the latest forecasts. Persons with interests along area rivers,
creeks, and other waterways should monitor the latest forecasts and
be prepared to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
