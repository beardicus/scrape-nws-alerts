<senderName>NWS Buffalo (Western New York)</senderName>
<headline>Flood Watch issued January 24 at 3:16AM EST until January 24 at 10:00AM EST by NWS Buffalo</headline>
<description>.Several waves of rainfall, today and again Thursday night, will
produce a total of 0.50&quot; to 0.75&quot; of rain over several days. While a
deeper snowpack will absorb some of this rain initially, snowmelt
and runoff will increase by Thursday and Thursday night, bringing
elevated flows to area creeks and rivers.
Recent reports have indicated ice formation on the Buffalo area
creeks, as well as creeks and rivers in the western Southern Tier.
As creeks and rivers rise, a mild airmass well into the 40s, and
possibly lower 50s will encourage the creek and river ice to break,
eventually leading to possible ice jams and subsequent flooding. The
ice is not particularly thick, which will likely limit the potential
for ice jam flooding.
...FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
SATURDAY MORNING...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt, and also ice jam
continues to be possible.
* WHERE...A portion of western New York, including the following
counties, Chautauqua, Northern Erie and Southern Erie.
* WHEN...From Thursday afternoon through Saturday morning.
* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in minor flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
There is a limited risk of ice jams as well on the Buffalo area
creeks and other creeks across the western Southern Tier, with a
chance of minor flooding associated with ice jams.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- The combination of snowmelt and rainfall runoff, combined
with the breakup of creek ice, may bring a limited potential
for minor flooding and minor ice jam flooding in low lying,
flood prone areas.

<instruction>You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood
Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared
to take action should flooding develop.</instruction>
