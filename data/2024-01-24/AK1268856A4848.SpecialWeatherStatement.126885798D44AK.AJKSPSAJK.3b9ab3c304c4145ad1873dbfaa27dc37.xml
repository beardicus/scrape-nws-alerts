<description>...RAIN AND RISING FREEZING LEVELS THROUGH THE WEEKEND...
After a 2 day break, a warm front will cause precipitation to
track back into the region from south to north on Friday. A wind
shift to the south at all levels will allow warming temperatures
through the northern inner channels Friday into Saturday.
Meanwhile, snow/freezing levels will steadily rise. By Saturday
morning freezing levels over the City of Haines will likely have
risen to around 2,000 feet, while the Juneau area will have risen
to nearly 3,000 feet. During Sunday, these values top out at over
3,000 feet for Haines and over 4,000 feet for Juneau and
surrounding areas.
Rainfall totals over this 3 day period are likely to exceed 2
inches across all of SE Alaska and may exceed 4 inches in Juneau.
Rainfall will come in surges with heaviest rates currently
expected on Sunday.
Rain on significant snowpack currently in place can result in
several impacts:
* Snow will become heavier as it absorbs the rain, making it
more difficult to move.
* Heavier snow may affect susceptible properties and vessels.
* Drainage blocked by snow will cause rainfall runoff and
snowmelt onto streets and ponding.
* Rain on hard-pack snow will become icy.
* Snowmelt from high elevation snow will add to runoff.
Please consider your personal property and neighborhood drainage
before the onset of heavy rain. Stay tuned to updates from the
National Weather Service on this developing pattern change.</description>
