<headline>Air Quality Alert issued August 28 at 11:48AM PDT  by NWS Medford</headline>
<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL 5 PM PDT WEDNESDAY...
Oregon Department of Environmental Quality has issued an Air
Quality Advisory for Josephine County and parts of Curry County...in
effect until at least 5 PM PDT Wednesday.
The Rum Creek Wildfire burning in the region combined with forecast
conditions will cause air quality levels to fluctuate and could be at
unhealthy levels.
Smoke levels can change rapidly depending on weather. Check current
conditions on the Oregon Smoke Information Blog, DEQ’s Air Quality
Index, or by downloading the free OregonAIR app on your smartphone.
Smoke can irritate the eyes and lungs and worsen some medical
conditions. People most at risk include infants and young children,
people with heart or lung disease, older adults and pregnant people.
Protect yourself and your family when smoke levels are high:
Stay inside if possible. Keep windows and doors closed. If it’s
too hot, run air conditioning on recirculate or consider moving to a
cooler location. Avoid strenuous outdoor activity.
Use a high efficiency particulate air filter in indoor ventilation
systems or portable air purifiers.
Be aware of smoke in your area and avoid places with the highest
levels.
