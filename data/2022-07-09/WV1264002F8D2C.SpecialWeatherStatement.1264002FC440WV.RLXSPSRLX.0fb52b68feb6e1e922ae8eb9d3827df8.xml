<headline>Special Weather Statement issued July 09 at 10:59AM EDT  by NWS Charleston</headline>
<description>...Torrential downpours will impact portions of northwestern
Raleigh, north central Wyoming, southwestern Fayette and
southeastern Boone Counties through noon...
At 1057 AM EDT, Doppler radar was tracking an area of heavy rain 10
miles east of Bald Knob, or 14 miles west of Beckley, moving east at
20 mph.
1 to 2 inches of rain can be expected in less than an hour. This
will cause elevated levels on small creeks and streams, and ponding
of water in urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses, as well
as other poor drainage areas and low lying spots.
Locations impacted include...
Beckley, Oak Hill, Mount Hope, Mabscott, Crab Orchard, Dry Creek,
Macarthur, Bradley, Piney View, Bald Knob, Stanaford, Prosperity,
Wharton, Beaver, Daniels, Lester, Pax, Dorothy, Stickney and Artie.
This includes the following highways...
West Virginia Turnpike between mile markers 41 and 62.
Interstate 64 in West Virginia between mile markers 122 and 126.
Route 19 between mile markers 1 and 9.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are
potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to travel across
flooded roads. Find alternate routes. It takes only a few inches of
swiftly flowing water to carry vehicles away.
Do not drive your vehicle into areas where the water covers the
roadway. The water depth may be too great to allow your car to cross
safely. Move to higher ground.</description>
