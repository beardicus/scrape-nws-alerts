<description>...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO 8 PM MDT THIS
EVENING FOR GUSTY WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR FIRE
WEATHER ZONES 322 AND 326...
.Hot and dry weather is expected today as high pressure peaks
over the northern Plains. Minimum afternoon relative humidities as
low as 10 percent are expected. West to southwest winds will blow
at 10 to 20 mph with gusts up to 30 mph.
The combination of hot temperatures, low relative humidity, and
gusty winds will produce conditions favorable for large fire
growth this afternoon and early evening across far southwestern
South Dakota. Local fuel conditions may preclude fire growth in
some locations due to the very hit or miss nature of recent
thunderstorms.
