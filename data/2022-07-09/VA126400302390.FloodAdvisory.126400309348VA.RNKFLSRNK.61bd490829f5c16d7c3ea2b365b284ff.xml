<headline>Flood Advisory issued July 09 at 2:44PM EDT until July 09 at 5:30PM EDT by NWS Blacksburg</headline>
<description>...FLOOD ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 345 PM EDT THIS
AFTERNOON...
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.
* WHERE...City of Roanoke and the City of Salem.
* WHEN...Until 345 PM EDT.
* IMPACTS...Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas.
Overflowing poor drainage areas.
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 241 PM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges
indicated that between 1.0 and 1.5 inches of rain fell across
the Salem and Roanoke City areas during the past 1 to 1.5
hours. While the rainfall has diminished, this rainfall
combined with recent repeated rainfall events will result in
quick runoff of additional rainfall. Overflowing poor
drainage areas will result in minor flooding within the
advisory area.
- This includes the following streams and drainages...
Paint Bank Branch, Gum Spring Branch, Roanoke River, Mason
Creek, Murray Run, Cook Creek, Carvin Creek, Back Creek, Gish
Branch and Horners Branch.
Additional rainfall amounts during the next hour or so are
expected to be less than 1/2 inch. This will allow any high
water issues to gradually recede.
- Some locations that could experience flooding include...
Roanoke...                         Salem...
Vinton...                          Cave Spring...

including mudslides or flooded roads, to the National Weather
Service by calling toll free at 1...8 6 6...2 1 5...4 3 2 4. Reports
