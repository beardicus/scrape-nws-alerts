<description>...RED FLAG WARNINGS REMAIN IN EFFECT FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONES 220,
221, 222, 223, AND 224...
.DISCUSSION...Red Flag Warnings for abundant lightning and
extremely dry fuels are in effect for zones 220, 221, 222, 223
and 224 through midnight Monday night.
A thermal low pressure trough stretching from McGrath to Fairbanks
to Eagle will persist into Mon. This, along with a warm and
unstable airmass will cause thunderstorms through Mon. Min RH will
remain 26-40% through Mon. Smokey conditions will continue through Mon.
A series of low pressure troughs aloft will move west across
Eastern Interior over the next several days. These will cause
isolated thunderstorms across the Eastern Interior, with scattered
thunderstorms in the afternoon/evening over the area south of
Fort Yukon through Mon night. Expect 3000 to 5000 lightning
strikes each day. These troughs will also cause significant
rain showers over the areas southeast of Eagle to Kantishna
through Mon night.
A cold front moving east across the Eastern Interior on Tue will
bring cooler temperatures. By Tue thunderstorms will be
confined to isolated east of Fairbanks. Cool conditions are
expected from Wed through the end of the week.
