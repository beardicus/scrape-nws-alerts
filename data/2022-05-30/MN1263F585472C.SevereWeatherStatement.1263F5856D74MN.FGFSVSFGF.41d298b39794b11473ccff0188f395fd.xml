<instruction>TAKE COVER NOW! Move to a basement or an interior room on the lowest

mobile home, or in a vehicle, move to the closest substantial shelter
and protect yourself from flying debris.
If on or near any lake, get away from the water and move to safe
shelter immediately. If you can hear thunder, you are close enough
to be struck by lightning. Severe thunderstorms can produce large
capsizing waves, even on small bodies of water. Move into dock and
seek safe shelter now! Do not be caught on the water in a
thunderstorm.</instruction>
