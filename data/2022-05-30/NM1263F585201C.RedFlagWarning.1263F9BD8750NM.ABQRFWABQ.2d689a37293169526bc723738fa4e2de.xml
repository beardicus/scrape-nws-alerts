FOR THE NORTHEAST HIGHLANDS DUE TO STRONG WINDS, LOW HUMIDITY, AND

.Another round of strong west winds has combined with low
humidities and an unstable airmass to produce widespread critical
fire weather conditions this Memorial Day. Overnight humidity
recoveries were mostly poor as well. Winds turn southerly and will
remain strong enough to combine with high Haines, and single-digit
humidity through the northeast highlands to produce another round
of critical fire weather Tuesday afternoon. A strong wind shift to
the northeast and influx of cooler and more moist air will arrive
once critical fire weather ends Tuesday evening.
