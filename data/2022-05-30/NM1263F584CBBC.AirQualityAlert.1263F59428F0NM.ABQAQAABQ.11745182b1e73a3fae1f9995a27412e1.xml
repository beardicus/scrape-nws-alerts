<description>...AIR QUALITY ALERT...
The following message is transmitted at the request of the New Mexico
Departments of Health and Environment, United States Forest Service
and the Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality Response Program.
* WHAT...Smoke from the Black Fire in the Gila National Forest, which
has grown nearly 50 thousand acres in the past three days, will
continue to have the greatest air quality impacts in the region as
it gets transported east-northeast. Smoke from the Hermits Peak-
Calf Canyon Fire will originate from active fire that is mostly
located at higher elevations along the western periphery with more
isolated impacts at lower elevation communities along the east
slopes of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Overall, haze will persist
away from the larger fires for many other areas. Areas of blowing
dust will, at times, contribute to diminished air quality for lower
elevations through the evening.
* WHERE...Surface smoke impacts will be greatest for portions of the
Mimbres and Rio Grande valleys in southwest New Mexico and the Mora
and Sapello River valleys along the east slopes of the Sangre de
Cristo Mountains. Elsewhere, layered smoke aloft will be most
noticeable in the vicinity of Abo Pass, Carrizozo, Corona, Elephant
Butte, Gran Quivira, Mountainair, Socorro, Truth or Consequences,
and Vaughn. Light to moderate smoke may settle into portions of the
Upper Tularosa Basin and the Highway 380 corridor between San
Antonio and Bingham tonight. More details on impacted locations and
latest air quality information can be found at
https://fire.airnow.gov.
* WHEN...Remainder of this afternoon through at least 1 pm MDT,
Tuesday, May 31, 2022.
* IMPACTS...Those with conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and
heart disease will be especially vulnerable to impacts from poor air
quality, as will adults over age 65, young children, and pregnant
women if smoke concentrations become unhealthy.
* HEALTH INFORMATION...Remember, your eyes are your best tools to
determine if it is safe to be outside. Use the 5-3-1 Method available
at https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/FireAndSmoke.html.
If visibility is:
Under 5 miles, the air quality is unhealthy for young children,
adults over age 65, pregnant women, and people with heart
and/or lung disease, asthma or other respiratory illness.
Outdoor activity should be minimized.
Around 3 miles, young children, adults over age 65, pregnant
women, and people with heart and/or lung disease, asthma or other
respiratory illness should avoid all outdoor activities.
Around 1 mile, the air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People
should remain indoors and avoid all outdoor activities including
running errands. Unless an evacuation has been issued, stay inside
your home, indoor workplace, or in a safe shelter.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting New Mexico and with the
wildfire season underway, New Mexicans will need to take extra
precautions. Smoke from wildfires may cause people to have more
severe reactions if they are infected COVID-19. The best way to
protect against the potentially harmful effects of wildfire smoke and
to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home and create a clean
indoor air space. NMDOH offers tips here:
https://nmtracking.org/environment/air/IndoorQuality.html and
https://cv.nmhealth.org
New Mexicans will also need to take steps to keep their homes cool to
avoid heat-related illnesses. NMDOH offers tips here:
